From January 21st through February 15th, price has risen over 85% of the time over the last 22 years. Daily, the stock is oversold.

Fifth Third Bancorp also reports earnings this week and this report is also likely to be met with buying. Here is why. Daily, there are higher lows in momentum. The January through April time period has been bullish for these shares. In fact, from January 20 through February 16th, the stock has risen about 73% of the time.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. • Trump inauguration, Q4 earnings season will be in focus in the holiday-shortened week ahead. • With its transformative business model and clear growth trajectory, Netflix looks like a compelling buy for investors seeking quality growth. • Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less appealing in the current market environment. • Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe here for 50% off InvestingPro! U.S. stocks rallied on Friday ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had their best week since the November election amid signs of easing inflation. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 3.7% and 2.9%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be another eventful one as investors continue to gauge the outlook for the economy and interest rates. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. President-elect Trump’s inauguration also will be Monday, with the incoming president expected to issue a flurry of day one executive orders. Source: Investing.com Meanwhile, the fourth quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will also be closely watched. Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 20 - Friday, January 24. For investors looking to allocate capital this week, Netflix stands out as a strong growth opportunity. The streaming giant’s shift to advertising, live events, and monetization of popular content like ‘Squid Game’ are significant tailwinds that could propel the stock higher in the week ahead. The Los Gatos, California-based Internet television network is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter update after the U.S. market closes on Tuesday at 4:00PM ET. A call with co-CEO’s Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters is set for 5:00PM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in NFLX stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of nearly 9% in either direction. The stock rose 8.8% after the last earnings report came out in mid-October. Source: InvestingPro Profit estimates have been revised upward 27 times in the last 90 days, reflecting growing confidence among analysts. Only four downward revisions have been noted, underscoring Wall Street’s bullish sentiment toward the entertainment powerhouse. Netflix is seen earning $4.21 per share, representing a staggering 99% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to increase 15% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. The company has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to prioritizing operating margins and revenue expansion. This pivot includes a robust advertising model, which is becoming a cornerstone of its growth strategy. On the content front, the blockbuster release of ‘Squid Game Season 2’ and other high-profile projects ensures a steady stream of engagement. Netflix is also venturing into live events, including NFL games and boxing matches, expanding its appeal to a broader audience. NFLX stock ended at $858.10 last Friday. At current levels, Netflix has a market cap of $366.8 billion. Shares are down 3.7% to start 2025 after scoring an annual gain of 83% last year. Source: Investing.com It is worth mentioning that Netflix has a great InvestingPro Financial Health Score of 3.1/5.0, reflecting its strong financials, robust growth prospects, and innovative strategies.

On the other hand, Procter & Gamble faces operational challenges and tepid growth, making it less attractive in the current market environment. The global consumer products company is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings report before the stock market opens on Wednesday at 6:55AM ET. The expected move in the options market is about 3.4% up or down. Shares fell 1.6% after the last earnings report came out in October. Underscoring several challenges facing Procter & Gamble, 18 out of the 19 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their sales estimates ahead of the print, citing soft consumer demand and a challenging outlook. Source: InvestingPro P&G is seen earning $1.86 per share, increasing just 1.1% from EPS of $1.84 in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, revenue is forecast to inch up 2.2% year-over-year to $21.6 billion. These modest growth projections reflect increasing challenges for the company. The consumer goods giant recently faced operational disruptions, including a ransomware attack on one of its shipping vendors. The attack could weigh on distribution efficiency and hurt margins in the short term. Moreover, rising competition in key markets and inflationary pressures on raw materials are expected to limit profitability. As such, CEO Jon Moeller may strike a cautious tone and give soft guidance to reflect supply chain disruptions and weakening margins. PG stock closed last Friday’s session at $161.13, not far from its lowest level since April 2024. At its current valuation, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods company has a market cap of $379.5 billion. Shares are down 3.8% to start the new year. Source: Investing.com Although P&G remains a dominant player in the consumer goods sector with strong brands like Tide and Gillette, its growth is slowing, and the stock appears fully valued. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.7, the shares may not offer much upside at current levels.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. 79% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost thirty percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: Why Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Received Analyst Approval This Week?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Received Analyst Approval This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other stocks that received analyst approval this week. The US market performance in the last week was quite bullish, with the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ boasting weekly gains of 3.71%, 3.73%, and 3.84% respectively. The week marked the last full week of the outgoing Democratic government, with Donald Trump set to be sworn in early next week. Just like the last time he became President, Donald Trump is set to make some drastic changes once he takes over. His energy policy and stance on crypto will continue to be of focus for most traders. During the outgoing week, a lot of companies received the backing of Wall Street analysts, among them quite a few energy and automobile companies. We looked at a few of those companies that received a boost from analysts this week. To come up with the list of 10 stocks that received analyst approval this week, we only considered companies with a market cap of at least $1 billion. A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment services provider that offers a wide variety of documentaries, games, TV series, and movies. The company’s target price was downgraded from $1065 to $1040 by Oppenheimer based on valuation concerns. However, the analyst acknowledged that there were hardly any business headwinds and didn’t downgrade the rating. Seaport Global upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, showing they were more bullish on the stock than Oppenheimer. At the end of 2024, the stock underperformed the S&P 500. Moreover, the company’s valuation is not attractive right now. At this point, investors are concerned about the continuous decline in share prices since last month. However, as the analyst ratings show, a lot of the current pessimism is priced in. The impact of the second season of Squid Game show will become apparent during this quarter and that could act as a catalyst for the stock’s next rally. There has been a huge transition in the TV and movie industry in the past 10 years. Being a streaming giant NFLX remained on top among its closest competitors (Amazon Prime Video and Disney) in terms of subscriber count. Having a high CFC ratio (the ability to pay back debt) of 22% shows its sound finances, despite having to spend large amounts of money on creating fresh content. Given all this information, Netflix is still the top choice for customers looking for streaming options. Investors can consider this downturn in price as an opportunity to re-analyze their investment strategy. Overall, NFLX ranks 9th on our list of received analyst approval this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Investing.com-- Seaport upgraded its rating on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Wednesday, citing expectations for higher subscriber growth as the streaming giant prepares to report its fourth-quarter earnings next week. Seaport upgraded Netflix to Buy from Neutral, with a price target of $955- representing an upside of 12.5% from Wednesday’s close. The brokerage said it expects higher than initially anticipated additions in members- at 9 million in the fourth quarter, compared to prior expectations of 5.7 million. Seaport also sees Netflix’s original content providing strong tailwinds to the stock, especially with the release of the second season of smash hit Squid Games during the quarter. The brokerage said advertising growth, more top content projects and the winning of live sports rights- such as the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson match- all heralded a positive quarter. “NFLX should remain a core holding due to top-line growth, OI margin expansion, and FCF conversion,” Seaport analysts wrote in a note. Netflix will report its December quarter earnings on January 21. The company is expected to clock earnings per share of $4.2 on revenue of $10.13 billion.
