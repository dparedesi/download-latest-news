By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Netflix, which financial analysts have crowned the undisputed subscription-streaming leader, kicks off the media and entertainment sector’s Q1 earnings this week. Wall Street anticipates that Netflix will report strong results for the period — the first quarter it will no longer disclose subscriber counts — and that the company is relatively well positioned to withstand economic headwinds. Netflix is scheduled to report Q1 2025 results Thursday, April 17, after market close. Wall Street consensus estimates are for quarterly revenue to come in at $10.51 billion (up 12% year over year) with earnings per share of $5.66 (up 7%), according to LSEG Data & Analytics. That’s slightly above the company’s previous guidance for revenue of $10.42 billion and EPS of $5.58.

Popular on Variety For starters, Netflix will not face any significant direct impact from the Trump administration’s tariffs. The TD Cowen analysts also cited “robust underlying biz demand from increasingly global content slate,” Netflix’s strong value proposition especially relative to out-of-home entertainment options, and continued “secular adoption of streaming video.” TD Cowen has a “buy” rating on Netflix with a 12-month price target of $1,150/share. So far in 2025, Netflix shares have outperformed the broader market: The stock is up more than 7% year to date, compared with a decline of more than 10% for the S&P 500 index amid President Trump’s tariff announcements and escalating trade war with China. Seaport Research Partners equity analyst David Joyce similarly noted that Netflix is “one of the cheapest forms of entertainment on a per-hour engagement basis. “Generally speaking, what makes NFLX (and other streamers, of course) a defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it is likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget,” Joyce wrote in an April 14 note. The monthly price of Netflix premium service in the U.S. costs as much as “a single Imax ticket in major markets for 2 hours, or one-fifth of the average price of a single Live Nation ticket for a 2-hour event — not to mention comparing to pro sports events or theme parks,” he added. Joyce rates Netflix a “buy” with a $1,025/share 12-month price target. As Netflix announced last year, beginning with the first quarter of 2025 it will stop reporting paid subscriber numbers and average revenue per member (ARM) on a regular quarterly basis, saying those aren’t as meaningful as user engagement or financial metrics like revenue and operating margin. (Netflix says it “will continue to announce paid memberships as we cross key milestones.”) For Q4 of 2024, Netflix reported 18.9 million net new global subscribers — around twice analyst expectations — to reach 301.6 million at year-end. With the decision to no longer report subscriber figures, “Netflix is now free to focus solely on revenue growth,” Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in an April 11 note. The company in January implemented price hikes across all tiers in the U.S. and other countries; even if that results in subscriber cancellations Netflix can “obscure subscriber churn and trade-downs while showing meaningful revenue growth.” In the absence of subscriber figures, TD Cowen’s Blackledge expects investors to look for updates around Netflix’s “burgeoning ad tier.” Netflix plans to launch first-party advertising tech stack in the U.S. in April after rolling it out in Canada, and “we’ll look for color around potential timing of the remaining 10 ad markets later in 2025,” Blackledge wrote. Netflix earlier this year raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion (up $500 million from its prior forecast) and for operating margin to be 29%, up one percentage point from its previous guidance. With $18 billion in content spending forecast for 2025, “there is meaningful upside potential to Netflix’s 2025 guidance,” Wedbush’s Reese wrote. VIP+ Analysis: Should Netflix Rivals Imitate Its Choice to Hold Back Subscriber Numbers? For 2025, the company has touted the return of three of its biggest TV shows — “Squid Game,” “Wednesday” and “Stranger Things” — and said it plans to “grow into new areas like live programming and games.” Of note, Netflix began streaming WWE “Monday Night Raw” exclusively in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Latin America on a weekly basis in January 2025. It also will reprise its NFL double-header on Christmas Day 2025. “Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding more live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,” Reese wrote. The analyst maintains an “outperform” rating on Netflix with a $1,150/share 12-month price target, reflecting a P/E multiple of 34X on Wedbush’s 2027 EPS estimate. Meanwhile, according to TD Cowen’s monthly survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers, Netflix continues to be the most popular way to watch video content in the living room. Asked which platform consumers use most often to view video content on their TV, Netflix retained the top spot in February 2025 with 25% of respondents, followed by YouTube (15%) and basic cable (10%). “We think Netflix’s broad catalog across multiple genres creates a durable advantage over time,” Blackledge wrote.

Major U.S. equities declined slightly Tuesday, a reprieve from the trade-related volatility that has driven significant swings in stocks in recent weeks. Market indexes ticked lower following rallies in the previous two sessions and despite strong earnings reports from some of the nation's largest banks. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, while the Dow lost 0.4%. The Nasdaq ended Tuesday's session with a minor loss of less than 0.1% Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares surged for the second straight session, adding 6.2% on Tuesday to notch the S&P 500's top daily performance. The push higher for Palantir stock followed reports that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) acquired an artificial intelligence (AI) military solution developed by the big data analytic software firm. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) gained 5.1% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has accumulated a position worth more than $1.5 billion in the IT services provider. People familiar with the matter told Investopedia that Elliott intends to engage with HPE's leadership on potential steps to boost the tech company's value. According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NFLX) executives outlined a set of optimistic objectives at a business review meeting in March. The targets include doubling the company's revenue by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix shares jumped 4.8% ahead of the streaming giant's quarterly earnings report, which is set to be released Thursday afternoon. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, dropped 5.9%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The move lower came after several research firms reduced their price targets on the stock. Analysts pointed to numerous factors behind more muted forecasts for Albemarle, including the potential for trade tensions to weigh on global sales in the automotive sector, which could result in sustained pressure on prices for battery components. Bank of America expressed a cautious view of the chemical sector, pointing to softness in cyclical demand and headwinds related to global trade. Analysts indicated that these factors are contributing to lower levels of confidence around upcoming earnings estimates. BofA downgraded Dow (DOW) stock to "underperform" from "buy," and shares of the chemicals giant lost 4.0% following the double downgrade. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) sank 3.8% after Baird analysts downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." According to the analyst team, companies in the managed care and health care facilities industries could be unlikely to increase their guidance in the near term given policy uncertainties related to Medicare Part D programs.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock. Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a "top pick," expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” All told, 15 of the 19 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a "hold" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest 12% upside, after the stock surged earlier this week following a report Netflix aims to double its revenue and join the $1 trillion market capitalization club by 2030. Netflix is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.47 billion, or $5.67 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier. Netflix shares have risen nearly 60% over the past 12 months, at $975.73 in Thursday afternoon trading. UPDATE—April 17, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.
