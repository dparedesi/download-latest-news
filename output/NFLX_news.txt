Investing.com -- Building on the momentum from the previous week, equities have continued to climb, but not without some volatility following President Trump’s inauguration. Here's a look at some of the names that stood out: To start things off, Oracle and Softbank. Shares of both companies rallied this week following the announcement of a joint venture, Stargate, with OpenAI and MGX. President Trump announced the venture, which aims to invest up to $500 billion in developing AI infrastructure within the United States. RBC Capital explained in a note that “SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners, where OpenAI has operational responsibility and SoftBank (TYO:9984) has financial responsibility. Masayoshi Son (CEO of SoftBank) will be the chairman. Shares of Oracle rallied 7%, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 4%, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 4%, while the IGV was up 2%.” The news was also helpful for Microsoft, Nvidia, Arm, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) and SMCI. “In the Stargate partnership, Microsoft is described as a “technology partner”, not a funding partner,” added RBC. “We view the formation of Stargate as slightly positive for both Microsoft and Oracle in our coverage, primarily from the standpoint that both can benefit from close ties to a new administration focused on defending domestic AI leadership. They added: “On the other hand, we question how much of the move in shares of Oracle has been driven by the announcement, versus encouraging news related to TikTok." Netflix shares surged Wednesday after it reported its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the close, topping top and bottom-line expectations. “NFLX reported 4Q24 revenue ~1% above the Street and operating income 2% above the consensus. In addition, Netflix reported 18.9 million net adds during the quarter, well above the VA consensus (+9.6 million),” explained Citi analysts following the announcement. “The company’s 1Q25 outlook came in below consensus estimates. However, NFLX raised its 2025 revenue and operating income margin outlook, which on a midpoint basis fall above Street estimates.” Various analysts raised their target for Netflix following the earnings report, with Goldman Sachs lifting theirs to $960. “The company’s messaging remains consistent heading into 2025 (with forward guidance providing proof points of the narrative building) - solid revenue compounding, subscriber growth aided by ad mix, solid/rising operating margin and a commitment to return free cash flow to shareholders via buyback,” said the investment bank. “Looking long term, this array of business model and product initiatives likely set up NFLX as a sustained double-digit revenue growth compounder with margin expansion in the coming years.” EA shares sank more than 16% on Thursday in reaction to its quarterly earnings release, which saw the video game maker cut its bookings guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The lowered guidance followed weaker demand for its soccer franchise, EA Sports FC and the role-playing game Dragon Age. EA CEO Andrew Wilson said: “Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations.” Following the earnings release, Bank of America downgraded EA to Neutral from Buy, saying it is “no longer confident that EA can gain enough share of player engagement and spend to drive meaningful growth in a struggling PC/Console game industry.” Finally, Tempus AI rallied this week, starting with a more than 35% jump in Tuesday’s session. The rise came after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disclosed that she had purchased call options on the stock. Pelosi disclosed in a filing that she had purchased 50 call options in the AI firm with a strike price of $20 and an expiration date of Jan 16, 2026, for between $50,000 to $100,000 earlier this month. Elsewhere on Tuesday, the company announced the national launch of olivia, its AI-enabled personal health concierge app.

Title: Signal: Surging Netflix Stock Could Hit Four Digits, And Soon

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.

US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4.

Title: Good Grief, Look How Much Wall Street Thinks Netflix Is Worth Now

Netflix had an incredible final quarter of 2024, and today the company — and its investors — are reaping the spoils. Shares in Netflix (NFLX on the NASDAQ) skyrocketed $100 apiece on Tuesday afternoon following the release of the company’s fourth-quarter financials. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix revealed record growth of nearly 19 million subscribers, absolutely blowing away media analysts’ forecasts. Netflix revenue topped $10 billion, though its quarterly profit declined. No matter, there’s a fix for that: Netflix also announced price increases across each of its subscription plans. In turn, Netflix forecast better-than-previously-expected revenue growth for the current quarter, Q1 of 2025. Wall Street loves that stuff. Related Stories ‘The Night Agent’ Season 2 Finale: No Good Deed Goes Unpunished Every Mindy Kaling Production, Ranked How much? We can quantify that. When the stock exchanges opened this morning, NFLX shares nearly hit $1,000 apiece (instead settling for an all-time high of $999). Netflix’s market cap is now north of $400 billion; remember when Blockbuster Video passed on buying the company at $50 million? For some recent perspective on the surge in Netflix’s valuation, in fall 2021, before The Great Netflix Correction, shares appeared to be headed for $700. After reporting a shocking loss in subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, shares of NFLX dropped below $200. It’s been quite the comeback. And media analysts see no ceiling. Well, that’s not entirely correct — it’s more like they just vaulted the ceiling to the roofline. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a research analyst for Bank of America and a regular interviewer on Netflix’s earnings “call” (Netflix for many years conducted a prerecorded video interview format and not a live call), already saw NFLX at being worth $1,000; now, she’s all the way up to $1,175. Jason Helstein of Oppenheimer raised his own target from $1,040 to $1,150. It’s a popular price target (PT): Tim Nollen from Macquarie is at the same number, up from $965. As is Alicia Reese of Wedbush, now $200 above her prior $950 target; John Hodulik of UBS is also at $1,150, up a whole $10 from his prior PT of $1,140. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI is up from $950 to $1,100. Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities is either nuts or a prophet — not to be confused with “profit,” which is what you would make if his investment advice comes true — hiking his price target all the way from $680 to $1,494. Somebody wake the boys at Deutsche Bank: Bryan Kraft, Spencer Amer, Benjamin Soff, and Victor-A Odiwuor are at $875 per share. They’re either late to the party or just slow-playing: DB’s prior NFLX PT was $650. With $1,000 clearly in sight, Netflix could be headed for its first stock split in a decade. While none of this (from us) should be considered investment advice, it does have my IndieWire 401k wondering: Where can I find a time machine back to the DVD days?
