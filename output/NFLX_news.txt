Earnings growth is expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from ... [+] the double-digit pace of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, earnings growth was expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of the second quarter. Topline sales were forecasted to grow by 4.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025 were predicted to increase by 14.8% and 15%, respectively. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Earnings season began last Friday with a handful of companies, dominated by financials, reporting earrings. 44 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, heavily emphasizing banks, but many industries are represented. Among the banks reporting are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and PNC Financial (PNC). There are a smattering of other companies on the calendar, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CSX (CSX), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Progressive (PGR). S&P 500 Earnings Season JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings last Friday, getting the bank earnings season off to a good start. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate for the financial sector increased to 1.6% from -0.7% year-over-year due to the better earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The pace of loan growth for the banking industry has been slow, which should weigh on earnings growth. However, investment banking and wealth management revenues continue to benefit from strong markets, benefitting earnings at the money center banks relative to smaller banks. Bank Loan Growth The technology sector should report the most robust earnings growth at 15.5% year-over-year. NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA) should be the most significant contributor to the sector’s earnings. NVIDIA’s profits are expected to soar by 84% year-over-year on the strength of demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors. According to FactSet, the sector’s earnings growth would be 7.5% without the boost from NVIDIA. After some poor headline growth numbers for healthcare due primarily to acquisition-related write-offs, the sector should show some earnings life this quarter at 11.2% year-over-year growth. Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Moderna (MRNA) are expected to be the primary drivers of the profit increase, according to FactSet. The communications services sector rounds out the top three in forecasted year-over-year earnings growth at 10.5%. Not surprisingly, Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to be responsible for most of the growth. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector The energy sector earnings are forecasted to have the worst showing for the third quarter, with a 19.1% year-over-year decline. Natural gas and oil prices fell, resulting in an expected decline in revenues for the energy industry. Energy Commodities Two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) top ten largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire has amassed an almost 28% stake in Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Estimated 5% nominal year-over-year economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 4.7% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 with some upside. GDP Growth Drives S&P 500 Sales Despite a more challenging start to the year, the pace of inflation growth has seen a general downtrend, which should help earnings this quarter. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year The differential in price growth for producer’s input costs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers (CPI) indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady or increase this quarter. The topline sales growth, driven by economic activity in the quarter and supportive margins, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. Margins & Inflation The slightly weaker U.S. dollar could positively impact earnings growth from multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. U.S. Dollar Softens Following the robust monthly jobs report, the markets repriced the pace of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fed Fund futures now indicate a slightly less than 100% probability of a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut in November and December. The September retail sales reading on Thursday is the next significant indicator of the strength of the U.S. consumer and economy. Fed Rate Cuts Expected The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have continued to outperform the less sensitive defensives, implying that stocks are pricing in a higher probability that the U.S. avoids an economic recession. The relative performance of cyclicals versus defensives is nearing the trailing one-year high, reached in mid-July 2024. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The third quarter’s mid-single-digit year-over-year earnings gains provide a seemingly low hurdle for this earnings season. The profit growth should be achievable, assisted by topline sales boosted by solid economic growth. With the fear of recession fading reflected in stock prices and faster earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter and 2025, more attention will likely be paid to management’s future earnings guidance than the third quarter’s earnings beats. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), CSX (CSX), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), NVIDIA (NVDA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.
