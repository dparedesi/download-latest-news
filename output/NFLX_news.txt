It's a short trading week due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but there is still plenty happening. Stock and bond markets are closed for the holiday on Monday, the day the World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland. President Donald Trump is expected to speak on Wednesday in Davos, where he is expected to address housing market reforms and other economic topics. The delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures price index for October and November is scheduled for release, as is the final reading for third-quarter Gross Domestic Product. Netflix and Intel lead the tech firms on this week’s earnings calendar. United Airlines, Johnson & Johnson, Travelers Companies, GE Aerospace, and 3M are also reporting this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Housing affordability is expected to be a key topic for Trump during his Wednesday address in Davos. He has announced several housing market reform proposals, including banning large institutional investors from buying homes and instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase mortgage bonds to help lower borrowing costs. PCE inflation data for October and November will be released on Thursday as the Bureau of Economic Analysis continues to catch up on reports delayed by last year’s government shutdown. The Fed’s preferred measure of prices follows last week’s Consumer Price Index report showing that inflation continued to cool. Officials will be closely watching the inflation reading ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, with central bankers divided over whether to continue to lower interest rates. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fed Governor Lisa Cook's challenge to Trump's efforts to fire her. Netflix’s report and commentary, set for Tuesday, could offer additional insight into the streaming giant’s efforts to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, which could be upgraded to an all-cash offer to match bids from rival Paramount Skydance. Netflix missed on its most recent quarterly earnings due to a tax hit in Brazil. Also reporting is Intel, the stock of which stock has been surging on optimism over its new AI PC chip and significant investments into the company from the U.S. government, Nvidia, and others. GE Aerospace, also slated to report, has seen its stock price near all-time highs after its most recent earnings showed strong demand for commercial and military aviation. Investors will be watching United Airlines’ report after rival Delta Air Lines reported a weaker-than-expected profit outlook, sending shares of airlines lower. Several Dow Jones Industrial Average components are also scheduled this week, including 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Travelers Companies.

Title: Could Netflix Throw More Cash Into Its Warner Bros. Deal? Investors Are Wondering

Cash is king. Investors tracking the streaming-media M&A saga of the moment may need to decide whose is more regal. Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is reportedly considering an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD), a change to its previous cash-and-stock bid that would appear to take a direct shot at Paramount Skydance's (PSKY) rival proposal. News of Netflix's possible change dropped after Paramount Skydance ratcheted up its hostile bid for Warner Bros. on Monday; the latest twist would appear to simplify the terms for shareholders weighing the two offers, though it was unclear exactly how much Netflix might offer in a cash-only deal, which hasn't been announced. Neither Paramount nor Netflix responded to Investopedia's query in time for publication. Industry consolidation has historically led to higher prices—not great news for consumers who have been paying more and more for streaming services in recent years. That's one of the concerns some have about what might happen if Warner Bros. Discovery gets pulled into another company. Netflix's stock climbed after Bloomberg first reported that the company was working on revising the terms of its acquisition late Tuesday. Its stock is down more than 1% so far today and is at its lowest price since it and Warner announced their agreement in early December. Paramount's stock, down just under 1%, is also near lows struck after the company muscled in. To recap: Shortly after Netflix announced its cash-and-stock deal to purchase Warner Bros. in December, Paramount Skydance made its own offer public, saying its all-cash bid was better than the streaming company's cash-and-stock one. It has since been campaigning to bring shareholders to its side, and amended its proposal to address some of the reasons Warner outlined for rejecting it in private negotiations. On Monday, Paramount ratcheted up the pressure, saying it intended to nominate directors for election at Warner Bros.' annual meeting and that it would solicit votes against the Netflix agreement. The company also sued Warner Bros. that same day for more information about its deal with Netflix. If Netflix's all-cash offer materializes, Paramount may have to come up with a different argument for why shareholders should choose its proposal, or lean on its other points—mainly, it argues, a faster timeline and greater certainty of closing. In the meantime, some investors are happy with the possibility of more cash on the table, as well as more competition for Warner Bros. “We’re pleased with the bidding war here,” Oakmark fund manager Bill Nygren told CNBC on Wednesday.
