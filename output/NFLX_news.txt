Stocks closed another week at record highs as investors began to digest quarterly earnings releases and debate intensified over what the Federal Reserve will do at its November meeting. For the week, the Nasdaq (^IXIC), the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1%, with both the Dow and S&P 500 closing at all-time highs Friday. In the week ahead, a monthly report on retail sales will lead the economic calendar as investors assess whether or not the economy is reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. In corporate news, the results from Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) will round out earnings from big banks, while reports from United Airlines (UAL) and Netflix (NFLX) will also highlight the week. In the past week, speculation that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates further at its November meeting has been growing. The September jobs report, which included another decline in the unemployment rate and one of the highest monthly payroll addition numbers of the year, helped ease fears that the labor market was rapidly deteriorating. On Thursday, the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed core prices increased more than expected. On Friday, the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) told a similar story, with core prices increasing 2.8%, compared to Wall Street's expectations for a 2.6% increase. Some have argued that given this data — as well as recent minutes from the Fed's September meeting revealing "some" officials would've supported a smaller interest rate cut — the central bank is likely to hold rates steady in November. "As long as inflation isn't getting towards 2% so dramatically and there's no crisis that unfolds in the labor market, which I don't foresee, I don't think there's anything that gives the Fed reason to cut further this year," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. As of Friday, markets were pricing a roughly 18% chance the Fed doesn't cut in November, up from a 3% chance seen a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Stronger-than-expected economic data has helped drive the "no cut" discussion. Investors will have another update in that department this week with the release of the September retail sales report on Thursday. Economists expect that retail sales increased 0.2% in September from the prior month. In August, retail sales rose 0.1%, defying the decline economists had projected. "Retail sales, in particular, could be a significant market mover as variance in the series has increased, and scrutiny over the health of the consumer has intensified," Jefferies' economics team led by Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "We would warn that one should not read too deeply into a miss against consensus (upside or downside) because retail sales measures spending with a very heavy weighting towards goods rather than services, and it is measured in nominal terms. Weakness may just be due to continued disinflation or deflation in goods." Big banks largely passed Wall Street's test to open earnings season. Investor focus will remain on financials early in the week with reports from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America before shifting to Netflix results on Thursday after the bell. The streaming giant's stock is up about 50% this year and trading near an all-time high. Wall Street expects Netflix to report earnings per share of $5.16 on revenue of $9.77 billion. This would represent nearly 40% earnings growth compared to the year prior. But Wall Street is heavily debating whether or not the stock can sustain its massive run. In the near term, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet believes Netflix announcing further price hikes in the US could be a catalyst for the stock. "We expect Netflix’s stock to trade higher on a US price hike announcement, but we would expect shares to eventually trade lower as investor’s hopes for $25 in 2025 earnings per share are dashed," Bazinet wrote. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) is hovering near 4.1% for the first time since late July. The 10-year has now added roughly 30 basis points over the past week as investors have scaled back their expectations for interest rate cuts amid signs that inflation may be stickier than initially thought while economic growth data holds steady. For much of the past few years, higher yields have been a headwind for stocks. But Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Thursday yields likely have not risen enough to be too much of a headwind just yet. "I don't think this backup in interest rates is all that worrisome for equities in aggregate," Kantrowitz said. "But where it does show up is in leadership." Kantrowitz pointed out that areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had benefited from investors anticipating lower rates, have lagged amid the 10-year yield's recent rise. For now, Kantrowitz added, rising rates are determining market leadership more than they are weighing on the S&P 500 index. "If rates keep going higher, I don't think it's a massive issue for equities unless it persists for, I'd say, a few months," he said.

Title: What To Watch As Third-Quarter 2024 Earnings Season Begins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/13/what-to-watch-as-third-quarter-2024-earnings-season-begins/
Time Published: 2024-10-13T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Earnings growth is expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from ... [+] the double-digit pace of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, earnings growth was expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of the second quarter. Topline sales were forecasted to grow by 4.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025 were predicted to increase by 14.8% and 15%, respectively. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Earnings season began last Friday with a handful of companies, dominated by financials, reporting earrings. 44 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, heavily emphasizing banks, but many industries are represented. Among the banks reporting are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and PNC Financial (PNC). There are a smattering of other companies on the calendar, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CSX (CSX), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Progressive (PGR). S&P 500 Earnings Season JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings last Friday, getting the bank earnings season off to a good start. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate for the financial sector increased to 1.6% from -0.7% year-over-year due to the better earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The pace of loan growth for the banking industry has been slow, which should weigh on earnings growth. However, investment banking and wealth management revenues continue to benefit from strong markets, benefitting earnings at the money center banks relative to smaller banks. Bank Loan Growth The technology sector should report the most robust earnings growth at 15.5% year-over-year. NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA) should be the most significant contributor to the sector’s earnings. NVIDIA’s profits are expected to soar by 84% year-over-year on the strength of demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors. According to FactSet, the sector’s earnings growth would be 7.5% without the boost from NVIDIA. After some poor headline growth numbers for healthcare due primarily to acquisition-related write-offs, the sector should show some earnings life this quarter at 11.2% year-over-year growth. Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Moderna (MRNA) are expected to be the primary drivers of the profit increase, according to FactSet. The communications services sector rounds out the top three in forecasted year-over-year earnings growth at 10.5%. Not surprisingly, Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to be responsible for most of the growth. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector The energy sector earnings are forecasted to have the worst showing for the third quarter, with a 19.1% year-over-year decline. Natural gas and oil prices fell, resulting in an expected decline in revenues for the energy industry. Energy Commodities Two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) top ten largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire has amassed an almost 28% stake in Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Estimated 5% nominal year-over-year economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 4.7% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 with some upside. GDP Growth Drives S&P 500 Sales Despite a more challenging start to the year, the pace of inflation growth has seen a general downtrend, which should help earnings this quarter. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year The differential in price growth for producer’s input costs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers (CPI) indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady or increase this quarter. The topline sales growth, driven by economic activity in the quarter and supportive margins, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. Margins & Inflation The slightly weaker U.S. dollar could positively impact earnings growth from multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. U.S. Dollar Softens Following the robust monthly jobs report, the markets repriced the pace of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fed Fund futures now indicate a slightly less than 100% probability of a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut in November and December. The September retail sales reading on Thursday is the next significant indicator of the strength of the U.S. consumer and economy. Fed Rate Cuts Expected The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have continued to outperform the less sensitive defensives, implying that stocks are pricing in a higher probability that the U.S. avoids an economic recession. The relative performance of cyclicals versus defensives is nearing the trailing one-year high, reached in mid-July 2024. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The third quarter’s mid-single-digit year-over-year earnings gains provide a seemingly low hurdle for this earnings season. The profit growth should be achievable, assisted by topline sales boosted by solid economic growth. With the fear of recession fading reflected in stock prices and faster earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter and 2025, more attention will likely be paid to management’s future earnings guidance than the third quarter’s earnings beats. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), CSX (CSX), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), NVIDIA (NVDA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.
