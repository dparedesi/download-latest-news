As markets swirl amid tariffs and trade war concerns, one company is looking rather recession-proof: Netflix (NFLX). The company was one of the rare bright spots in trading Monday, rising almost 2% after delivering a blockbuster first quarter that had experts comparing the company with Big Tech instead of Big Media. Netflix posted nearly $3 billion in profit and a 31.7% operating margin on $10.5 billion in revenue. Netflix is outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices as of midday Monday, which had declines of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively.​ The company is up 12% year-to-date, while the S&P and Nasdaq are down 12.5% and 18%. An analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” The report’s key takeaways included that price hikes are performing in line with expectations and retention is strong and stable; that the advertising business is successfully scaling; and that Netflix’s large, monetizable audience should allow the company to maintain its edge over competitors. “Netflix disclosed its audience is larger than 700 million people, with more than two-thirds of the audience outside the United States,” analysts wrote. “Given its content diversification strategy of making original content for global countries, this should allow the company to maintain its scaled competitive advantage.” Netflix expects its second quarter revenue to be slightly above Wall Street’s expectation at roughly $11 billion. Its 2025 revenue is still expected to be between $43.5 and $44.5 billion. Netflix does have areas where it can improve, however, according to the William Blair analysts. Namely: its advertising product. Earlier this month, the company rolled out its ads suite in the U.S. and will start rolling its product out to other advertising markets. “In our view, this is important because the advertisers we have spoken with suggest Netflix needed to improve its advertising platform. The new platform will provide advertisers with better measurement and targeting, new ad formats, and advanced programmatic capabilities,” the analysts wrote. The company is looking at other ways to expand, too. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in an earnings call Thursday that video podcasts may be the next format to land on the platform, potentially pulling business from Spotify (SPOT) and YouTube (GOOGL). Other analysts shared William Blair’s optimism. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note published Sunday that “Netflix [is] playing offense, while stock remains defensive.” And Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein called the company “the cleanest story in internet” following its first quarter results.

U.S. stocks dropped sharply Monday, continuing a volatile stretch for Wall Street as geopolitical tensions, earnings anxiety, and Federal Reserve uncertainty continue to collide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the losses, down 2.6% at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 off 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 972 points, or 2.5%. The VIX jumped more than 12% as gold surged to a record $3,432 per ounce. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low, and stocks fell further after President Donald Trump again fiercely criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his pressure campaign on the central bank to cut interest rates. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump said on his social media site Truth Social. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation. With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest salvo against Powell came days after he said the central bank chief’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” The attacks have deepened investor fears over the Fed’s independence and added to the broader sense of policy unpredictability driving market volatility. It’s no mystery: Long-term investors and operators alike know that trust and stability are core to functioning markets. When leadership injects chaos or undermines institutional credibility, the costs show up everywhere — from higher borrowing rates to delayed investment decisions. Nvidia stock dropped 4.5% after new White House export restrictions on its AI chips appeared to hand a competitive edge to Chinese rivals such as Huawei, which reportedly plans to ship its own advanced chip to local customers as soon as next month. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 6% ahead of Tuesday’s earnings as investors brace for lackluster results and look for any sign of stabilization in demand or margins. With more than 100 companies reporting earnings this week — including Tesla, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Boeing (BA), and Procter & Gamble (PG) — traders are looking for any signs of resilience, or at least clarity, as a chaotic second quarter kicks into gear. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was down after reports that Huawei will begin mass shipments of a new AI chip to Chinese customers as soon as next month. The move highlights Beijing’s push to reduce reliance on U.S. technology — and deepens investor anxiety around Nvidia’s access to the massive Chinese market after the White House imposed additional rules on the company’s chip sales. It’s been a whiplash month for equities, with intraday swings as large as 5% and every major index well off its pre-“Liberation Day” levels. The coming week may determine whether that trend deepens... or finally breaks. Earnings from tech giants, including Tesla and Google, will be scrutinized not just for growth but for signs of stability in a market that’s grown more erratic by the day. With so many companies reporting this week, the next few days could set the tone for the rest of the second quarter. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said in a Sunday note. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” The difference, Wedbush noted, is that this time the damage is “self-inflicted,” concluding bluntly: “We are heading into a tech earnings season that we expect minimal/no guidance as C-level executives are playing darts blindfolded with gauging the growth and spending plans of their customers.” One bright spot? Netflix (NFLX). In the first quarter of 2025, the company posted an almost-$3-billion profit on $10.54 billion in revenue — with an eye-popping 31.7% operating margin. Wall Street seems especially approving of Netflix’s ad-supported $7.99 monthly membership, which appears less vulnerable to recession-driven household savings measures. Netflix stock rose 1.6% on Monday. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Watch These Netflix Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Strong Earnings

Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped in extended trading Thursday after the streaming giant posted first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, boosted by higher subscription prices and ad revenues. Through Thursday's close, Netflix shares have gained 9% since the start of the year and trade nearly 60% higher over the past 12 months as the company continues to grow its advertising sales and live events content. Analysts have also touted Netflix’s ability to withstand an economic downturn amid uncertainty related to tariffs, with JPMorgan describing it as the “most resilient” company it tracks. Netflix has also attracted attention for its attempt to double its revenue and achieve a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030, which the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Below, we take a closer look at Netflix’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching. After setting their record high in February, Netflix shares retraced as much as 23% before bulls stepped in to support the stock last week near the 50-week moving average. It’s worth noting that the rebound coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving higher from the 50 threshold, a reading that has marked the bottom of several prior pullbacks in the stock since early 2023. More recently, the shares continued to gain momentum leading into the streamer’s quarterly results, with the price set to open around the psychological $1,000 level on Monday morning. (U.S. markets are closed Friday in commemoration of Good Friday.) Let’s identify two key overhead areas on Netflix’s chart that investors may be watching and also point out important support levels to monitor during retracements. Netflix shares rose 3.5% to around $1,007 in after-hours trading Thursday. The first overhead area to keep tabs on sits at $1,065. Investors who bought shares during the pullback could decide to place sell orders near the stock’s all-time high (ATH). We can project an upside target to watch above the ATH by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the tool to Netflix’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the stock’s trend higher from August to December last year and overlay them from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $1,300, about 34% above Thursday’s closing price. The earlier trend played out over 17 weeks before the stock consolidated, indicating a similar trending move may last until early August if price action rhymes. During retracements, investors should keep track of the $821 level. A retest of this area could see investors seek entry points near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with the end of a five-week losing streak in early January. Finally, selling below this level sets the stage for a possible fall to around $697. Netflix shares could encounter support in this region near last year’s prominent July swing high and a period of sideways drift on the chart between mid-August and late September.
