Title: Netflix Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has shown remarkable performance, increasing by 45% in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately $1,100 for each share. This surge has been fueled by the company's efforts to tackle password sharing and the introduction of its advertising-supported streaming option, although the stock has experienced a minor sell-off in recent times. After reaching a peak of roughly $1,340 in June, it has declined due to Q3 earnings that fell short of expectations, resulting in Netflix revenues and margins coming in below projections. Despite the recent drop, the stock still trades at around 45 times the forecasted earnings. We think the stock faces significant downside risk at such high levels. With increasing macroeconomic uncertainties and indications that subscriber growth may decelerate, investors might be overlooking possible risks. In our opinion, the stock could decline drastically — potentially falling below $500 per share. A 50% correction may seem drastic, but it would not be without precedent. This has occurred before and could likely happen again. However, any potential correction would not necessarily arise from a breakdown in Netflix’s fundamentals, but rather from a recalibration of its valuation multiple as growth begins to stabilize. Investing in single stocks can be risky, yet there is significant value in utilizing a broader, diversified strategy. If you're looking for some upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) — HQ has outperformed its benchmark, a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential — consider what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you incorporated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ's performance metrics. Netflix's subscriber growth could eventually decelerate as significant measures like the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported plans have typically been implemented across major markets. These initiatives were substantial strategic changes aimed at creating new revenue streams and enlarging the user base after growth stagnated following the pandemic. However, demand may have been pulled forward that might have otherwise emerged over the next few years, leading to softer subscriber additions in the future. The company’s intent to cease reporting subscriber figures from 2025 might also reflect internal expectations for slower growth ahead. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid user count to nearly 302 million by the end of the year, marking a record annual increase that considerably propelled the stock’s upward trajectory. Growth was mainly stimulated by the crackdown on password sharing, which incentivized users to either purchase extra member access or create new accounts. Simultaneously, the ad-supported tier gained substantial traction, with Netflix reporting last quarter that it had over 94 million ad-supported users. While Netflix is becoming more efficient in monetizing its ads, subscriber growth has been a fundamental driver of the company’s expansion. With these significant growth levers now mostly exhausted, Netflix may find it challenging to maintain its present momentum, which could have repercussions on the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty and rising costs could also pressure Netflix, which heavily relies on consumer spending. The introduction of tariffs on essential trading partners is already causing inflation in the U.S. to rise. This may decrease disposable income and, in turn, potentially weaken consumer spending. This situation could be detrimental for Netflix, which depends on discretionary income. Additionally, Netflix’s plans have become pricier, with its premium plan now priced at $25 a month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This may result in a slowdown in new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content expenses are set to increase as it delves deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, which typically incur higher production and licensing costs. Although the recent decline in Q3 operating margin to 28% — against a predicted 31.5% — largely resulted from an unforeseen tax dispute in Brazil, margins may remain susceptible as spending pressures accumulate. For the entirety of 2025, Netflix now anticipates an operating margin of 29%, slightly down from its earlier forecast of 30%. NFLX stock has experienced slightly better performance compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent market downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on NFLX stock?

At the current share price of $1,100, Netflix trades at approximately 45 times consensus earnings for 2025 and around 34 times the consensus earnings for 2026, which is high compared to historical standards. In contrast, the stock was trading at approximately 20 times earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial results have been robust, markets can be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the distant future. In Netflix’s situation, the prevailing assumption is that the company will sustain its strong sequence of subscriber acquisitions and likely grow revenues comfortably in double digits. Nevertheless, there’s a real chance that Netflix will soon witness a slowdown in growth, as the combined advantages of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, all while economic uncertainties continue to rise in the U.S. Essentially, the downside risk here lies less in Netflix’s business viability and more in the extent to which investors are prepared to pay for its next phase of slower, more mature growth. Worried about Netflix stock's high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
