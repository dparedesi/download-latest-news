Investing Stocks open Monday, hoping to end a two-week losing streak as fourth-quarter earnings reports return and take center stage. With volatility cooling somewhat, investors can get back to focusing on economic fundamentals and earnings reports. One nagging concern that reemerged last week was private credit funding, which many on Wall Street, including JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, are worried about. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading flat as we get ready to start the new trading week, and despite a strong rebound last Wednesday through Friday, we still ended with our second straight losing week. As the smoke cleared from the Greenland turmoil and no new tariffs were imposed on Europe, investors renewed scrutiny of fourth-quarter earnings, which so far have been solid. With 1/5 of the S&P 500 set to report and hundreds of other stocks also releasing data, plus more economic reports set to hit the tape this week, there could be another batch of volatility-driven swings coming our way to move stocks. The Dow Jones Industrials fell by 0.58% to close at 49,098, while the S&P 500 ended the Friday session flat at 6,915, down just 0.03%. The big loser on Friday was the Russell 2000, which has been the leading index so far this year. It closed down 1.82% at 2,669. Yields were down across almost the entire yield curve, extending a three-day recovery, as the market stabilized following a volatile week driven by trade tensions, potential tariff threats from President Trump regarding Greenland, and global issues, particularly the Japanese bond market turbulence, which saw yields rise on some maturities by almost 30 basis points. The 30-year long bond finished Friday at 4.83%, while the benchmark ten-year note was last seen at 4.23%. Prices across the energy complex rose by almost 3% on Friday, driven primarily by intensified geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as the U.S. has dispatched an “armada” of warships toward Iran, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. In addition, new U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil vessels and reports of production issues in Kazakhstan further added to the upward pressure for the black gold. Brent Crude closed Friday at $65.88, up 2.84%, while West Texas Intermediate ended trading at $61.07, up 2.88%. Natural gas extended its parabolic move, tacking on another 4.56% to close at $5.28. Over the course of last week, it rose by more than 70% as frigid weather sparked demand and heightened concerns about potential production freeze-offs. After another stellar week for precious metals, it continued on Friday, with Gold finishing the day up 0.96% at $4,983. During the week, the analysts at Goldman Sachs lifted their year-end target for Gold to $5,400 from $5,000. Silver was last seen Friday at $103.08, up a whopping 7.31%. Crypto markets saw some severe downward pressure on Friday with major cryptocurrencies dropping as investors shifted toward safe-haven assets like gold amid rising U.S.-NATO tensions, reversing some of the week’s earlier gains. Bitcoin hovered around $89,500 after a 0.4% decline, while Ethereum dropped 2.1% and XRP fell 2.5% in early trading, following a volatile week of “yo-yoing” prices. As of 8 A.M. EST, Bitcoin was trading at $87,710, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,899, down 1.3%. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.
