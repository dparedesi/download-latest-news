ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 Glenview Trust, Strategas The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Glenview Trust, Bloomberg Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Glenview Trust, Bloomberg The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Glenview Trust, Bloomberg Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Glenview Trust, Bloomberg Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season Glenview Trust, FactSet The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Glenview Trust, Bloomberg Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains Glenview Trust, Strategas It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Netflix (NFLX) is scheduled to report first-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts suggesting the streaming giant could be well-positioned to weather an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan called Netflix the “most resilient” company it tracks, given the streamer's strong subscriber base, with members watching an average of two hours of content per day. The bank holds an “overweight” rating and $1,025 price target for the stock. Morgan Stanley also named Netflix a "top pick," expecting the company could “demonstrate relative resilience in a weaker global macro.” The analysts called the pullback in Netflix shares in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on April 2 a “buying opportunity” for investors. All told, 14 of the 18 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock, with the remainder issuing a "hold" rating. Their consensus price target of about $1,097 would suggest nearly 20% upside from Friday’s close. Netflix is expected to report revenue of $10.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and net income of $2.48 billion, or $5.69 per share, rising from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier. Netflix shares have risen nearly 50% over the past 12 months, at $918.29 as of Friday's close.

(Photo by Fred TANNEAU / AFP) (Photo by FRED TANNEAU/AFP via Getty Images) We’re concerned about Netflix’s earnings. Over the past five years, there have been 19 earnings reports. Following these reports, the stock experienced a negative one-day return 12 times, with a median of -7% and max 1D negative returns of -35%. These aren’t comforting numbers. That said, we like a lot about Netflix, especially right now. Ramp-up of Live TV and sports is one. We explain the positives and negatives below. Netflix is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 earnings on Thursday, April 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenue is expected to rise by approximately 12% to around $10.5 billion, while earnings per share are projected to be about $5.73. This growth is anticipated to be fueled by Netflix’s robust subscriber additions throughout 2024—totaling over 40 million—and its recent price increases. In January, the company raised the standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the Premium plan to $25 per month. Netflix posted strong subscriber gains in 2024, driven by its crackdown on password-sharing and the growth of its ad-supported tier. However, this momentum could ease in 2025. Additionally, intensifying competition could contribute to elevated churn or slower growth in new subscriptions. Netflix’s decision to discontinue reporting subscriber figures might indicate that it expects growth to taper off this year. Margins will also be a key focus this quarter. The company’s content expenses are set to climb as it expands further into live sports programming, including NFL games and WWE wrestling, which are typically higher-cost content segments. Netflix currently holds a market capitalization of $404 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company generated $39 billion in revenue, with $10 billion in operating profit and $8.7 billion in net income.
