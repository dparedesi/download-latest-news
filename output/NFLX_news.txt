Title: Watch These Key Netflix Price Levels as Stock Drops After Disappointing Earnings

Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:46:39Z

Netflix (NFLX) shares tumbled in premarket trading Wednesday after the streaming giant 's third-quarter earnings came in short of Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings per share of $5.87, compared with the $6.92 EPS that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had anticipated. Executives said an unplanned charge tied to an "ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities" weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue rose 17% from the year-earlier period to $11.51 billion, in line with analysts' estimates, and Netflix projected another 17% increase in the fourth quarter, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. Netflix shares were down more than 7% at around $1,150 in recent premarket trading. Through yesterday's close, the stock had risen 40% since the start of the year, far outpacing the 15% gain of the benchmark S&P 500 index over the period. Below, we take a closer look at the Netflix chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After hitting their record high in late June, Netflix shares have consolidated within a descending triangle, a bearish chart pattern that signals a potential move lower. Indeed, the stock looks set to tumble toward the pattern’s lower trendline following the streamer’s weaker-than-expected earnings report, reinforcing a downward bias. Let’s point out two key support levels to watch on the Netflix chart amid the possibility for further weakness and also identify overhead areas worth monitoring during future recovery efforts. A decisive volume-backed breakdown below the descending triangle could see the shares initially test a key support level around $1,065. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent February swing high. Further downside could see a more-significant drop to the $942 level. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near last December’s peak, which also closely aligns with a series of corresponding price action on the chart between January and April. It’s worth noting this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a bearish measured move target that calculates the width of the descending triangle near its widest section in points and deducts that amount from the pattern’s lower trendline. Recovery efforts in the stock back toward the descending triangle’s upper trendline could see the shares test the $1,265 area. The price may run into overhead resistance at this level near a trendline that connects peaks on the chart in June and September. Finally, buying above this area could propel a bullish move to around $1,341. Investors who have bought Netflix shares during its consolidation period in recent months may decide to lock in profits around the stock’s all-time high.

Title: Investors Pause To Wait For Magnificent 7 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinebrock/2025/10/22/investors-pause-to-wait-for-magnificent-7-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T12:23:01Z

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors await earnings results from the Magnificent Seven stocks, starting with Tesla (TSLA) after the market closes on Wednesday. The large-cap S&P 500 index and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite were nearly flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%. Tesla is expected to report EPS of $0.56 per share after missing the consensus estimate for three consecutive quarters. The EV maker reported $0.72 per share earnings in last year’s third quarter. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock declined in pre-market trading after the streaming company fell short of expectations on revenue and profit. Netflix’s miss may be a less-common outcome in this earnings season, however. Bloomberg reports that among S&P 500 firms that have already reported earnings, 85% have beat profit expectations. If the trend continues, the third quarter of 2025 may end up being the best earnings quarter since 2021. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are mixed ahead of the market open on Wednesday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 rose almost 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Dow Jones futures declined 0.1%. What is a bubble in investing? In investing, a bubble is a period of rapidly increasing asset prices, usually driven by investor enthusiasm more so than underlying value. Bubbles end when prices reset or “burst.” The run-up in prices and the correction that follows tend to be overreactions to market conditions. To oversimplify, an optimistic trading environment can fuel aggressive buying and a general increase in risk appetite. Investors may stretch outside their normal parameters in terms of valuations and business fundamentals. The immediate outcome is positive—stock prices keep rising, which encourages more buying. At some point, investors begin to take profits from the run-up. This can be prompted by a change in economic conditions, disappointing earnings, or something else. The profit-taking can be as contagious as the aggressive buying. It can quickly shift into loss-aversion and panic if the selloff continues. Long-term investors can protect themselves from bubble-related volatility by sticking to their investment plan. Resisting the urge to follow the masses during the rally is key. A diversified portfolio of quality assets should be resilient enough to withstand the correction or crash that can follow a bubble. Also, the price reset that follows a bubble can be a good time to snap up under-priced shares.
