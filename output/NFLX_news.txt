(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook.

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.
