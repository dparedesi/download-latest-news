Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%.
