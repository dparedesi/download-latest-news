More Groundbreaking Ceremony on May 13, 2025 in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. (Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Netflix) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares have been exceptionally successful this year, climbing approximately 25% since the beginning of January and trading close to $1,100 each. This increase can be attributed to several factors. Netflix’s financial results have been robust, driven by subscriber growth from lower-priced ad-supported plans, enforcement against password sharing, and rising advertising revenues. In Q1 2025, Netflix’s revenues surpassed projections, growing 13% to reach $10.54 billion, while earnings increased by 25% to $6.61 per share. The company has also successfully raised prices without encountering significant pushback from clients. In late January, the cost of its standard plan rose to around $18 monthly, while the premium plan increased to about $25 per month. Thus, does Netflix stock still offer good value? We believe that the stock appears appealing yet volatile, making it a challenging choice to purchase at its current price of approximately $1110. We think there are several reasons for concern regarding NFLX stock, which renders it attractive yet highly susceptible to negative events, given that its current valuation is very high. We reach our conclusion by assessing the current valuation of NFLX stock in relation to its operational performance over the past few years, along with its present and historical financial status. Our evaluation of Netflix based on key metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company demonstrates a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as explained below.
