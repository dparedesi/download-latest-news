We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for High Returns in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. On December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook. To curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database.

Title: Signal: Surging Netflix Stock Could Hit Four Digits, And Soon

Netflix (NFLX) was a big winner on Wall Street this week. The streaming stock gapped 9.7% higher on Jan. 22, in the wake of an outstanding earnings report that saw the company post a top-line beat for the fourth quarter and topple 300 million subscribers. The shares hit a record high of $999 that day, before cooling off and settling at $953.99. The good news for investors betting on NFLX hitting four digits – the stock is flashing a historically bullish signal on the charts. Netflix’s recent high coincides with historically low implied volatility (IV) – a combination that has generated tailwinds in the past. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, there have been eight times over the last five years when the equity was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) also happened to sit in the 20th annual percentile or lower. This is the case with the stock’s current SVI of 25%, which sits in the 6th percentile of its annual range. Netflix stock chart with 80-day moving average Data shows that one month after those signals, the equity boasted a 75% win rate and averaged a 4.7% return over that timeframe. From its current perch of $979.92, a similar move would put NFLX comfortably above $1,000 in the next month. There are additional technical support levels to watch that could make this rally sustainable. Note in the chart above the channel of higher highs carved since August. If the stock can topple the upper rail of this channel, NFLX could be off to the races. The equity could also see chart support step up at its newly-cleared +10% year-to-date level, while its 80-day moving average was an effective springboard earlier this month, also per the chart above. Analysts have been slow to adjust, and bull notes could also keep the wind at the security’s back. There are still 16 brokerages of the 41 in coverage that are on the sidelines with “hold” or “strong sell” ratings, while NFLX’s consensus 12-month price target of $1,047.20 is only a 6.6% premium from its current perch.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President Trump at the World Economic Forum. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped, along with those of Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Investors are still awaiting new developments on the tariff front. Trump is expected to remotely give an address to the WEF in Davos later in the day.
