(Photo by Valeria Mongelli/Anadolu via Getty Images) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is anticipated to announce its Q2 2025 earnings on Thursday, July 17, 2025. According to consensus estimates, revenues are expected to reach approximately $11 billion for the quarter, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous year, while earnings are projected to be $7.06 per share, up from $4.88 during the same period last year. This growth is likely to be driven by recent price hikes and increasing advertising revenue. Earlier this year, Netflix raised the cost of its standard HD plan by $2.50 to $18 per month and increased the price of the Premium plan to $25 per month. The company has also been concentrating on enhancing its advertising technologies, launching its in-house ad tech platform in the U.S. this past April. This initiative could help improve ad capabilities and pricing realizations. Year-over-year revenue comparisons will also benefit from stronger subscriber counts over the last year, partly driven by the crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of the ad-supported tier, even though the impact of these initiatives may start to lessen. We will also monitor Netflix's margins for the quarter closely. This year, Netflix's content costs are expected to increase. While the company has generally focused on scripted entertainment, it is currently branching out into live sports, which may entail higher production and licensing expenses. Netflix has a current market capitalization of $551 billion. Over the last twelve months, revenue totaled $40 billion, with the company being operationally profitable, reporting $11 billion in operating profits and net income of $9.3 billion. Therefore, if you’re looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch.

NFLX 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not beneficial if the correlation is low) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could take a “long” position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. The correlation labeled 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.
