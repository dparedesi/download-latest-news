Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the final day of a trading week that saw the financial headlines dominated by the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. A day after notching an all-time closing high in the wake of the Fed's decision to lower interest rates, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Friday. After wavering for much of the session, the Dow rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of less than 0.1%, eking out its second straight record close. The Nasdaq ended Friday's session 0.4% lower. FedEx (FDX) shares plummeted 15.2%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock, after the package delivery giant reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and trimmed its full-year forecasts. The company cited soft demand trends, especially in U.S. markets. Following the earnings release, analysts at the investment bank Jefferies reduced their price target on FedEx stock. Lennar (LEN) topped sales and profit estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results, but shares of the homebuilder fell 5.4% after it predicted its gross margin on home sales would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Friday's downdraft reversed the gains posted by Lennar stock in the previous session following the Fed's rate-cut announcement. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) also gave back the gains they notched after the Fed's decision, dropping 5.2% on Friday. The less-than-truckload (LTL) freight company is navigating numerous headwinds, with shipment volumes and rates coming under pressure amid soft freight demand, increasing capital expenditures and a shortage of drivers. Electric utility Constellation Energy (CEG) announced plans to restart operations at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide environmentally friendly energy for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. Constellation said it inked a 20-year deal with the software giant to create the Crane Clean Energy Center, generating carbon-free electricity to power Microsoft's data centers on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland power transmission system. Constellation Energy shares soared 22.3% on Friday, notching the top performance in the S&P 500. Constellation's announcement also helped lift shares of other electricity generators, including those of power utility Vistra (VST), which jumped 16.6%. Vistra also announced it will acquire the remaining 15% stake that it does not currently own in its subsidiary Vistra Vision, which includes nuclear, solar, and energy storage assets. Meanwhile, shares of fellow Texas-based power generator NRG Energy (NRG) added 6.4%. Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) gained 8.1% following positive comments from analysts at Citigroup. The cybersecurity firm drew negative attention in July when a faulty update of its security software caused widespread technology outages worldwide. However, analysts applauded transparency from the company's management team following the incident. Citi also pointed to CrowdStrike's success in limiting customer churn and maintaining pricing.

Title: Oracle’s Larry Ellison Is Now the World’s 3rd Richest Person Thanks to the A.I. Boom

Larry Ellison, the founder and chairman of software giant Oracle, is the latest tech entrepreneur to reap the rewards of the A.I. boom. The billionaire is currently the world’s third wealthiest person and briefly surpassed Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos as the second richest person this week (behind Elon Musk). A recent Oracle stock surge has sent Ellison’s net worth soaring to an estimated $203.5 billion. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Fueling Ellison’s good fortune is an unprecedented demand for data centers, which power the A.I. models underpinning products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Oracle beat Wall Street’s expectations earlier this month when it reported a 7 percent year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $13.3 billion, with the company’s cloud services revenue skyrocketing by 21 percent to $5.6 billion. The news has been a booster for Oracle’s share price, which has soared more than 47 percent in the past 12 months and almost doubled since the beginning of 2023. Oracle currently has 162 data centers in operation and under construction globally, Ellison told analysts during a recent earnings call, adding that he expects the company to eventually have 1,000 to 2,000 of these facilities. The company’s largest data center is 800 megawatts and will contain “acres” of Nvidia (NVDA)’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train A.I. models, he said. Nvidia’s GPUs have been in high demand as Big Tech races to deploy A.I. products. During an Oracle financial analyst meeting on Sept. 12, Ellison described a dinner with Elon Musk and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, where the Oracle head and Musk were “begging” Jensen for more A.I. chips. “Please take our money. No, take more of it. You’re not taking enough, we need you to take more of it,” recalled Ellison, who said the strategy worked. Oracle also recently bolstered its database power by partnering up with Amazon’s cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The deal, which will allow customers to access Oracle’s database offerings within AWS, follows a slew of similar cloud partnerships the company has struck with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). “We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” said Ellison during the earnings call. Ellison, 80, co-founded Oracle in 1977 and helmed the company as CEO until 2014. He also recently made headlines for his financial backing of the acquisition of Paramount (PARA) by Skydance, a media company founded by his son David Ellison. He reportedly is set to have an influential role in the takeover as a major shareholder. But for the time being, the billionaire appears to be firmly stationed on A.I.—and he has grand ambitions for the new technology. In addition to generative A.I.’s potential to help spot forest fires and identify agricultural output needs via drones, he lauded the ability of A.I.-enabled cameras to enhance surveillance while speaking at Oracle’s financial analyst meeting. “Citizens will be on their best behavior because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on,” he noted. Police officers, meanwhile, will be supervised at all times, with body cameras prepared to alert the appropriate authorities of any misconduct. “The world is going to be a better place as we exploit these opportunities and take advantage of this great technology,” he added. But who will take advantage first remains up in the air. “There’s really one winner. Someone’s going to be better at this than anyone else, and multiple people are trying,” said Ellison of the A.I. boom, likening the technology arms race to “Formula 1.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BCE is Dead to Me – August Dividend Income Report

The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / September 19, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. This month, I couldn’t help discussing BCE. Let’s start with the numbers as of September 5th 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – August 2024): 150.27% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 83 months): 14.18% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 13.62% (total return 141.80%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 9.27% (total return 84.60%) I’m sorry for the strong title. I had to make it crystal clear and get your attention: I’ve never been a fan of BCE, which I always saw as a deluxe bond: a stock that pays a good yield with a good dividend growth policy, but where I don’t expect much stock price appreciation over time. That’s how BCE compares advantageously to a bond: capital stability with better income growth expectations. So, what do we do when the capital isn’t that stable and the dividend growth policy is reduced from 5% to 3%? We do a deep dive into the financials. I’m often asked by members to bring you all with me on this journey into financial statements. In general, I don’t read financial statements from cover to cover. I only do a deep dive when I have questions that don’t have self evident answers. I’m doing this analysis of BCE to find out what will happen with the dividend in 2025. I have summarized my thoughts in the video below, but strongly encourage you to read the complete article. So, let’s start the journey with the elephant in the room… Telcos are capital-intensive. It means they must spend considerable amounts of money to maintain and improve their networks. They will go through periods where they borrow more money than they generate because those investments will generate profit in the future. That’s like obtaining a large mortgage in your 20s with the anticipation that you will increase your salary over time. You take the loan now, and you bank on your ability to generate stronger cash flow in the future. Let’s take a look at what the long-term debt looks like in BCE’s 2023 annual statement first: This chart tells us two things. What the chart doesn’t tell us is what is going on this year so far (we have 2 more quarters to know where this story is going). Let’s take a look at the most recent numbers. I’ll start by looking at the total long-term debt trend for the past 10 years to see where we were, and where we are going. As you can see, we are not going in the right direction. Since 2017, BCE has been on a streak of securing more and more debt. As I’ve discussed this topic before, the point was to obtain inexpensive debt and invest massively in BCE’s network. The good old adage of “you need to spend money to make money”. That’s true… until it isn’t. It all depends on the cost of your debt and the quality of your investments. We will initially focus on the cost of the debt, and we will discuss the results of those investments (cash flow generation) later on. I’ve pulled the latest quarterly update for BCE’s debt. My focus on the next chart is how much of that debt will come to maturity in the next 12 months. It is true that interest rates are a bit lower now than they were 6 months ago. However, Moody’s (a credit rating agency) recently downgraded BCE to one notch above the level of junk bonds (to Baa3 from Baa2). This will not help BCE secure better borrowing rates in the coming months. I’d like to draw your attention to the amount of debt up for renewal in the next 12 months (between June 30th 2024 and June 30th 2025). That’s 17% of BCE’s debt that will cost more than it was before. Speaking of interest charges, it’s also out of control. From its latest quarterly earnings report, BCE shows interest expense up by 19% Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 and up 20% ytd 2024 vs ytd 2023. So, over the past 12 months, the interest expenses increased by roughly 20%. I was curious to know which portio... (truncated)
