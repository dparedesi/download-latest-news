ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver. There are three Seattle-based companies that are worth buying now: Nordstrom (ticker JWN), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK), all of which offer attractive long-term returns. Nordstrom represents one of Seattle's most iconic retail success stories. Founded in 1901, this luxury department store chain has built a reputation for exceptional customer service and premium merchandise. After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division. The company's most recent quarterly earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, with stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and improved margins. Nordstrom reports earnings on June 6th, so stay tuned to hear more about their turnaround plans. Despite the challenging retail environment created by the current administration's ADHD governance style which has whipsawed markets, Nordstrom remains on track to hit its 2025 guidance—no easy task in today's unpredictable economic landscape. The company's loyal, high-income customer base provides resilience during economic uncertainty. Nordstrom's digital investments are paying dividends with robust online growth, while its brick-and-mortar footprint remains strategically valuable in prime locations. The stock currently trades at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, suggesting significant upside potential as discretionary spending rebounds. Nordstrom's management team has demonstrated discipline in inventory management and cost controls while maintaining the premium shopping experience that differentiates the brand. Their focus on exclusive merchandise partnerships and personalized styling services creates competitive advantages that pure e-commerce players struggle to replicate. Seattle's global coffee empire is positioned for renewed growth after recent operational challenges. Starbucks' unmatched brand loyalty and extensive retail network of over 38,000 stores worldwide provide enormous competitive advantages. The company's strategic initiatives under new leadership are addressing operational inefficiencies while expanding digital capabilities and strengthening customer connections. Starbucks delivered a standout quarterly performance that surpassed analyst expectations across key metrics, including comparable store sales and operating margins. The company has projected $0.67 per share in the third quarter versus $0.41 per share in the second quarter. Despite navigating supply chain disruptions and consumer spending fluctuations caused by the administration's erratic policy shifts that have whipsawed markets, the company confidently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance—demonstrating remarkable operational discipline in an unpredictable environment. Starbucks continues to see strong international growth, particularly in China where the company is expanding its footprint despite near-term economic headwinds. The brand's ongoing menu innovation and premium positioning allow it to maintain pricing power even in inflationary environments. The company's rewards program boasts over 30 million active members in the U.S. alone, driving repeat business and higher average tickets. Recent stock price weakness presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, with the company's robust free cash flow supporting both dividend growth and share repurchases. Starbucks' dividend yield currently exceeds historical averages, providing income while investors wait for the growth initiatives to fully materialize. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 04: An Alaska Airlines plane takes off from Los Angeles ... More International Airport (LAX) on December 4, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Alaska Airlines has announced it plans to purchase rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal which must be approved by federal regulators. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) This Seattle-based airline has built a reputation for operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Alaska Air Group has successfully integrated Virgin America while expanding its routes and partnerships to create a more competitive national network. The carrier's strong presence along the West Coast positions it ideally to benefit from the region's economic dynamism and population growth. Alaska Air's quarterly results flew past expectations with impressive load factors and revenue per available seat mile, despite the turbulence created by volatile fuel prices and changing travel regulations. Alaska expects to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter on $3.5 billion in revenue, up from $3.2 billion in the second quarter. The airline has skillfully navigated the unpredictable policy environment—characterized by the current administration's ADHD governance style that has whipsawed markets—and remains firmly on course to achieve its ambitious 2025 financial and operational targets. Alaska's fleet modernization program is improving fuel efficiency and reducing maintenance costs, strengthening its cost structure compared to legacy carriers. The company maintains one of the industry's strongest balance sheets with relatively low debt levels, providing financial flexibility to weather industry cyclicality and invest in growth opportunities. The airline's loyalty program and credit card partnerships generate high-margin revenue streams that complement its core operations. Alaska's management team has demonstrated disciplined capacity growth and pricing strategies that prioritize profitability over market share. Recent expansion into premium cabin offerings addresses higher-yield business travelers while maintaining its value proposition for leisure customers. SEATTLE, WA - (Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images ) These three companies exemplify the broader economic strengths of Washington state. While federal finances deteriorate, Seattle-based enterprises benefit from the state's fiscal discipline, educated workforce, and innovation ecosystem. Investors seeking refuge from national economic challenges would be wise to consider these Washington state stalwarts for their portfolios. Their combination of established market positions, turnaround potential, and exposure to the dynamic Pacific Northwest economy offers compelling long-term value.
