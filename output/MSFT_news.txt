The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. While the others — Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late — and quietly. The last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company’s attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. Technology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn’t had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI “companions” that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone’s dominance. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. Read more: Apple’s brutal year keeps getting worse Apple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg’s company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration’s 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026. Apple’s first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple’s crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it’s not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple’s App Store looms large. Wall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth. China has been central to Apple’s strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China’s smartphone market. And Apple can’t even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company’s ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China’s generative AI rules. The company’s struggles in China don’t even take into account the swirling — and massive — economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. On Apple’s last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump’s tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact. Apple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China — pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. But Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump’s Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. Announcements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud — and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy. Yes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn’t been enough. Right now, Apple isn’t losing. It’s just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse.

Title: Bond Yields & Stocks: Something’s Happening Here

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The recent sharp rise in US Treasury bond yields has raised questions about whether the move is ... More connected to US fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism. The evidence for alternate explanations is examined. Despite some pundits being quite convinced that U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the reason for the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, Buffalo Springfield was closer to reality when they sang, “Something’s happening here, What it is ain’t exactly clear.” It is not disputed that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are 52 basis points (0.52%) higher since the 2025 low of 3.99% on April 4. Using U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities data, expected higher inflation accounted for 15 basis points, while the remaining 37 are from a higher real (after-inflation) return. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Notably, yields were at their nadir when the betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, yields have risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Directionally, the move in yields is logical, though some might still argue that yields have increased more than is warranted. Yields & Recession Odds Government bond yields in the U.S. have risen more than many other developed countries since April 4. Interestingly, our neighbor to the north has experienced a similar increase. 10-Year Government Bond Yield Change Since US Low Notably, global government bond yields hit their low during the pandemic and have trended higher since then. Global Yields If one looks at government yields since the end of last year, a different picture emerges. While higher government bond yields have been a global phenomenon, the U.S. has seen slightly lower yields. 10-Year Government Bond Year-To-Date Yield Change The other proof point for those arguing for the danger of U.S. fiscal policy or the end of American exceptionalism is the recent weakness in the U.S. currency relative to other currencies. While there is no doubt that the U.S. dollar has been weaker year-to-date, it follows a period of exceptional relative strength. The U.S. dollar remains stronger than it has been most of the time since 1999. Further, as shown in the historical data, periods of a weaker U.S. dollar do not uniformly lead to higher U.S. Treasury bond yields. US Dollar Without exception, the fiscal position of large countries, as measured by government debt relative to GDP, deteriorated with the impact of spending during the pandemic. Most countries were already piling on more debt relative to economic activity, but the pandemic accelerated the trend. Government Debt-To-GDP There is no magic level of debt-to-GDP that signals disaster since countries with a more resilient economy can service more debt. Furthermore, countries like the US, which has a high per capita GDP, control of the global reserve currency, and only issues debt in that currency, can handle significantly more debt levels than most other countries. German government debt levels are understated relative to reality. While Germany isn’t legally liable for the debts of its profligately spending neighbors, it shares a common currency and its share of European Union issued debt. Historically, Germany has been forced to contribute the most to bailout funds when other EU countries have encountered problems. Recent Government Debt-To-GDP Ratios The U.S. House of Representatives passed its tax legislation, which, despite reports to the contrary, does not make the U.S. fiscal situation any worse, according to Strategas. Tariffs should produce about $200 billion in revenue annually and are not included in the legislation’s official scoring, leading to much confusion. The U.S. Senate will almost certainly make some changes. So, the House bill is unlikely to be the final version implemented. The S&P 500 sits only 5.6% below its mid-February high in a robust rebound from the 19% decline from the peak reached on April 8. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 12% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The proximate cause of the decline in stocks last week was the reheating of the tariff war, which increased the headwinds for the U.S. and global economy. President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff and smartphone makers, notably Apple (AAPL), with a 25% tariff rate. The betting odds of recession rose to 41%, sending stocks 2.6% lower last week. Betting Odds of 2025 US Recession Despite the likely economic drag from the tariffs, only two expected rate cuts for 2025 are expected. There is little chance of a rate cut at the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Friday’s April inflation reading will likely be friendly. The Core PCE Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation and should moderate to 2.5% year-over-year from the 2.6% pace in March. The last Magnificent 7 stock to report earnings is Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday after the close. As the leader in artificial intelligence chips, its results and forecasts will be closely watched to judge the health of technology spending. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields does not point to a U.S.-specific problem; instead, it is a function of the lower probability of an economic downturn and perhaps a shift in the global appetite for government bonds. Yields are not high enough yet to significantly negatively impact stock valuation since the higher yields are accompanied by less risk of an earnings decline from a recession. Like many other countries, the current fiscal trajectory in the U.S. is unsustainable, but the recent tax bill wouldn’t worsen things. Investors can be forgiven for wishing it improved the path, but the Senate will have their say next, and bond market participants will be watching closely. Government bond investors are demanding higher yields from most countries, so there might be a shift in the willingness of markets to fund large deficits, but it is too early to know for sure.
