Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/26/sp-500-surges-magnificent-7-earnings-rate-cut-and-ai-boom-drive-q3/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Title: Wall Street Is Worried About an AI Bubble—Here's the Sector Where Stock Prices Really Stand Out
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/wall-street-is-worried-about-an-ai-bubble-the-sector-where-stock-prices-really-stand-out-11835209
Time Published: 2025-10-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
AI boom or AI bubble? That's been one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street of late. Some investors see echoes of the Dotcom Bubble in Nvidia's (NVDA) and OpenAI's recent circular dealmaking bonanza and soaring stock prices. Others note the AI boom is being financed by hugely profitable tech companies, whose valuations aren't nearly as high as their Dotcom peers. As Big Tech's AI spending has ballooned, so have the ranks of companies claiming a piece of the pie. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales of unsexy, slow-and-steady businesses and transformed their stocks into buzzy growth names. It has also juiced the stocks of nascent companies that are years from self-sufficiency, creating pockets of exceptional froth within a pricey AI ecosystem. The stocks that gain the most during sharp market rallies are often the stocks that, when sentiment turns negative, have the farthest to fall. That is especially true of young companies that, without substantial sales, rely on debt and equity markets to fund their growth. To understand where the AI trade has become most bubbly, Investopedia identified 75 companies regularly referred to as "AI beneficiaries" by Wall Street analysts, and sorted each into one of five categories: cloud computing providers; semiconductor makers; software companies; power providers; and networking, storage, and cooling equipment makers. A few companies, like Microsoft (MSFT), fit in multiple categories, in which case we've placed them in the one that feels most central to their AI business today. At present, Microsoft's cloud revenue is the best metric for assessing its AI business, so it's classified as a cloud provider instead of a software company. All five categories have seen their valuations rise over the past few years, but none more than power providers. The median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of our power basket in 2025 is 4.53, nearly three times the median in 2023 (1.52). The next largest P/S expansions over that period were in networking, storage and cooling (4.45 in 2025 vs. 2.09 in 2023) and cloud providers (10.5 vs 6.34). (Cloud providers have a higher P/S ratio in absolute terms because the category is composed of tech stocks that have historically commanded higher valuations. This is why we've compared change over the past three years rather than absolute P/S ratios.) Power also has more unprofitable companies than any other category—so many in fact that we’re using price-to-sales as our benchmark valuation metric rather than the more common price-to-earnings ratio. Five of the 14 companies in our power basket are expected to report a loss this calendar year. No other category has more than one unprofitable company. The race to build the data centers that train and run AI models has set off an equally frenzied race to generate and transmit the vast amounts of electricity those data centers consume. Nuclear energy has attracted interest from tech companies for its efficiency and small carbon footprint. Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) have all signed multi-billion dollar deals with nuclear power plant operators like Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST), both of which have seen their stocks surge over the past two years. But in their rush to bring reliable sources of electricity online, tech companies and investors have also thrown money at nuclear tech upstarts, some without operational generators or regulatory approvals. Shares of small modular reactor maker NuScale Power (SMR) doubled in value between January and mid-October. At the stock’s peak earlier this month, the company, which reported $37 million in revenue last year and isn’t expected to be profitable until 2029, was valued at more than $15 billion. Meanwhile, nuclear tech startup Oklo’s (OKLO) market capitalization peaked at $25.7 billion earlier this month, a 720% increase from the start of the year. Oklo is the only company of the 75 we’ve included in our analysis that is expected to report no revenue this year. Analysts forecast it will turn a profit for the first time in 2030. Though it’s not just nuclear businesses that have achieved rich valuations. Fermi (FRMI), the developer of a massive AI data center campus in the Texas Panhandle, was founded in January and went public in early October at a valuation of more than $19 billion. Fermi plans to build 11 gigawatts of computing capacity powered by on-site nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar generators. It expects to break ground on its first data center in March, and hopes to have about 1 GW of capacity online by the end of 2026. AI power stocks just finished a volatile week that may underscore the extent to which their prices are driven by fickle sentiment. Constellation Energy and Vistra both shed more than 10% of their value in the first half of the week, as did GE Vernova (GEV), whose turbines are in high demand from data center clients seeking to draw on the South’s ample supply of natural gas. All three finished the week little changed. The upstarts were hit even harder. NuScale, Oklo, and Fermi all lost more than 25% of their value between Monday's open and midday Wednesday. But they too rebounded, finishing the week with losses in the low- to mid-teens.
