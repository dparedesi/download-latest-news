We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/12/how-interest-rates-will-impact-this-7-closed-end-fund/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T11:00:00Z

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T20:03:53Z

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/delisting-a-stock-from-the-s-and-p-500-8721818
Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z
Full Content:
Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled its next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its Advancing AI event on Thursday, though shares fell after the announcements, with analysts suggesting investors may have been looking for more from the chipmaker. AMD announced its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, which CEO Lisa Su said delivers dramatically more power than its predecessor, and new Ryzen AI PRO processors for enterprise AI. The company also showed off its latest Instinct MI300X series GPU, the MI325X, with production set begin in the fourth quarter and availability for AMD's partners in the first quarter of 2025. The new products come as demand for AI chips grows, and could help AMD expand its market share. AMD said its market share for its EPYC server processors hit a new high of 34% at the end of the second quarter, and could continue to climb with its next generation of products. Analysts suggested ahead of the event that it could be a "catch-up" catalyst for AMD to expand its slice of the market, after a strong start to the year with data center sales hitting a record high in the second quarter. Su also highlighted the chipmaker's partnerships with Oracle (ORCL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) at the event. Kevin Salvadori, Meta’s VP for infrastructure and engineering, said that the company’s work on generative AI has made use of more than 1.5 million of AMD's EPYC CPUs and utilized Instinct GPUs for projects such as developing its Llama large language model. Oracle SVP Karan Batta added that AMD's Instinct GPUs have delivered strong performance for the company, and Google Cloud VP Amin Vahdat called the demand for AI computing power "insatiable." The event did little to benefit AMD's stock price, however. Shares fell 4% Thursday to close at $164.18. Jefferies and Wedbush analysts suggested investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with Nvidia (NVDA), an outlook boost, or new customer announcement. UPDATE—Oct. 10, 2024: This article has been updated to include additional comments from analysts and reflect more recent share price information.

Title: Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-microsoft-oppenheimer-chooses-100026830.html
Time Published: 2024-10-10T10:00:26Z

The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible. But the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements. In addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path. For Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.” These comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here) Overall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast) Microsoft Corporation Now on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company. Like Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages. Microsoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped. The company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google. AI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users. Building out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast. The company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for. 5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.” Horan follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) While the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Oracle Price Levels to Watch as Stock Sets Record High
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/oracle-price-levels-to-watch-as-stock-sets-record-high-8726067
Time Published: 2024-10-10T02:49:30Z
Full Content:
Oracle (ORCL) shares hit a record high Wednesday following a report that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is looking beyond Microsoft (MSFT) to supply servers, paving the way for a potential new partnership with the enterprise software giant. Tech industry focused publication The Information reported that OpenAI’s leadership recently told staff that the company planned to take on a larger role in securing data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) chips, rather than relying exclusively on Microsoft. In June, the company rented Oracle servers at a new data center in Texas with limited input from Microsoft, according to the report. At the time, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman said that the software company’s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) would allow it to scale, while Oracle CEO Larry Ellison pointed out that AI leaders such as OpenAI are turning to the company for its fast, cost-effective AI infrastructure. Oracle shares have surged around 25% in the past month and gained nearly 70% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close, boosted in part by a recent multicloud partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud business. The stock rose 2.3% to close Wednesday's session at $178.29, after hitting an all-time high of $178.61. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle's weekly chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. Oracle shares traded within a three-year rising wedge before staging a decisive volume-backed breakout above the pattern last month. Since that time, the stock has continued to trend sharply higher, though share turnover has decreased following the initial breakout. While, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also cautions of short-term overbought conditions with a reading above 80. It’s worth pointing out that the last time the indicator flashed above this threshold in June last year, the stock underwent a correction of around 22% over the following six months. We’ll now identify three important lower chart area that could come into play during pullbacks and use a bars pattern to project a price target if the stock continues its long-term uptrend. The first location to monitor sits around $146, an area on the chart where the shares could find initial support around the July swing high and wedge pattern’s top trendline. Selling below this level could see the shares revisit the $127 level, a region just below the wedge’s lower trendline that would likely encounter support from multiple highs on the chart between June 2023 and May this year, which also closely aligns with the 2024 August low and upward sloping 50-week moving average (MA). A deeper correction could bring the psychological $100 round number into play. Investors would likely look for buying opportunities in this area near the closely-watched 200-week MA and prominent peaks and troughs that formed on the chart from October 2021 to December last year. A bars pattern uses historical trends to predict future moves. To apply this technique on Oracle’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from October 2022 to June last year and overlay it from the August low, which projects a price target of around $250. We selected this earlier trending period because it began from the rising wedge’s lower trendline, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. Interestingly, the prior trend played out over 36 weeks, meaning a comparable move could potentially last until early April if price history were to rhyme.

Title: MicroStrategy Is a Strategic Buy to Capitalize on Bitcoin’s Outperformance
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-strategic-buy-capitalize-bitcoin-174706028.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:47:06Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a tech company that has spent the last few years accumulating Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet through a well-executed financing strategy. This approach supports my bullish stance on the company, particularly in a rising crypto market. MSTR has outperformed Bitcoin, highlighting the advantages of holding the company’s stock over directly investing in the cryptocurrency. By investing in MSTR, investors can amplify Bitcoin’s potential returns through a regulated stock, making it a more accessible option for institutional investors compared to holding cryptocurrency directly. Specifically, this year, MSTR shares have benefited from their high correlation with Bitcoin’s price swings, rallying over 211%. Recently, the shares saw an increase in momentum following the Fed’s interest rate cut. The last time this occurred, Bitcoin’s price more than doubled. In this article, I will delve into the strategy behind MicroStrategy’s business and explain why buying at current levels may be a wise decision. Before delving further into the bullish thesis, it’s essential to provide some context. MicroStrategy is (or was) primarily a data software company that helps customers make informed decisions by analyzing large sets of data from multiple sources. However, facing strong competition from powerful players like Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM), its core business has struggled to grow. About four years ago, the company pivoted to make aggressive investments in Bitcoin, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor, a staunch advocate of cryptocurrency. According to MicroStrategy’s shareholder letter released last year, the company holds an unwavering confidence in Bitcoin for the long term. The management team stated, “Because of its characteristics, we believe Bitcoin is a superior store of value, akin to digital gold or digital property. Just as records and CDs gave way to digital music, we believe gold and other traditional physical stores of value will give way to Bitcoin.” Currently, about 38% of MicroStrategy’s market cap corresponds to its Bitcoin holdings. By the end of July, MicroStrategy owned 226,500 Bitcoins, purchased at a total cost of $8.3 billion, and now valued at about $14.3 billion. The main bullish argument for MicroStrategy centers on its clever strategy of expanding its balance sheet through Bitcoin acquisitions. Since 2020, CEO Michael Saylor has focused on growing MicroStrategy’s value by buying Bitcoin with debt, particularly through convertible bonds, and capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s high volatility. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the company is able to borrow even more money and add to its crypto holdings. At the same time, the company generates revenue from its software business, which amounted to $111 million in Q2, the most recent quarter. However, this represents a slowdown compared to the $120 million generated during the same period last year. As a result, over the past five years, MicroStrategy’s shares have appreciated by nearly 1,200%, closely mirroring fluctuations in Bitcoin prices. However, the journey has not always been smooth. A few years ago, high inflation and rising interest rates made it more expensive for the company to issue new debt or rollover existing obligations. During the crypto winter, from early 2021 to early 2023, MSTR shares plummeted by as much as 86%, falling to less than $15 per share. Today, however, shares have rebounded and exceed $185. My Buy stance on MicroStrategy extends to the belief that purchasing MicroStrategy stock may be more advantageous than buying the cryptocurrency or investing in a BTC fund. At first glance, it may seem illogical to pay a premium on MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin, which currently exceeds 2.3x. This premium reflects how much more or less the market values the company’s stock compared to its Bitcoin holdings alone, especially when you could simply buy the cryptocurrency directly. However, MicroStrategy’s primary advantage lies in its ability to capitalize on and acquire more Bitcoin. So far this year, the company issued two convertible debt offerings at less than 1% in March, scaled up its convertible note offering in June, and conducted another offering more recently in September, using the proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin. This ability to raise capital is one of the main justifications cited by Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who notes that the company has timed the market extraordinarily well. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin since it began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY), NASDAQ (QQQ), gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and major tech stocks. Palmer concludes that, particularly in a bull market, the premium on MicroStrategy shares is justified, and I tend to agree. The Wall Street consensus on MSTR stock is exceptionally optimistic. All eight analysts covering the stock recommend buying it, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target is $202.25, indicating a potential upside of 2.93% based on the latest share price. In summary, I believe that during crypto bull markets, investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should consider a position in MicroStrategy. This approach makes sense because MicroStrategy’s use of debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings has been effectively executed, potentially leading to outperformance relative to both the market and the currency itself. Therefore, I view MicroStrategy as a Buy. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with strong volatility, as fluctuating Bitcoin prices can quickly alter the short- to medium-term outlook.

Title: Microsoft Corp (MSFT): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years

We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows. Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Pixabay/Public Domain Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.
