Permuto Capital management team In perhaps one of the very first instances of blockchain solving a real-world problem, and a little financial alchemy through the creation of additional value through the transformation of a standard financial asset, Permuto Capital has created the next big thing for equity investors. Permuto Capital is launching a product to unbundle the dividend and capital components of common stock and by appealing to different investor groups the sum value of the two elements may be greater than the value of the underlying stock. Permuto filed a registration statement with the SEC, and upon approval, expects to launch with Microsoft (MSFT) as their first equity. Separation of the economic components of financial instruments is not in itself a new idea. In the 1980s the government permitted coupon stripping of U.S. Treasury securities (notes and bonds), a process where the interest and principal components are partitioned into discrete securities and are termed “STRIPS” (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). The components appeal to different segments of investors, and the product thereby improves the efficiency of the overall market. Similar in concept to Treasury stripping, the Permuto product cleaves a Microsoft common share into two: a “dividend certificate” and an “appreciation certificate.” The owner of the dividend certificate will be entitled to the dividends paid by Microsoft on the common share, and the appreciation certificate will represent entitlement to everything else. The “secret sauce” for Permuto that makes their product viable whereas previous incarnations were considered too cumbersome and expensive for widespread distribution is twofold: the advantages of blockchain technology coupled with the use of single stock voting trusts to hold the shares and issue the certificates. The Voting Trust structure provides a regulatory compliant structure, and the blockchain reduces costs. The idea is that investors that hold Microsoft common shares may deposit the shares with a designated custodian, and in return the investor receives one of each of the two certificates. Once the certificates are created, they will trade independently, and hence the investor that deposited the shares may sell one, or both, of the certificates, and other investors may purchase certificates without having owned the underlying shares. An investor who owns both types of certificates may return them to the trust and receive back a common share. For an investor who wishes to use traditional platforms Permuto is seeking to have both types of certificates listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange, and the investor may elect for the Depository Trust Company (DTC) to hold their certificates. Alternatively, investors may choose to hold their certificates on the Chia blockchain as Chia Asset Tokens (CATs). One advantage of the CATs is that they will be able to be traded on decentralized marketplaces 24 hours a day, every day, and not be subject to exchange trading halts. The key advantage of the blockchain technology is cost savings. In addition to the reduction in trading fees from decentralized marketplaces when compared to traditional stock exchanges, the blockchain provides a cost-efficient mechanism for distribution of the dividend payments. Permuto charges for the processing of dividend payments, and there is a nominal fee for the creation or redemption of the certificates. When dividend certificates are held at the DTC Permuto pays the investor 80% of the dividend and retains 20% for processing costs. Better yet, given that costs are significantly lower on the Chia blockchain, an investor holding a CAT will receive 90% of the dividend payments. This difference implies that the dividend certificate should trade for a higher price as a CAT than on the traditional markets. If the assumptions are simplified a quick valuation may be calculated. Using a Microsoft share price of $429 and an annual dividend of $3.32, and assuming that the dividend increases 5% per year of which 90% is returned to the investor, the investor in the dividend certificate will receive $198.50 over thirty years. That is not the price that investor will pay today, however, as money has a greater value today than if received some point in the future. By assuming that money is worth 8% less per year, that dividend certificate will have a value of $45.46. A dividend certificate with that value returns an annual yield of 6.6%. The appreciation certificate should therefore have the value of $429 - $45.46 = $383.23. This simple calculation demonstrates how an investor may value the two elements of the common share. The benefit to investors is that they may allocate their investment capital directly according to their investment preferences, and may receive a string of dividend payments or no dividend payments and only the capital appreciation of the shares. According to Trent Martensen, Co-CEO Permuto Capital, “The ability to choose and manipulate risk exposure assuming a given return requirement is an objective for all investors, and by partitioning common shares into dividends and capital appreciation we are providing investors tools to fine tune their portfolios.” In finance grad school in the late 1980s and early 1990s discussions about financial engineering and structuring of risks often included dividends and how a given dividend stream may not be well priced for a given common stock. Only now are the tools available to deliver standardized products to investors, and Permuto certificates could be the answer to those questions from long ago. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW): Driving Enterprise Workflow Automation and AI Revenue Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. With President Donald Trump having returned to power, one of the first things he has done is revoke a 2023 executive order signed by Joe Biden seeking to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence posed to consumers, workers, and national security. The revoke marks a significant shift in federal oversight of artificial intelligence technology. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street and 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings According to Biden’s orders, developers of AI systems posing risks in any way to the US government, the economy, or even public health or safety, needed to share the results of safety tests with the government, which was in line with the Defense Production Act. The order also required agencies to create orders for testing and address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. As of now, all key safety and transparency requirements for AI developers have been revoked. While it is currently unclear how the Trump administration will handle rules and regulations regarding AI, it is likely to be more of a “hands-off” approach. Regardless of how it is handled, the one clear thing is that this technology will continue to be extremely transformative. As quoted by CEO of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world has yet to completely recognize the extent of change AI will bring to every aspect of human life. “In terms of the risks … this is a technology that no one today really appreciates, truly the level of disruption that it’s going to create, affecting everything from our lives, our businesses, human capital, employment, and every sector is going to be disrupted. And I think that while there’s a lot of opportunity, it also presents significant amount of risk, which is today unclear, because the technology is moving so fast and we’re all trying to catch up as much as possible”. Al Mubarak is also optimistic about the future of AI and the UAE’s ability to leverage its investment strategy. “The demand is going to be profoundly high in terms of the enablement of that technology. That means “the technology, the AI enablement, which is the infrastructure side of it — be it energy, be it transmission, but also all forms of technology, of energy technology that’s going to help fuel this huge demand, I would also add to that data center build-out, chip build-out.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78 ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), a cloud-based, AI-driven platform, enables enterprises to automate multiple management workflows. On January 21, BofA analyst Brad Sills raised the firm’s price target on ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) to $1,280 from $1,075 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst noted that after talking to key ServiceNow partners, he has found deal activity in Q4 to be “solidly in-line or slightly better” which is “a slight improvement” from Q3. The analyst further argued that ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is “second only to Microsoft (MSFT) with tangible AI revenue”. The company has been leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, AI, to help customers streamline workflows and processes across various functions. BofA is very optimistic about the company’s top-line growth and share gains. Overall, NOW ranks 3rd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Here is how high Bitcoin's price can go in 2025, according to a wealth advisor

Christopher McMahon, CEO of Aquinas Wealth Advisors and author of “Faithful Finances”, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Bank of America’s CEO said that they’ll jump into crypto payments if regulators allow it. Do you think with Trump’s executive orders and the new administration things will be better for Bitcoin investors going forward? CHRISTOPHER MCMAHON (CM): I think that’s a great question. I don’t think we’ve ever seen a more favorable environment for crypto. Bitcoin got up to $109,000 the other day. I think today it’s still $103,000. We actually see it just from this momentum, the president endorsing it, the new head of the SEC coming in as a kind of a crypto guy, we see the thing to be $130,000. There is still a lot that’s unproven. The Bank of America (BAC) chairman was right out and saying if some rules change… Something we have to remember about crypto, which I think we forget about, we get so excited. Two of the biggest guys in the history of crypto are both in jail right now, so even though we have some ETFs that people can buy or they can go directly and so they can feel a little bit safer, it’s still the Wild West. And I think the B of A guy was right on when he said, look, if we get some regulation, this could come to Main Street. It’s not on Main Street yet, but I think it’s coming. And for investors, I think it’s a tremendous opportunity. And I think everybody’s portfolio should have some exposure to crypto. I think when folks say, ah, that’s, you know, that’s no good. Right? That’s bad because I’m not familiar with it, I think they’re really doing their portfolio a disservice. Not a huge allocation, but even a balanced portfolio, maybe 3% or 4%, maybe up to 10% if you’re feeling aggressive. AM: Okay. So it’s still largely speculative, but you see $130,000 as a potential price target. Is there a timeline that you believe will happen? CM: We think before the end of the year because the president and his wife both had meme coins drop yesterday, didn’t they? Which is amazing. And I think this environment is so positive for crypto that we have to understand that people who weren’t investing in crypto yesterday are talking about it today and there’s going to be more people buying it, and some of those large crypto ETFs. And the funds really haven’t penetrated the market as much because the brokers don’t believe it. The financial advisors didn’t believe it. Now the financial advisors are actually getting the memo. They’re going to offer it to their clients and we’re gonna start to see that available. I think we’ll actually start to see it available in some retirement funds in the next couple of years, large 401Ks, which will be a complete gamechanger. AM: Do you see any risks or challenges this year with Bitcoin? CM: Yeah, there’s enormous risk with Bitcoin. [Because] if today someone said, Why is it worth $103,000? I would say that’s based on wild optimism because no one uses Bitcoin to conduct business today. Criminals use Bitcoin to conduct business today. That’s the reality of it. Some very avant-garde early adopters are using it, but most people aren’t using it yet. Have you seen those bank machines, the crypto machines in the convenience stores? I was in a store the other day and I said to the woman, “I’m sorry, has anyone ever used this machine?” And she said, “It’s been here for six months, I’ve never seen anybody use it.” Then she said, “No, wait. Someone actually put their drink on it about three days ago.” So I thought, the person who put all these machines out there really spent a fortune on them, but I think it’s gonna have to be a buy and hold. I think we’re going to have to be ready for extreme volatility because I think we’ll see $130,000, as I said, but I think we’ll also see $70,000 again in the next year or so. So be up and down. AM: Okay. $70,000, as well. CM: Yeah, it’s not gonna be a straight line at all. AM: Okay, gotcha. Which happens first? CM: I think the $130,000 happens first because we’re on the top of that wave, I think where we are right now. AM: Okay. So you said 3-5% is a decent allocation for speculating on Bitcoin. What about the other 95-97% of our portfolio right now? Should people load into Mag Seven again in 2025 or diversify away? CM: That’s a great question and if we own some of those tech stocks now, this Mag Seven, I think we should hold most of them because we’ve been rewarded for Tesla (TSLA) lately. It’s been unbelievable. But I think if you take the Mag Seven the last few years, take the Mag Seven out of the S&P 500, it’s only been averaging about under 8% a year. That means as this market starts to broaden out, there’s enormous opportunities in traditional industries, right? Consumer cyclicals is a huge place. There can be energy. We very much like banking. We like it quite a bit. So we wouldn’t double down on the Magnificent Seven right now. AM: If we’re holding Mag Seven in 2025, then what picks do you have for retail investors? CM: A couple that we like very much are Constellation Energy (CEG). We love it. And it’s simple because it’s a broadbased energy company. We like energy as a whole, and a lot of the larger funds are holding Constellation Energy. Interestingly, they dipped their toe in both pools because they signed a large deal with Microsoft (MSFT) recently to supply energy for for all the AI data centers. That means that they are guaranteed about a 30% runup in their stock over the next 12 months, in our opinion. So we like Constellation Energy quite a bit. Well, there’s a mining company we were talking about earlier, Newmark Mining. We love them. They’re doing copper, they’re doing gold. They’re one of the largest gold and copper miners in the world. Gold is a hedge against inflation, of course. We’re not really worried about the inflation play right now. What we’re really thinking about is the uses of gold and copper and manufacturing. AM: And you mentioned financial services, too. What picks do you have? CM: We like American Express (AXP) quite a bit. We like MasterCard (MA), not as much as we like American Express. And generally we don’t like the regional banks. The regional banks are scaring us a little bit. And here’s why. There’s about a trillion dollars of commercial leases that are coming due. Interest rates haven’t been cut enough yet and unfortunately we have some concerns. Our rush hour traffic’s lower because people just aren’t coming into town as much. Even though we are forcing companies to come back downtown. We see some of these buildings refinancing at higher rates with lower occupancy as a potential real headwind. You know, that’s a term we use, ‘headwind’. We don’t want to say potential crash, but a ‘headwind’ for the market. Unlikely that that would bring the market down and stop all this momentum. Therefore, we like the big banks, the big banks are continuing to get bigger. And we think most of the big banks that we’re used to are undervalued by about 10-12% this year. Why take on undue risk when you have that kind of runup in a very predictable stock. AM: Fascinating. So in your book, there are a lot of tips on how people can invest based on their values. What’s one thing you could tell our audience today? CM: I would say be informed. I think your audience knows how to use the internet as well as anybody does, use these tools that are out there now. I would say technology is the king and demand of your advisors, if this is important to me, I need you to prove to me how you’re vetting this appropriately.
