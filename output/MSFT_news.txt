(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $460?

More Deutschland GmbH headquarters building in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on May 23, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has experienced a notable increase of 16% over the last month, surpassing the S&P 500’s 6% rise. This growth is primarily attributed to Microsoft’s impressive Q1 earnings exceeding expectations and a positive outlook, bolstered by its dominance in cloud computing and AI, especially with significant Azure growth. However, following its recent ascent, is MSFT stock still worth buying? Yes, we believe that MSFT stock, which is currently priced around $460, offers an appealing buying opportunity. Though its present valuation is elevated compared to the benchmark index, making it susceptible to negative events, we do not see any significant reasons for concern. Our assessment stems from a thorough evaluation of Microsoft’s present valuation relative to its historical operational performance and financial condition. We have examined Microsoft against key criteria: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This evaluation indicates a robust operational performance and financial status, which we will explain in more detail below. That being said, if you are looking for upside potential with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, see – Nvidia Stock’s 1 Big Risk Based on the price you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears overpriced in relation to the broader market. Microsoft’s Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly higher than those of most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft’s financial position is very solid. MSFT stock has experienced an impact that was slightly more favorable than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a comprehensive analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft’s performance across the evaluated criteria is as follows: Microsoft has showcased strong performance in key financial metrics. Although its current valuation seems elevated compared to the broader market, it is consistent with Microsoft’s own historical performance. For example, the current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.6x aligns with its 12.4x average over the past four years. Similarly, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35x is in line with the stock’s average P/E during the same timeframe. Looking forward, significant growth in Azure is expected to fuel further increases in valuation multiples. The company’s revenue growth over the next three years is projected to average in the low double-digits, compared to a 12% average over the preceding three years. Overall, despite its recent increases, we believe MSFT stock continues to be an attractive buy at current levels. In fact, we estimate Microsoft’s valuation to be $535 per share, indicating over 15% upside potential. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize potential risks. A downturn in economic growth or a recession could result in decreased corporate investments in infrastructure, potentially affecting Microsoft’s revenue growth. Even though MSFT stock has historically performed better than the benchmark index during economic downturns, a decline in its stock price during such situations cannot be dismissed. Not entirely satisfied with the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a more stable investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
