The Salesforce logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on November 29, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Given its better valuation, we believe that Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) is currently a better pick over its peer, Oracle stock. CRM stock trades at 9.5x trailing revenues, versus 9.8x for ORCL. Although Oracle is more profitable, Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think CRM will outperform ORCL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. ORCL stock has seen strong gains of 225% from levels of $60 in early January 2021 to around $195 now, vs. an increase of about 65% for CRM stock from $220 to $360. This compares with roughly 60% gains for the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Admirably, ORCL stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 85% so far in 2024. CRM stock hasn’t been that consistent, with returns of 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 38% this year – indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including META, COMM, and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Salesforce has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 18.1% from $21.3 billion in 2021 to $34.9 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in January). On the other hand, Oracle’s average revenue growth rate of 9.5% from $40.5 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in May) over this period has been comparatively slower. Salesforce’s revenue growth lately has been driven by an increase in subscription and support sales, amid increased demand for its cloud-based offerings, including – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. Salesforce aims to grow its revenues by leveraging the technological revolution that includes the demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company is benefiting from its AI system – Agentforce. The company continues to introduce AI capabilities across its offerings, which is resulting in increased adoption. Oracle’s revenue growth is also being driven by increased consumption of its cloud offerings. Oracle is benefiting from its success with generative AI workloads. In fact, it expects its revenue to double in five years, as more on-site database customers move to the cloud. As an aside, check out Sell LULU Stock, Buy eBay? Looking forward, both Salesforce and Oracle are expected to benefit from the rising demand for cloud and AI. Oracle is investing in AI infrastructure and has partnered with key players, including AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect both companies to see their sales rise at a low double-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. Looking at profitability, Oracle’s adjusted net income margin has declined from 34.9% in 2021 to 29.7% in 2024, while that for Salesforce has risen from 21.6% to 23.2% over this period. Now, Oracle’s 30.3% adjusted net income margin for the last twelve-month period fares much better than 25.5% for Salesforce. From a financial risk perspective, Salesforce seems to have an edge over Oracle. Its 3% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 16% for Oracle, while its 14% cash a percentage of assets is higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that Salesforce has a better debt position and more cash cushion. We see that Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. On the other hand, Oracle is more profitable. Now, looking at prospects, we believe CRM is the better choice of the two. At its current levels of $360, CRM stock is trading at 37x its trailing adjusted earnings of $9.70 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 43x over the last four years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $190, ORCL stock trades at 32x its trailing adjusted earnings of $5.77 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. We think that an upward revision in valuation multiple for both stocks is warranted, given the rising AI-based cloud demand. ORCL stock, trading at a valuation multiple much higher than its historical average, while CRM stock trading at a multiple lower than historical average, doesn’t make sense in our view. We think this gap will narrow in favor of CRM. While both stocks may offer robust gains in the long term, if one has to pick, we believe CRM is a better choice. While CRM may outperform ORCL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Salesforce’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say

Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z

Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.48%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.28%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.79%) and Block (SQ-1.44%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+1.15%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting. The NCPPR's push comes after an attempt to get Microsoft(MSFT, Financial) to include the digital currency on its balance sheet, which was rejected by the shareholders.

Title: Is Microsoft Corporation Inc. (MSFT) Dominating A Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jobs Report: Implications For The Markets And The Fed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/12/07/jobs-report-implications-for-the-markets-and-the-fed/
Time Published: 2024-12-07T12:34:39Z

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.
