Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/21/fed-easing-cycle-resumes-market-implications/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

Title: The Zombie Stock List Makes Another Call For Five9
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/the-zombie-stock-list-makes-another-call-for-five9/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T19:50:45Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. I first put Five9 Inc. (FIVN) in the Danger Zone and named it a Zombie Stock in December 2022. Most recently, I reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in August 2024, but I removed it from my Zombie Stocks List. Note that the short strategy based on my Zombie Stock List has outperformed the S&P 500 since inception in June 2022. However, the business is running low on cash again and qualifies as a Zombie Stock. So, Five9 is back on the Zombie Stock List. Even with FIVN down 35%+ year-to-date (YTD), further downside remains in this stock. Five9 grew subscription revenue 16% year-over-year (YoY) in 2Q25. This growth was largely driven by enterprise AI revenue growth of 42%. Five9’s total revenue grew 12% YoY in 2Q25. Five9’s management also increased its full year 2025 revenue guidance, which now equals 10% YoY. In the same release, management increased its adjusted EBITDA margin guidance by 1% for the same period. Despite growing revenue in 2Q25 and guiding for YoY growth in the full year, Five9’s revenue growth has been slowing in recent years, while the company has yet to generate any annual profits since 2019. This business is a cash-burning machine and doesn’t have a long runway ahead of it, as I’ll show below. Unprofitable companies with fast-depleting cash reserves are risky investments in any market. These risks are higher when the cost of raising capital is higher. Five9’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) increased from 9.3% in 2019 to 10.1% in the TTM. In August 2024 I removed FIVN from the Zombie Stocks List after the company issued senior convertible notes and increased cash on hand, which ultimately increased Five9’s cash runway to more than 24 months. However, Five9’s cash on hand fell from $1.1 billion in the TTM ended 2Q24 to $636 million in the TTM ended 2Q25. With this lower cash balance (and consistently negative FCF), Five9 can only sustain its TTM free cash flow (FCF) burn for 24 months from the end of August. The company also has a negative interest coverage ratio, and now officially earns its spot back on the Zombie Stocks List. The company will likely need to raise expensive capital once again to avoid bankruptcy, unless it can engineer a turnaround in the profitability of its operations. Otherwise, the stock has a real risk of going to $0/share. Figure 1: Five9 Is Back on the Zombie Stocks List * As of 6/30/25** To calculate “Months till Bankruptcy” I divided the TTM FCF burn, excluding acquisitions, by 12 to get the monthly cash burn. I then divide reported cash and equivalents and long-term investments in the most recent 10-Q by the monthly cash burn. Five9’s FCF has been negative on an annual basis in eight of the ten years of my model (since 2015) and is negative in the TTM ended 2Q25. 2018 was the last annual period the company generated positive FCF. On a quarterly basis, the company generated a positive FCF in just one (3Q20) out of the last 20 quarters. Since 2017, Five9 has burned through a cumulative $1.1 billion (47% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. In the TTM, the company’s cash burn sits at -$299 million. Figure 2: Five9’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2015 Through 1H25 Despite regularly selling stock, the company is still low on cash. Per Figure 3, Five9’s shares have increased YoY every year since the company’s IPO in 2014. Five9’s shares outstanding nearly doubled from 38 million shares at the end of 2014 to 76 million shares at the end of 2Q25. Figure 3: Five9’s Shares Outstanding: 2014 – 2Q25 Five9 continues to grow revenue, but its growth rates are on the decline. The company grew revenue YoY by: Going forward, management guided for 10% YoY revenue growth in 2025, a further slowdown from 2024. Additionally, analysts expect Five9’s revenue growth to lag the forecasted contact center software industry growth rates in the coming years. While analysts expect Five9’s revenue to grow 10% in the full year 2025 and 9% in both 2026 and 2027, Precedence Research estimates the cloud-based contact center market will grow more than twice as fast at 22% compounded annually from 2025-2034. In recent years, Five9 managed to cut its costs down relative to revenue, which helped the company improve its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT). Five9’s total expenses fell from 110% of revenue in 2020 to 99% of revenue in the TTM. However, despite the improvements, Five9’s NOPAT is still negative in the TTM, and has been negative in every year in my model since 2019. The company’s NOPAT sits at -$5 million in the TTM, while its return on invested capital (ROIC) is -1% over the same time. Figure 4: Five9’s Revenue and NOPAT: 2020 – TTM Five9 is the least profitable company among peers in its industry. Per Figure 5, Five9’s NOPAT margin and ROIC both rank below all peers, which include Zoom Communications (ZM) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), SAP SE (SAP), Nice Ltd (NICE), Salesforce (CRM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), 8×8, Inc. (EGHT), Danger Zone stock Twilio (TWLO), fellow Zombie Stock Ringcentral (RNG), and more. The companies that offer full-service solutions (that tie in their contact center software solutions into their other offerings/products and offer a wider range of solutions as a one-stop shop), like Microsoft, Nice Ltd, and Cisco Systems, maintain competitive advantages over niche and singularly focused companies like Five9 and RingCentral. Figure 5: Five9’s Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the revenue and future cash flow expectations baked into Five9’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Five9 fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of $26/share, my model shows that Five9 would have to: In this scenario, Five9’s revenue would reach $8.5 billion in 2034 or nearly 8x the company’s TTM revenue, 3x Nice’s (NICE) TTM revenue, and nearly double Zoom’s (ZM) TTM revenue. For reference, Zoom and Nice’s combined revenue equals $7.5 billion in the TTM. This scenario also implies that Five9’s NOPAT improves to $372 million in 2034, compared to -$5 million in the TTM and the company’s record NOPAT of $6 million in 2018. In other words, to justify its current valuation, Five9 must immediately improve margins to 2x its best-ever level, while also growing revenue faster than the industry. Keep in mind, the number of companies that grow revenue by 20%+ for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Five9’s share price look even more unrealistic. If I instead assume Five9: the stock would be worth just $6/share today – a 77% downside to the current price. This scenario implies that Five9 generates $5.5 billion in revenue in 2034, which would be 5x its TTM revenue. In this scenario, Five9 would also generate $121 million in NOPAT in 2034. Figure 6 compares Five9’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For reference, I also include the TTM revenue of competitors Zoom (ZM) and Nice (NICE). Figure 6: Five9’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Each of the above scenarios assume Five9 grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Five9’s invested capital has grown 27% compounded annually since 2014. If I assume Five9’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Five9 is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $700 million in total debt, has $1 million in underfunded pensions, $3 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, and just $359 million in excess cash. Five9 has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$5/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: How Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/how-micron-stock-surges-2x-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T09:00:27Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Micron Technology stock (NASDAQ:MU) has increased approximately 80% from about $87 at the beginning of 2025 to nearly $157, reaching all-time highs in the process. So, what is driving this increase for Micron? It all revolves around the demand for AI infrastructure, which is boosting sales of high-bandwidth memory products, also referred to as HBM. Even after this substantial rally, Micron stock is valued at about 20× estimated earnings for 2025. Projected growth looks robust: expected revenues are set to rise by 48% this fiscal year, based on consensus estimates, while growth is anticipated at roughly 31% for FY’26. Given this strong growth paired with a reasonable valuation, could Micron stock potentially double to around $300? Below, we outline this scenario. Demand is being propelled by the swift adoption of generative AI, which necessitates high-performance memory to function at scale. While DRAM offers capacity, HBM supplies the bandwidth and low latency required for large language models. Micron serves as a primary supplier for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GB200 platform, alongside AMD’s Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The memory requirements for each AI system are also escalating: for example, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell systems feature 33% more memory per node compared to earlier-generation chips. Additionally, as AI models transition from being text-only to incorporating multimodal formats such as video and speech, memory intensity is on the rise. With AI expected to be broadly adopted throughout the economy, Micron is positioned for a prolonged growth trajectory. To illustrate the scale of the investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have indicated that they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective current fiscal years. However, supply may not keep pace easily. Manufacturing HBM is more intricate than standard DRAM, and supply levels are still constrained. The production of HBM is wafer-intensive — it requires approximately three times as many wafers as standard DRAM to create the same quantity of bits due to its lower bit density and intricate 3D stacking. This forms a natural bottleneck. Although Micron has been expanding its HBM production capacity, output for 2025 is already sold out, with robust demand anticipated in 2026. Micron aims to significantly increase its HBM market share, targeting about 20 to 25% of the HBM segment by the end of 2025. Beyond HBM, Micron remains the sole volume producer of low-power DRAM for data centers, providing an advantage as AI workloads increasingly emphasize efficiency. Looking forward, even after this increase, Micron does not appear to be overvalued. Its revenues surged by 58%, from $21 billion in 2023 to $34 billion in 2024, as the company rebounded from a downturn. Consensus forecasts indicate revenues climbing from roughly $25.1 billion in FY’24 to $37.1 billion in FY’25, and by about 31% to $48.7 billion in FY’26. HBM has been a significant factor in this growth, with HBM revenue achieving a $6 billion annualized run rate and a projected $10 billion run rate by 2026. Increased HBM production does place pressure on conventional DRAM supply, contributing to rising DRAM prices, which may also enhance revenues for products outside of HBM. If we project a slightly more conservative annual growth rate of 25% between FY’26 and FY’28, Micron could generate approximately $77 billion in revenues by FY’28. Micron's net margins were around 20% over the first nine months of this year. It is possible that this figure could grow further due to a higher proportion of higher-margin HBM chips and improved economies of scale. Assuming net margins rise to about 22% in FY’28, this would equate to net income of approximately $17 billion. With a forward P/E ratio of about 20x, this would imply a market cap of around $340 billion, suggesting the stock price could nearly double from current levels. That said, competition persists. SK Hynix continues to dominate the HBM market with an approximate 50% share and an advantage in production, particularly regarding HBM4. Micron is increasing HBM3E production and testing HBM4, but it is still striving to catch up. HBM4 is anticipated to power Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin architecture for AI accelerators. The memory market has also historically been subject to significant cyclical behavior, and Micron is no exception. DRAM and NAND remain vulnerable to fluctuations in supply and demand along with pricing volatility. At this time, it appears that HBM serves as a partially secular growth driver, with AI infrastructure investments, high profit margins, and strong order visibility providing some degree of protection.
