A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now.

Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Watch These Supermico Price Levels as Stock Pops After Volatile Year

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares are likely to remain in the spotlight to start the week after jumping more than 10% Friday to snap a five-session losing streak and log their best one-day performance since early December. Supermicro is looking to move past a volatile 2024 in which accounting and corporate governance issues led to several delayed financial reports. However, CEO Charles Liang said last month that postponed filings will be completed by a Feb. 25 deadline issued by the Nasdaq, easing concerns about a potential delisting. Sentiment may have also received a boost after Microsoft (MSFT) announced Friday that it plans to spend about $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI), a move that could benefit the server maker through increased partnerships and hardware sales. Supermicro shares ended last year with a 7% gain, but surged more than four-fold between January and March before slumping as much as 85% from their record high. Below, we break down the technicals on Supermicro’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Since mid-July, Supermicro shares have oscillated within an orderly descending broadening formation, with the stock tagging both the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time. More recently, the price has traded in a narrow range since mid-December but closed above the 50-day moving average (MA) on Friday on the highest trading volume in over a week. Let’s take a closer look at key support and resistance levels on Supermicro’s chart that investors may be eyeing. The bulls' inability to hold the 50-day MA could initially lead to a retest of the $26 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near the high of a brief countertrend rally in early November. A decisive breakdown below this level may see Supermicro shares drop to around $18, an area about 46% below Friday's closing price where they would likely encounter significant support near the prominent November swing low. Follow-through buying this week could propel a move up to the $39 level, an area currently just below the broadening formation’s upper trendline. The shares may run into selling pressure in this region near two key troughs that formed on the chart in September. Further upside could see the shares climb to around $50, where they may encounter resistance near a trendline that connects a range of comparable price points on the chart from the early-August trough to December peak. Finally, a more bullish move could drive a move to the $63 level. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower prices may look for profit-taking opportunities around the August swing high, which currently sits in close proximity to the downward sloping 200-day MA.
