Blockchain fragmentation and Ethereum's network challenges highlight Bitcoin's enduring appeal as a store of value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

Since the introduction of altcoins, after Bitcoin paved the road for them, we have seen many projects give 10x gains in relatively short periods. It has also been accepted that the crypto space oscillates between altcoin and bitcoin seasons, suggesting more investing opportunities down the line. A deluge of memecoins flooded the market as well, serving as a more robust gambling system (compared to online casinos). As crypto space lost $530 billion market cap over the last 30 days, it is prudent to examine its fundamentals once again. Is such a concept as ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô meaningful moving forward? Is there more to cryptos than cyclical speculation? To answer those questions, we must first remind ourselves of narratives past. During the evolution of the crypto space, Bitcoin became de-facto the only proof-of-work digital asset worth considering, following Ethereum‚Äôs The Merge in September 2022. As a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), The Merge represents a cleavage in blockchain philosophies. While Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work (PoW) requires computational resources, Ethereum‚Äôs PoS eliminates such barriers in order to boost transaction speed and efficiency. In other words, Bitcoin further differentiated itself as a store of value, while Ethereum focused more on cost-effective blockchain utility. At first glance, this may seem perfectly complementary, but there are several underlying problems that eventually reared their heads. Altogether, the PoW-PoS bifurcation translates into PoS fragmentation. If PoS-based assets, and PoS-based platforms competitive to Ethereum, are more reproducible, they can be launched with minimal upfront costs. With this foundation, there is no single altcoin asset to cling onto. Ultimately, with a low barrier of entry, this led to the fragmentation of the crypto market across +34,000 digital assets. From the Bitcoin-Ethereum perspective, as the two largest digital assets by market cap, PoS-led fragmentation manifests as a corrosive effect on Ethereum price level. To put it differently, Bitcoin‚Äôs key features, PoW and scarcity, are reinforcing Bitcoin fundamentals. In contrast, Ethereum suffers from network effect erosion from competing PoS chains, which offer similar functionality and incentive structure. Moreover, the increased complexity outside of Bitcoin is creating a barrier to entry from new capital inflows. Who can spend time filtering thousands of assets and bet that they will have staying power beyond one year? Even sophisticated investors leveraging popular futures trading algorithms often struggle to navigate the fragmented market effectively. In fact, this is precisely why memecoin mania gained traction. The complexity and fragmentation of the crypto market lends itself to thinking of digital assets outside their fundamentals. Instead, focus is then on celebrity endorsements, humor, viral marketing, which often turns into pump-and-dump schemes. Inevitably, this creates a negative feedback loop: But there is an even greater problem than that. Let‚Äôs assume that this negative feedback loop created by memecoins doesn‚Äôt exist. One has to consider if there even is a market for blockchain based solutions, as it was previously imagined. Through anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, governments around the world have expended great efforts to subdue the crypto ecosystem. Let‚Äôs quickly remind ourselves of key promises before regulative sweeps took place: Decentralization as elimination of intermediaries ‚Äì nearly everything is now intermediated through fiat rails, including transfers from self-custodial wallets. Financial inclusion as access for the unbanked/underbanked ‚Äì it is still more convenient to use legacy banking than blockchain tech, which is inherently complex and requires digital literacy. According to the latest EMarketer report, cryptocurrency payment penetration is hitting a wall. Although the number of crypto payment users is expected to rise by 82.1% from 2024 to 2026, this is from a tiny overall population base of only 2.6%. It may very well end up being the case that a digital dollar, a stablecoin like USDT, will subsume this effort entirely in place of a direct CBDC. Censorship resistance as a guarantee that transactions cannot be reversed or intercepted by governments and organizations. Governments regularly pursue innovative mechanisms to cancel such efforts, from debanking to the persecution of smart contract developers. Although Treasury sanctions against Tornado Cash were overturned in January, there is little indication that financial privacy will become a human right any time soon. In fact, indicators point in the other direction. üö® BREAKING: The ECB‚Äôs Digital Euro is set to launch in October.

And if a blockchain-based solution should be deployed, it will be under governments‚Äô terms. Lastly, the entire concept of Web3 is dubious as a decentralized, blockchain-based iteration of the internet. Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE revelations in the case of USAID funding clearly point to great efforts to push narratives, control narratives, suppress and de-legitimize dissent. A semantic, censorship-resistant Web3 is fundamentally at odds with governments‚Äô needs to maintain authority and legitimacy as they push various agendas. To think that established information proliferation nodes such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook would be allowed to erode in favor of Web3 would be foolhardy. Any government needs centralized nodes to maintain power. This was amply demonstrated in the case of the TikTok ban. Although this video reels app is vastly superior to YouTube shorts, a leverage was pulled to sanitize it and make it less relevant. Again, this is another factor that contains the blockchain space to a micro-niche instead of propelling it into mainstream expansion. With this in mind, blockchain space is still worthy of engagement. Bitcoin will likely remain the main focus of crypto investing, owing to its unique, PoW-based network effect. Although the recent White House Crypto Summit was less bullish than expected, it was still positive in the long run. The decision to use seized bitcoins effectively removed this sell pressure from the table. Likewise, President Trump seems to be serious about ending the ‚Äúwar on crypto‚Äù. But looking at the crypto space from a purely innovative solutions perspective, which projects should retail investors consider during steep discounts? These five tokens should be considered as long play exposure during crypto market deflation. After all, it is unlikely that AI narrative will subside any time soon. In terms of top 10 revenue-generation chains during the market slump, crypto activity is clearly on the side of low-friction payment chains (Tron) and general purpose, high-performing chains (Solana, Avalanche). Ethereum still maintains high ranking due to its large market share within the DeFi ecosystem. In conclusion, what should crypto investors keep in mind moving forward? Due to inherent friction with governments, digital assets are unlikely to ever penetrate mainstream to a significant extent. But within the contained ecosystem, investors should focus on long term narratives ‚Äì AI, infrastructure and chain performance. A truly decentralized Web3 should be understood as a niche play that will be countered by deep pockets of Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as centralized node extensions of the USG. By the same token, retail investors would do well to expose themselves to their stock options as safer bets.
