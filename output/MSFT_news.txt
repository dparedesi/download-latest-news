Title: 6 Top Growth Stocks To Buy For August 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Bullish about stocks for the rest of 2025? You’re not alone. Even as the August 1 start date for higher tariffs has arrived, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trending up and flirting with new highs. Plus, analysts from Oppenheimer Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets have raised their 2025 S&P 500 targets. When market optimism is high, growth stocks can pad your wealth quickly. Let's meet six top growth stocks that deserve a closer look. The best growth stocks to buy for August are S&P 500 constituents that meet these criteria: The resulting stock list was ordered from highest to lowest EPS growth expectation, and the top six were chosen for inclusion. The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

Title: Is There More Upside For MSFT Stock?

Time Published: 2025-07-31T13:22:24Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a strong Q4 performance, surpassing consensus estimates for earnings, sales, and its future outlook. This positive news has sent the stock up 8% in pre-market trading, extending its impressive rally of over 50% since its April low of around $350. Despite this significant climb, we believe there’s still considerable upside potential. While Microsoft's current valuation is high, we see minimal cause for concern, making it an attractive investment. Our optimistic view stems from a comprehensive analysis comparing MSFT's current valuation to its recent operating performance and its historical and current financial health. We've assessed Microsoft across key parameters: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This analysis reveals Microsoft's exceptionally strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – META Stock To $1,500? Microsoft has demonstrated notable revenue growth in recent years, outperforming the S&P 500. Over the last three years, its top line has grown at an average rate of 12.5%, compared to 5.3% for the S&P 500. In the most recent twelve-month period, revenues increased by 14.9% from $245 billion to $282 billion, while the S&P 500 saw 4.4% growth. Quarterly revenues in the most recent period grew 18% to $76.4 billion from $65 billion a year ago, against a 4.5% improvement for the S&P 500. This consistent, strong revenue expansion supports the company's robust market position. Microsoft exhibits exceptionally high profit margins, considerably exceeding most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Its operating income over the last four quarters was $129 billion, translating to a substantial operating margin of 45.6%, in contrast to 18.3% for the S&P 500. The company’s operating cash flow (OCF) for the same period was $136 billion, indicating a very high OCF margin of 48.3% compared to 19.8% for the S&P 500. Furthermore, Microsoft’s net income of $102 billion over the last four quarters yielded a considerable net income margin of 36.1%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 11.8%. These strong profitability metrics underscore Microsoft's efficient operations and effective cost management. Microsoft’s balance sheet is characterized by very strong financial stability. As of the most recent quarter, its debt stood at $61 billion, with a market capitalization of close to $4 trillion. This translates to a very strong debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5%, which is substantially lower than the S&P 500’s 23.4%. The company also maintains a healthy cash position, with cash (including cash equivalents) making up $95 billion of its $619 billion in total assets, resulting in a strong cash-to-assets ratio of 15.3% compared to 6.7% for the S&P 500. These figures highlight Microsoft's robust financial health and its ability to manage its liabilities effectively. Microsoft stock has generally shown slightly better resilience than the broader markets during recent economic downturns. During the Inflation Shock of 2022, MSFT fell 37.6% but fully recovered by June 15, 2023. In the Covid Pandemic of 2020, MSFT saw a 28.2% decline from its peak, recovering fully by June 9, 2020, outperforming the S&P 500’s 33.9% drop. Look at Buy or Sell MSFT stock for more details. Overall, Microsoft demonstrates very strong performance across growth, profitability, and financial stability, with its downturn resilience being neutral. This comprehensive analysis points to an overall very strong outlook for MSFT stock. Microsoft’s stock currently commands a premium valuation when compared to the broader market, as well as some of its peers, reflected in its key multiples. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.6, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 3.1. Similarly, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.7 substantially exceeds the benchmark’s 22.8. This is higher than its peers, with META stock trading less than 30 times and AMZN stock trading at 39 times trailing earnings. This elevated valuation suggests market confidence in Microsoft's future performance and its strong competitive position. Microsoft's recent performance strongly suggests that a premium valuation is well-deserved. The accelerating growth in Azure revenues, coupled with improving profitability and a robust outlook, points towards a sustained upward revision in its valuation multiple. While the stock currently trades at over 40 times trailing earnings, it has historically commanded premium valuations; for example, its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last four years is 35 times. Consequently, we believe there is still further upside potential for MSFT stock, despite its recent surge. Of course, this optimistic view carries inherent risks. Investors might become hesitant to pay an even higher premium, particularly given the substantial capital expenditure Microsoft is directing towards AI initiatives. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly consider all associated risks before making any investment decisions. However, for those with a 3−5 year investment horizon, MSFT stock, even at its current levels, could offer significant upside potential. Related – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Now, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Crypto markets see $200M in liquidations as Fed’s Powell gives hawkish remarks

Time Published: 2025-07-31T02:41:19Z

A wave of volatility swept through the cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks on inflation and tariffs sent leveraged traders scrambling. The sudden market tremor resulted in over $200 million in liquidations in a single hour, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $116,000 mark. The US central bank, as expected, left its benchmark interest rates unchanged in its latest policy decision. However, it was Chair Powell’s subsequent comments that captured the market’s full attention. He insisted on the potential for inflationary pressures to re-emerge, particularly from the impact of trade tariffs. This cautious stance was maintained even as two Federal Reserve officials dissented from the decision, signaling their preference for an immediate rate cut. The crypto market’s reaction to Powell’s hawkish tone was swift and sharp. In the hour that he spoke, liquidations of leveraged positions spiked to over $200 million across all digital assets, according to data from CoinGlass. Bitcoin (BTC) felt the immediate pressure, dipping below $116,000. However, the sell-off proved to be short-lived. Later in the session, Bitcoin managed to bounce back above $117,000, though it was still down 0.8% for the day and continued to trade at the lower end of its tight, three-week range. Ether (ETH) experienced a similar whipsaw, initially sliding by as much as 3% before recovering to trade at $3,750, ending the period with a modest loss of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins initially posted even steeper declines, with Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens all dropping by 4%-5% before paring their losses. Meme coins like BONK and PENGU plunged by as much as 10% each before also bouncing back. This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.
