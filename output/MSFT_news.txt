Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

Title: What’s Happening With MSFT Stock?

Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) With a 15% rise year-to-date (YTD), Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has fared much better than the broader S&P 500 index, which has gained just 2%. This outperformance is partly attributed to rising demand for Azure amid the AI boom. Microsoft’s substantial AI investments, especially its partnership with OpenAI, have made Azure a highly appealing cloud platform for businesses looking to integrate AI into their operations. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, MSFT stock has doubled since early 2023, supported by three major factors: We’ll examine these drivers in more detail. While MSFT stock has delivered strong returns, those seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see Archer Aviation: What’s Happening With ACHR Stock? Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% rise in revenue, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $270 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Microsoft's stock has experienced a significant increase in valuation multiples, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio jumping 48% from 9x in 2022 to 13.3x currently. Several key factors are driving this sustained growth: Currently trading around $480, MSFT stock’s P/S multiple of 13.3x is slightly higher than its four-year average of 12.4x. Refer to Microsoft’s Valuation Ratios for additional context. We believe that Microsoft’s valuation is poised for further growth driven by strategic AI initiatives. Azure will benefit from rising enterprise AI adoption, increasing demand for cloud infrastructure, and AI platform services. Additionally, AI integration across Microsoft 365 will boost productivity, enhance user workflows and collaboration, leading to higher subscription retention and premium tier adoption. These AI features are also expected to strengthen Teams engagement, drive enterprise software licensing growth, and accelerate the shift to higher-value cloud services as businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft's comprehensive AI-powered ecosystem. Despite the strong outlook, there are notable risks. In the inflation-led 2022 downturn, MSFT stock dropped 38%, declining from a high of $343 in November 2021 to $214 in November 2022. In contrast, the S&P 500 saw a smaller decline of 25%. Although MSFT rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by June 2023, a similar sell-off occurred earlier this year amid trade war concerns, where MSFT fell nearly 20%, aligning with a 19% drawdown for the S&P 500. More on this is available in our Buy or Sell Microsoft Stock dashboard. Apart from macro and geopolitical risks, Microsoft faces internal challenges, especially regarding its significant capital expenditures. Since 2022, the company’s capital expenditures bill has crossed $144 billion. A pressing question remains: What if these large-scale investments don’t yield the expected returns? Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
