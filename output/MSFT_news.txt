Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Decentralized trading platform Aster, backed by YZi Labs, has launched a groundbreaking new product, stock perpetual contracts, offering crypto-native traders leveraged exposure to leading U.S. equities without intermediaries or custodial limitations. The addition of these stock-based derivatives marks a bold step forward in Aster’s ongoing mission to redefine the boundaries between traditional finance and DeFi. With the new stock perpetuals live on Aster Pro, users can now trade high-demand equities like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), all with up to 50x leverage. More stocks are expected to be added soon. Unlike conventional brokerage platforms that operate within strict trading hours and require full KYC compliance, Aster’s decentralized model empowers users with 24/7 access to equity markets, eliminating red tape, signups, and custodial delays. While liquidity may vary during off-peak hours, reflecting real-world stock market dynamics, Aster ensures efficient execution during U.S. market hours via its deep liquidity pools. This means traders can manage their exposure at all times, with optimal performance during key trading windows. The upcoming NASDAQ 24/5 trading rollout is expected further to improve Aster’s liquidity sync with traditional markets. Leonard, Aster’s Chief Executive, remarked: “Aster is about breaking down barriers, whether that’s asset types, market hours, or outdated trading infrastructures. With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest U.S. equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Aster’s pricing infrastructure relies on the Pyth Network, ensuring accurate and tamper-resistant price data through aggregation from multiple verified sources. This system supports the security and transparency of all Aster perpetuals, be it crypto or stock-based, enabling users to make informed trading decisions with confidence. Combined with a high-speed matching engine and optimized liquidity management, Aster has earned its place as the second-largest perpetual DEX by global trading volume. Traders can use Aster’s stock perps for a variety of strategies. For example, an investor holding Tesla shares outside of the blockchain can hedge downside risk by opening a short position on TSLA/USDT directly on Aster, fully on-chain and permissionless. The introduction of stock perpetual contracts is the latest milestone in Aster’s groundbreaking year. Following the successful launch of the Aster Mobile app, the beta release of Aster Chain —a privacy-first, zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain—and the debut of Hidden Orders, Aster is rapidly expanding its ecosystem to serve both casual traders and seasoned professionals. Aster is pioneering a new frontier by fusing the open, composable nature of decentralized finance with access to real-world assets like U.S. equities. With this vision, the platform is dissolving the boundaries between crypto and traditional finance, crafting a seamless, multi-asset trading experience—all within a decentralized, non-custodial framework. The exchange is actively shaping a future where traders can seamlessly interact with multiple asset classes—all from a decentralized and non-custodial environment.

July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone.

US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. High Yield, Low Risk Road Sign A nifty dividend duo—with yields of 9% and 12%—is ready for takeoff. Thanks to Uncle Sam’s spending bender coinciding with the rise of the machines. Big tech stocks are about to remind Wall Street why it fell in love with these shares in the first place. Think you’ve seen a tech bubble before? Just wait until tech firms report earnings later this month! These companies are growing sales and profits by deploying robots instead of hiring humans. Their AI-driven tools are faster, more scalable, and much cheaper than carbon-based labor. Cost savings are dropping straight to tech bottom lines. Expect proof of trend as the Nasdaq’s increasingly machine-driven companies report banner earnings in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Washington’s $3+ trillion fiscal “open bar” is officially flowing. Policymakers saw a negative GDP print in Q1 and have rapidly revved up the stimulus spigots to avoid a technical recession. Nothing creates market excitement like stimulus cocktails ahead of midterms. As we approach election season, the Fed is under pressure. Will Fed Chair Jay Powell last his final 10 months? I wouldn’t bet on Jay—not when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stands ready to step in and potentially lower the Fed Funds Rate by 300 basis points almost overnight. Talk about bullish fuel! This backdrop makes us contrarians bullish on stocks—with a twist. We could buy and hope for higher prices, but why? Instead, we can engineer dividend yields of 9% and 12% simply by “selling volatility.” To do this we consider covered call funds, which manufacture sweet synthetic dividends with upside price potential to boot. Take Christopher Dyer of Eaton-Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversity Equity Fund (EXG). Chris owns significant stakes in Alphabet (GOOG), owner of Waymo, the autonomous “robot” car company. My kids couldn’t stop talking about it after our recent San Francisco trip. Alphabet itself is becoming “autonomous.” Human hiring has halted. Yet despite flat headcount in the last year, revenues still grew by double digits—14%! Surviving highly-paid “Googlers” are understandably anxious. They developed Gemini, Alphabet’s AI tool, now being deployed enterprise-wide to automate countless tasks. Yes, they created their own monster. Chris’s next big holding for EXG is Amazon (AMZN). CEO Andy Jassy openly acknowledges that Amazon’s workforce will shrink over the next few years. Today may well be “peak headcount!” Microsoft (MSFT), Chris’s largest holding, laid off 6,000 employees in May and another 9,000 just last week. Yet Microsoft isn’t downsizing. It’s upsizing efficiency by rolling out its AI-driven sales and marketing teams, creating “driverless” departments that are equally effective and far cheaper. Tic tac toe, three AI-driven cash cows in a row. Chris is primed to enjoy an impressive earnings season. Remarkably, EXG still trades at a 6% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Meaning, we can grab MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN shares for just 94 cents on the dollar, right ahead of strong earnings. In the meantime, Chris boosts income by selling (writing) covered calls on broad market indexes to generate extra income. Hence EXG’s nifty 9% yield. Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD), managed by Nam To and Wayne Xie, follows a similar strategy and yields an attractive 12%. XYLD holds a substantial 40% tech allocation, capturing this automation-driven profitability boom. However, unlike closed-end fund EXG, XYLD trades at fair value—so no additional discount benefit here. The broader automation trend clearly impacts employment numbers. Last week’s headline 147,000 job gain appeared solid. But removing 73,000 new government jobs (aside: weren’t they supposed to be cutting?) leaves only a gain of 74,000 private-sector positions, significantly below the expected 105,000. Payroll processing firm ADP’s numbers last week were even harsher, a 33,000 private-sector job loss signaling AI’s impact already. The machines are here for the jobs. But we, my fellow contrarians, are here for the payouts—specifically the nifty 9% and terrific 12% yields I’m calling out. It’s big and already starting. Corporate automation plus a $3+ trillion spending bender from Uncle Sam is a powerful recipe for higher stock prices and bigger dividends. Let’s ignore the “tariff worry” headlines. We are following the money, and it is dropping straight into the tech bros’ coffers. Let’s scrape some serious payouts and profits from this soon-to-be uncovered megatrend.

Title: Google Stock To $350?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 10 July 2025, Berlin: The Google logo can be seen on a small door at the stable guard party. Photo: ... More Jens Kalaene/dpa (Photo by Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) Google stock has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $88 levels in early 2023 to approximately $180 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI and cloud computing– the main growth engine for Google. Google Cloud has shown strong performance, with an average revenue growth of 31% over the last three years. This positive trend is anticipated to continue, with sales expected to average over 20% annually for the next three years. The substantial demand for cloud computing services is primarily driven by the growing AI boom, as companies increasingly utilize Google Cloud to quickly implement and scale their AI projects. Additionally, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified Point is, Google has a lot going for it. It also happens to be part of Trefis HQ portfolio strategy that has about 30 stocks. HQ has outperformed S&P and returned >90% since inception. Consider: how much of Google stock is in your retirement portfolio? Talk to an adviser if you’d like to learn about HQ strategy or to see if Google should be part of your portfolio. For Google stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: The convergence of these elements, particularly the AI revolution and growth in cloud computing, opens multiple avenues for Google to meet the performance required to double its stock price over the next 3-5 years. We anticipate Google’s revenues to surpass $500 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double due to improved profitability. Currently, GOOG stock trades around $180, pricing it at roughly 20 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 36 times and Microsoft at 39 times earnings. Given Google’s deep integration of AI and its enhancing profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Alphabet's Valuation Ratios Comparison. Google’s leading position in search, its dominance in digital advertising, and its expanding presence in cloud computing and AI infrastructure offer multiple levers for long-term value creation. This revaluation, supported by accelerating growth in high-margin segments like Google Cloud and YouTube, underpins the potential for the stock to double as markets reassess Alphabet’s earnings potential in an AI-driven economy. Alphabet’s core advertising operations, combined with strategic investments in AI, cloud services, and autonomous technologies, create a well-diversified and resilient growth engine. If these sectors maintain their current trajectory, the stock could see significant upside, driven by both revenue growth and improving operating leverage. While Google’s outlook is promising, several variables could hinder its stock from doubling. Firstly, escalating competition in critical sectors presents a threat. In cloud computing, Google Cloud faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which could pressure its margins and growth rates. Also see – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Likewise, in the rapidly advancing AI sector, rivals such as OpenAI (with ChatGPT) and Perplexity are challenging Google’s dominance in search through AI-driven methods. Secondly, regulatory scrutiny and antitrust actions are considerable concerns. Google is already confronting legal challenges regarding its market dominance in online search and digital advertising. Ongoing probes, including a recent preliminary investigation into its collaboration with Character.AI, underscore a growing regulatory interest in potential anti-competitive behavior, particularly in the emerging AI ecosystem. These developments could restrict expansion, result in hefty fines, or even compel business restructuring. Related – Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit Thirdly, Google’s substantial AI capital expenditures carry execution risks. The company plans to invest around $75 billion in technical infrastructure in 2025 to bolster AI and business growth. If these significant investments do not yield anticipated returns or take excessively long to materialize, investor sentiment may turn unfavorable. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Google’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its search and YouTube platforms, as well as enterprise cloud spending. For more details, see – Buy or Sell GOOG Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like Google less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Investors contemplating Google stock should carefully evaluate these potential risks. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, comprising 30 stocks, has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
