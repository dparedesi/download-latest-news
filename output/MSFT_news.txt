Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings. Tariffs dominated the headlines in 2025 and for the better part of 2024, making it our top term last year. Still, 2025 was shaped more by the impacts, or concerns about the impacts of tariffs on issues such as affordability (see above). That said, investors, consumers, and business owners needed a calculator and a good eraser to try to quantify the impact of tariffs on the real cost of goods, given how many times they were imposed, reduced, or reciprocated by the White House in 2025. There is no doubt that tariffs have become one of the key instruments of economic policy in the 2020s, and we should expect this term to remain popular. Among all the major asset classes in 2025, none shone brighter than gold. The precious metal surged more than 60% year-to-date, as investors, from global central banks to retail investors shopping at Costco on a Sunday, clung to it as the safe-haven asset it is known to be. Even as the stock market and Bitcoin steadily rose throughout most of the year, gold’s allure was too strong for those investors looking for a buoy to cling to in the tumultuous seas of tariffs and stock market uncertainty. Record gold prices spilled over into other metals, such as silver, which also hit record-high prices throughout the year. 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the super-scaling of the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem and infrastructure, and the stocks that took off with it. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA), have been benefitting from the build-out of AI for several years, 2025 was the year we saw companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) blow out their CapEx budgets to the tune of $380 billion, and pledging to spend even more over the next several years. The more they spent, the more their stock prices climbed, until, that is, the last quarter of 2025, when investors and executives began questioning whether these AI stocks are in a bubble. According to Investopedia's most recent sentiment survey, our readers agree. The Trump administration came into office pledging to make America the ‘Crypto Capital of the World’. It began that process by passing the Stablecoin Act of 2025, also known as the Genius Act. That established the first federal framework for payment Stablecoins in the U.S. Our readers wanted to understand what a Stablecoin actually is, how it compares to Bitcoin, and why our federal government wants to introduce a digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar into our banking system. 2025 will also be remembered as the year that sports betting, event betting, and predictive markets went mainstream. Americans are expected to wager over $150 billion in 2025, and with more states legalizing sports betting, bet on that number to grow. As it does, our readers wanted to learn more about the high-risk, high-reward parlay bet, which links together two or more individual bets, known as legs, but only pays out if every leg wins. While there weren’t any major convictions or charges of insider trading in 2025, our readers were searching for what it actually means and whether it was happening in front of us on several occasions this year. This term received extra attention in early April following the so-called “Liberation Day,” as the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on hundreds of trading partners, leading to a near 5% selloff in the S&P 500. As the stock market went on to fall as much as 19% in the subsequent days, the President’s post telling Americans to “Buy Stocks” just before he lifted or paused many of those tariffs on April 9th raised more than a few eyebrows, especially as the market roared back to record highs. Reports of government officials selling stocks before Liberation Day surfaced soon after, but charges were never filed. While technically not a financial term, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, better known as ‘Bad Bunny,’ got as much attention for his business acumen and net worth as he did for his latest best-selling album. 2025 was a good year for Bad Bunny’s money, as he was Spotify’s most-streamed artist, sold out arenas around the world, including a residency in his home country of Puerto Rico, hosted SNL, and was selected to be the headline act at the Super Bowl in 2026. His net worth, according to our latest report, is $88 million, and climbing. Kevin Winter / Getty Images The private markets, which include private capital and private equity, were once an exclusive playground for institutional and well-heeled accredited investors. Inherently opaque, often risky, but tempting with upside potential, private markets have received a public reception from the new administration, which is lowering regulatory hurdles to allow them into defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. In August, President Trump signed an executive order to ‘democratize’ access to alternative investments, such as private markets, paving the way for their inclusion in retirement plans. Our readers sought to learn everything they could about private markets and their potential impact on their portfolios. One of the simplest strategies to generate income in the stock market this year was through covered calls in the options market. The strategy involves an investor who owns a stock with no intention of selling it, does not expect the price to move significantly, and sells a call option that generates a premium for the option's term. If the stock rises in price, the investor gets their premium payment plus the increase in the stock price, up to the strike price. If the stock falls, the investor still gets the premium, which offsets some of the loss. As the stock market has been churning sideways since September, more of our readers have wanted to learn and use this strategy.

Title: Steve Ballmer’s Net Worth Up $20 Billion on Microsoft’s Success

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Francois Durand / Getty Images News via Getty Images Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), has a net worth of $166 billion, up $20 billion this year. That makes him the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list. The secret of the rise is simple. Ballmer kept a large portion of his shares in Microsoft when he left the company in 2014. At the time, he had been the chief executive officer for 14 years. He was also one of the first people Bill Gates hired after he started the company. Today, Ballmer owns 4% of Microsoft, which makes him the company’s largest individual shareholder. Microsoft has a market value of $3.56 trillion. That makes it the fourth most valuable company in the world, just behind Alphabet and ahead of Amazon. The huge increase in Ballmer’s net worth is due largely to Microsoft’s stock being up 124% in the past five years. The S&P 500 is 88% higher in the same period. A much smaller portion of Ballmer’s net worth is based on his ownership of the L.A. Clippers. He bought the team for $2 billion in 2014. According to Forbes, the team is worth $7.5 billion today. Finally, Ballmer gets $1 billion in dividends each year from Microsoft holdings. The forward yield is only 0.76%, but he owns 333 million shares.

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors

Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:18:48Z

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.
