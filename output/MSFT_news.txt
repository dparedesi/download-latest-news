OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

Title: Contrarians Only: A “Flash” Sale On Our Top AI Dividend

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the “one-off” shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these “special situations” just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that’s rarely cheap. And we’re picking it up for a song. It’s a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it’s sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last “cheap” AI play on the board! This one’s dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It’s a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF’s latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that’s rolled in like clockwork. That’s exactly what we bought it to do. And it’s handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF’s average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that’s before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let’s talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings—including big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)—are essentially “bond proxies.” When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: These Small, Unloved Companies Are The Next Big Dividend Plays

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Small caps are (finally!) back, but most people are in the dark about how to tap them for serious dividends. But there is a proven way to do that—one that puts a rich 7.1% payout squarely on the table for us. Everyone has missed this one. We’re going to dive into it today. The main reason I hate to see people ignore small caps—especially now—is that, well, their time has come. As you can see, It’s been a solid decade of small-caps delivering, well, small profits to investors. But it’s time for the script to flip. In fact, it’s already happening: After years of being dusted by big caps, small caps are matching them point for point this year—even pulling ahead, going by the performance of the benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) in orange above, over the last three months. I see that continuing. For one, small firms tend to have close, personal relationships with clients, keeping their loyalty—and small firms’ sales along with it—strong. Moreover, they tend to be domestic, so they directly profit from the US economy’s strength (which we discussed in last Thursday’s article) and get a hedge from global headaches (including on trade), too. Of course, there are drawbacks to buying these “small fry”: For one, unless the company is near where you live, say, or factors into your work life, you probably don’t know much about it. That’s unlike, say, big caps like Microsoft (MSFT), which get loads of analyst and media coverage. Another, of course, is the dividends. Many small caps are earlier in their growth process—and if they’re lucky, on their way to becoming tomorrow’s large caps. Unfortunately, this means many can’t afford to both fund that growth and pay dividends. This is why, for the most part at my CEF Insider service, we’ve focused on closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold large caps and high-yield bonds. Not only have they delivered bigger gains than small caps, but they’ve been handing us high, steady dividends, too. You get a sense of that when you compare the average CEF yield—8.3%—with the payout on the small-cap benchmark iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM): a mere 1%. Still, every rule has its exception. When it comes to small caps, that exception is a CEF called the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). This fund (in orange below) has closely tracked small caps, but with a twist: It “translates” small cap gains into dividends—7.1% payouts, to be exact. The power of a fund like RVT is in its structure: the managers at Royce Investment Partners invest in many different small caps—488, to be exact. Its three top holdings are IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) and SEI Investments (SEIC). Note this chart: IESC (in blue above) installs electrical and technology systems for businesses and had $2.9 billion of sales in its latest fiscal year. Revenue soared 16% in the latest quarter on strong data-center growth (no surprise there). Meantime over at financial firm SEIC (in orange), EPS jumped 70% and revenue jumped 8% in the latest quarter, driven in part by higher interest in alternative investments. As for financial-insurer AGO (in purple), the firm saw net income rise 32% in the last quarter as municipalities continued rolling out bonds at a record pace. All of these stocks’ gains are pushing up RVT’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), putting a lift under its share price. Royce’s job is to take profits on its winners and use its gains to buy up-and-comers and maintain its 7.1% dividend. Now, to be sure, RVT’s dividend does float a little. That’s because it has a mandate to pay dividends at a yearly rate of 7% of the average of the last four quarters of NAV (calculated at quarter-end). So if NAV rises, payouts do, too. I like this payout strategy because it means the fund is not bound to a fixed payout and has flexibility to reinvest gains in other opportunities where it sees them. And even with that flexibility, RVT’s dividend has been remarkably consistent (and even up modestly) over the last five years: Moreover, RVT is still available at a 9.2% discount to NAV. That markdown has momentum, too, up from double digits in late August. Given that RVT’s discount shrunk below 6% in January, before tariff fears sent it plunging in the spring, we still have potential for upside on a closing discount here. The bottom line is that RVT has been doing a good job of “translating” small cap gains into 7% dividends for a long time.
