Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

Nvidia and Microsoft said they will invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic as part of the deals. Medtronic (MDT) shares rose 4% after the maker of medical devices reported better-than-expected fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook.

Title: Capture the Rally With These Dividend Plus Growth ETFs

Dividend stocks are not traditionally known for their share price rallies. Companies making distributions to stockholders tend to be stable and well-established, with their biggest growth days long in the past. Similarly, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold baskets of dividend stocks tend to provide investors with a healthy passive income stream simply for owning shares rather than capital appreciation. Occasionally, though, investors can find the best of both worlds. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VEA), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA: EFA), and SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: SPYV) are three ETFs that pay noteworthy dividends and deliver notable capital appreciation. While not the highest of any ETF making distributions, the dividends are still enough to provide a compelling perk for shareholders—especially considering these ETFs are trading at or near year-to-date (YTD) highs after experiencing sizable rallies. VEA capitalizes on the strong performance of many international equity markets in 2025, some of which have outpaced the S&P 500's already robust 15% returns YTD. The fund can be a long-term investment option for investors seeking access to non-U.S. equities. Like many other broad-based Vanguard ETFs, it boasts a highly competitive expense ratio—just 0.03% per year. Comprised of nearly 4,000 total stocks, VEA offers a highly diversified group of stocks at a low cost. The fund's geographic and stock mandates are expansive, as it holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum from Canada, Europe, and parts of the Pacific, with European stocks comprising 52% of its holdings. Japan is the single largest country by portfolio allocation, accounting for approximately 21% of the portfolio. VEA pays out a dividend yield of 2.74%, which is quite high for a fund that doesn't specifically employ a dividend strategy. On top of that, the fund has rallied by close to 29% YTD, or about twice the return rate of the broader U.S. market during that period. Utilizing a similar approach to VEA, EFA distinguishes itself with its large-cap focus. Both funds are sizable and trade very actively, although EFA's trading volume tends to be higher than VEA's, making it a prime choice for traders looking to move in and out of positions more frequently. EFA's basket of stocks is not as extensive as VEA's, but with nearly 1,000 holdings, it still offers exceptional diversification. While the portfolio focuses on European names, Japanese stocks represent the largest portion of the portfolio, at approximately 22%. The fund also invests in a smaller percentage of Australian equities, which may appeal to investors seeking a specific geographic tilt. Where EFA falls short a bit is in its annual fee, which is substantially higher at 0.32%. Still, with an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and YTD returns of nearly 29%, there are plenty of benefits to considering this fund nonetheless. The SPYV adopts a different approach from the two above. Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla. However, it does highlight that Tesla’s volatile stock is risky amid a potential market pullback. Yup, super Tesla fan Cathy Woods is directing her firm to sell Tesla too. Tesla shares are at least 10x any reasonable valuation. Only gullible retail investors and index funds are propping it up. When it crashes, it will be fast. It currently trades at a 275 price-to-earnings ratio, which is expected to keep rising this quarter, even if the stock continues to drop from its recent high, as earnings are expected to decline further in Q4. Now, this is not financial advice, but I think it’s worth noting that even though Tesla’s stock hasn’t been linked to its fundamentals in a while, its most significant stock price growth occurred during its period of earnings growth. These days, it’s hard to imagine Tesla going back to earnings growth any time soon. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
