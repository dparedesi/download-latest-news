ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Finance I’m just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn’t?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs). For those “in the know” about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us—and I’d argue they’re not even the best one! The best-in-class CEFs out there—and here I’d definitely include the three we’re going to get into below—also offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly. And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It’s an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV). This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can’t issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you’re buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice “rinse-and-repeat” cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. Of course, these kinds of opportunities don’t tend to last, and in the last year we’ve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That’s got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let’s look at three. First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today. That’s despite its generous 7.9% dividend, which should be getting more attention. So, by the way, should the fund’s performance. ETO Total Returns Beyond the discount and dividend, ETO’s 12.3% annualized return on NAV (orange line above) should also be a shiny lure for investors. But as you can see, ETO’s market price–based total return (in purple) has lagged, inflating its discount from where it was a half-decade ago. That’s clearly an error on the market’s part, and it makes ETO well worth a look today. We’ll find an even bigger discrepancy with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB), a 9.1%-yielder holding S&P 500 mainstays like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). This high-powered roster should put ETB on investors’ radar, yet the gap between its total NAV return (in orange below) and total price return (in purple) is huge. ETB Total Returns With a 11.3% annualized return over the last half-decade (based on NAV), ETB’s managers have clearly done their job. Yet investors have taken little notice, causing its market price–based return to lag, and its discount to widen to 7.8%. Completing the picture is the fact that ETB has averaged a 1.7% premium in the last decade. That gives it plenty of upside as its overdone discount flips to the fund’s “normal” premium. Finally, consider the John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO), which subscribers to my CEF Insider service might remember. We’ve held BTO twice in the past and have booked nice double-digit total returns both times. BTO, which yields 7.5%, focuses on the financial sector, mainly banking firms, with M&T Bank (MTB), Mississippi-based Renasant Corp. (RNST) and US Bancorp (USB) all top holdings. BTO Total Returns These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price–based return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund’s long-term trend, which includes a premium that’s hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO’s pricing went from around par earlier this year to today’s premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: 5 Stocks To Buy As The Stock Market Nears All-Time Highs

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five companies have strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects. The stock market's remarkable recovery from earlier 2025 volatility has investors questioning whether it's still a good time to buy. The S&P 500 hit 6,000 for the first time since February following strong economic data. Subsequently, it fell to a low of 4,910 in April due to Tariff concerns and investor pessimism as Trump rolled out his new economic plans. In May, it bounced back, and despite ongoing Tariff concerns, the S&P 500 closed out the Month with a gain of more than 6%, its best monthly performance since November 2023. Current market conditions present both opportunities and challenges for investors. While some analysts worry about overvaluation, earnings estimates have been revised to 7% growth for 2025, suggesting markets are no longer priced for an adverse outcome. The recent recovery from the spring market correction demonstrates the resilience of quality companies with strong fundamentals. The methodology for selecting these five stocks focused on companies with compelling growth prospects, strong competitive positions and the ability to thrive in various market conditions. I analyzed quantitative metrics, including revenue growth, profit margins and valuation ratios, while also considering qualitative factors such as market leadership, innovation capabilities and long-term strategic positioning. These selections represent diverse sectors that are well-positioned to benefit from current economic trends. Tesla remains the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, with expanding operations in energy storage, solar panels and autonomous driving technology. The company has successfully scaled production across multiple global facilities while maintaining industry-leading margins. Despite recent volatility stemming from tensions around Elon Musk’s involvement in the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which temporarily cut $152 billion from Tesla's market capitalization, the underlying business fundamentals remain strong, with growing EV adoption worldwide. Tesla's market leadership in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) sector positions it perfectly for long-term growth. The company's vertical integration strategy, from battery production to charging infrastructure, creates substantial competitive advantages. Recent developments in autonomous driving technology and energy storage solutions provide multiple revenue streams beyond traditional automotive sales. The temporary price decline from Elon Musk’s entanglement with politics and perhaps declining mental stability creates an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Tesla's global expansion, particularly in emerging markets, combined with decreasing battery costs and improving production efficiency, suggests strong earnings growth potential. The company's innovation pipeline, which includes robotaxi services and energy grid solutions, offers significant upside beyond its current valuations. Microsoft stands as one of the world's most valuable companies, dominating cloud computing through Azure, productivity software via Office 365 and emerging AI technologies. The company has successfully transitioned from traditional software licensing to subscription-based services, creating predictable recurring revenue streams. Microsoft shares advanced significantly in early May, with AI developments reigniting investor interest. Microsoft's diversified business model provides stability and growth across multiple technology sectors. The company's leadership in cloud computing continues to expand as enterprises accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. Azure's growth trajectory, combined with Microsoft's early integration of AI across its product suite, positions the company perfectly for the next wave of technology. Microsoft recently secured a significant deal to bring 1 million Copilot users on board from a single enterprise client, potentially generating over $350 million annually. This adds momentum to its AI strategy, following strong Q3 earnings and record-high share prices. With Azure growth holding steady and demand for AI-integrated tools on the rise, the deal reinforces Microsoft’s position as a market leader. At the same time, the stock trades at a premium, continued execution in cloud and AI could justify the valuation, and support further upside. Palantir specializes in big data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms, serving government agencies and commercial enterprises. The stock has surged nearly 75% this year, leading the Nasdaq 100's constituents so far in 2025, driven by expanding federal government contracts and growing commercial adoption. The company's unique position in data integration and analysis creates substantial competitive moats. Palantir's government contracts provide stable, long-term revenue streams with high switching costs due to the mission-critical nature of their platforms. The company's work for the federal government has grown substantially, creating predictable cash flows that support aggressive growth investments. The expanding commercial segment demonstrates Palantir's ability to monetize its technology beyond government applications. The company's AI and machine learning capabilities position it perfectly for the current technology cycle. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision making, Palantir's platforms become essential infrastructure. The high barriers to entry in this specialized market, combined with strong customer retention rates, suggest sustainable competitive advantages that justify premium valuations. Johnson & Johnson represents one of the world's largest healthcare conglomerates, with diversified operations spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products. The company sustains a broad economic moat through outstanding cash flow generation, a growing research pipeline, and multiple revenue sources. Recent strategic acquisitions, including the $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular, a biopharmaceutical business, demonstrate ongoing portfolio optimization. Johnson & Johnson's defensive characteristics make it an ideal holding during market volatility, while its pharmaceutical pipeline provides significant growth potential. The company's consistent dividend payments, supported by strong cash flows, offer income stability that's particularly attractive in uncertain economic environments. J&J's global reach and diversified product portfolio provide resilience against regional economic downturns. The healthcare sector's demographic tailwinds, driven by aging populations worldwide, create sustained demand for Johnson & Johnson's products and services. The company's strong research and development capabilities, combined with strategic acquisitions, continuously refresh its product pipeline. J&J's excellent credit rating and financial flexibility enable continued investment in growth opportunities while maintaining shareholder returns. HIMS & Hers operates a direct-to-consumer telemedicine platform, offering personalized healthcare solutions that include treatments for hair loss, sexual wellness, mental health and skincare. The company reported a significant increase in net income for the fourth quarter, generating $26 million in net income, up from $5 million in the same period last year. The platform's subscription-based model creates recurring revenue streams with high customer lifetime value. The digital healthcare revolution accelerated by the pandemic has created permanent behavioral changes in how consumers access healthcare services. HIMS capitalizes on this trend by offering convenient and affordable alternatives to traditional healthcare delivery. The company's direct-to-consumer model eliminates intermediaries, improving margins while reducing costs for patients. HIMS addresses large, underserved markets where traditional healthcare often fails to provide adequate solutions. The company's focus on stigmatized conditions creates intense customer loyalty and reduces price sensitivity. Expanding product offerings and geographic reach provide multiple growth vectors, while the subscription model ensures predictable revenue growth. The digital-first approach positions HIMS perfectly for the future of personalized healthcare delivery. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling opportunities as markets near all-time highs, each offering unique advantages for different investor profiles. Tesla provides exposure to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, Microsoft offers stability with AI growth, Palantir captures the data analytics boom, Johnson & Johnson delivers defensive income with growth potential, and HIMS capitalizes on the digital healthcare transformation. While market timing remains uncertain, these quality companies with strong competitive positions and compelling growth prospects offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for long-term investors navigating today's elevated market levels.
