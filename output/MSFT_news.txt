The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Economic leaders had a lot to say about the future of artificial intelligence in the workforce — and the perspectives vary. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shot down an unsolicited offer by Elon Musk to purchase OpenAI for $97.4 billion. Astera Labs crushed estimates for the fourth quarter and guided higher than views for the current period. But ALAB stock wavered in extended trading. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has delivered great gains to investors over time -- advancing 600% over the past decade, for example, and rising in the double digits just last year as investors piled into the biggest tech stocks. The owner of top search engine Google also has an established track record of earnings growth, making it a company investors know they can count on over time. Investors were disappointed when Alphabet's quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates -- and capital spending plans exceeded estimates. Non-tech investors interested in AI and its effect on the stock market need only look for one clear warning sign: any cuts in AI spending by the hyperscalers. Historically, few companies have demonstrated more millionaire-maker potential than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). And so far, there is little evidence that the emergence of low-cost Chinese rival DeepSeek (which claims to have trained an industry-leading LLM on "primitive" H800 chips) is hurting demand for Nvidia's newest chips. BlackRock shares are presently trading 8.5% below its 52-week high. Does this represent an opportunity to buy? Read on to know. None of our picks is Nvidia or Amazon or Tesla. Investors may wish to widen the aperture to find the best stocks for outsize earnings growth. Incyte stock was one of the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 Monday after the drugmaker's fourth-quarter adjusted profit and projections for 2025 sales of key medications fell short of analysts' estimates. Investors are weighing Trump's pledge on Sunday to introduce additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from all countries. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Fears Over Tariffs And AI Spending Overwhelm Better Earnings

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: This 7.6% Dividend Can Protect Your Wealth From A Trade War

USA flag Canadian Flag Mexico Flag side by side Trade tensions ratcheted up to 11 this week, and I know that for many readers the wild swings we’re seeing can feel sickening. To you, I say that times like these are exactly why we hold the closed-end funds in our CEF Insider portfolio. Their high, steady dividends (more than 10% on average across the portfolio) let us collect our income while stocks regain their footing. We also avoid the trap of panic selling, then seeing the story whipsaw the other way, locking in our losses (which would’ve happened if you’d hit the sell button first thing Monday morning). That’s a key advantage of all CEFs. And perhaps the coolest thing here is that we have CEFs that are purpose-built for times like these, like the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX)—current yield 7.6%. That’s because SPXX “goes on offense” in the form of exposure to S&P 500 stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), American Express (AXP) and Pfizer (PFE). At the same time, it plays “defense” with a strategy that creates more income when volatility ticks up. That strategy is the fund’s sales of covered-call options. These offer investors the right to buy SPXX’s stocks at a fixed time in the future, at a fixed price. If the stock fails to hit that price (more likely in a correction), nothing happens, and SPXX keeps the fee it charges for the option, fueling its 7.6% payout. Here’s how recent trade drama sets the table for SPXX and CEFs like it. No matter what ultimately happens, in terms of the length or level of tariffs ultimately imposed (and on whom), the question is to what extent they’d change the flow of funds between manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers. More important, we want to know whether those changes would result in less consumption and, as a result, economic troubles. For Canada, tariffs would almost certainly mean a recession, since 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. The situation is similar in Mexico. About 78% of that country’s exports go to the U.S., with the automotive, agricultural and energy sectors most likely to get hit. This, in turn, could cause prices for food from Mexico and energy from Canada to rise. This also explains why the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reached a deal to pause these tariffs for a month, which means investors don’t have to worry about the impacts of a potential trade war for now. But a month isn’t a particularly long time, and we can expect other factors influencing trade and prices to become more significant. Expect more discussion about other factors driving the price movements of food and energy that could offset the tariffs, such as the fact that Canada has boosted energy production, including 7% year-over-year increases in crude-oil output, according to the Canadian government. All of this leaves first-level investors — by those I mean the ones who stick mainly to the big-cap S&P 500 names — struggling to figure out if Trump’s tariffs will damage company valuations or not. One thing that’s for sure (as we CEF investors know well) is that, given that the worst-case scenario is for higher inflation, selling stocks and going to cash (which loses value faster as inflation rises) makes no sense. Further, a U.S. recession is unlikely, as early indicators of over 3% GDP growth suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders. Even in a scenario where China, Canada and Mexico were to retaliate in full, America just doesn’t export enough for that to hit the entire economy all at the same time. A jittery stock market underpinned by a still-strong economy is perfect for SPXX and other covered-call CEFs. That fact is starting to catch more investors’ attention. Consider that since I wrote about SPXX here on Contrarian Outlook in late November, it has returned about 5%, as of this writing, while the S&P 500 has been flat. Market volatility has been driving SPXX’s performance, and the attention that’s been attracting has shrunk its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) to 4.7%. Note that SPXX’s discount hasn’t flipped to the big premium it saw in 2022, when investors were hunting for pretty well anything that could give them a volatility hedge. And if fears keep growing — on tariffs or whatever else — expect SPXX’s discount to flip to a premium (taking its market price with it). Meantime, buying SPXX now means collecting its 7.6% dividend while we wait for that to happen. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Amazon wants to spend $104 billion, and the stock gets clipped: What Wall Street is saying

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazing what some foreign-exchange fluctuations and eye-popping capital expenditures guidance will do to a large-cap tech stock. Amazon stock (AMZN) was clipped by 3% to $231.80 each in premarket trading on Friday after the tech giant delivered mixed first quarter guidance and promised big spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, ahead of retail investor favorite Palantir (PLTR), which has been on a post-earnings tear this week. Amazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion, with the miss the function of a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations. Similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) this earnings season, Amazon uncorked a whopper of a capital spending guide. It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The Street has opted to stay bullish on Amazon after its results for two reasons, however. Most analysts have pointed to a sales reacceleration in the key Amazon Web Services cloud business later this year, amid the company's aggressive spending. Watch: How Salesforce's CEO is planning for the AI future "The shares have pulled back on the guidance and the fact that 2025 is likely an investment year, but we expect by second half 2025 this heavy capex investment + accelerating AI adoption (which we believe will also accelerate the move to the cloud) should begin to materially re-accelerate cloud revenue," Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a client note. The other factor is that Amazon just had a good quarter. What stood out to Yahoo Finance: Three straight quarters of 19% sales growth for AWS. AWS operating profit margin of 46.9%, versus 29.6% a year ago. The second consecutive quarter of accelerated sales growth at Amazon's physical stores. Amazon delivered its highest quarterly operating income ever at $21.2 billion. Here are several of the best Wall Street insights on Amazon's quarter and outlook. Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $260/Reiterated "Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and appears to have numerous healthy organic revenue growth opportunities driven primarily by their high margin AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business [already #3 in the world behind GOOG (BUY) and META (BUY)] and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams leveraging their massive scale. This is all enhanced by what we believe is the potential to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation. AMZN remains on track at AWS and appears ahead of schedule on better monetization in its core retail/advertising/subscription businesses." Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Previous: $235 "Commentary from management suggested that AWS is healthy with adoption across their services, whether they be AI-related or non-AI. Furthermore, it was noted that while it wasn't a huge impact, once AWS becomes less capacity constrained, they expect they'll be able to accelerate growth even more which they expect to occur in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that AWS is the best positioned of the three hyperscalers, as conversations with our DEN experts indicate that Amazon has quickly caught up and now surpassed Azure in AI-related services." Rating: Overweight/Reiterated Price Target: $270/Reiterated "Amazon views GenAI as the largest opportunity since cloud and the biggest tech shift since the Internet, w/virtually every app likely to infuse GenAI and most companies utilizing agents over time. Amazon views the $26.3B capex in 4Q as a reasonable representation of its 2025 capital investment rate, translating to about $105 billion in 2025 annual capex. The majority of spend will support growing need for tech infrastructure for demand across AI services, along w/support for North America and International. Amazon noted it only procures infrastructure given strong demand signals, which we view as bullish for AWS’ multi-year growth trajectory. In light of DeepSeek, CEO Andy Jassy believes the cost of inference will substantially come down over time. However, similar to cloud, where AWS cut prices 134 times between 2006-2023, Amazon believes lower inference costs will increase customers’ total spending as customers infuse applications w/inference and GenAI (i.e. Jevons Paradox). Like for Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), heavy infrastructure investment should be a competitive advantage, and we believe the spending bodes well for multiple years of strong AWS revenue growth." Rating: Outperform/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Reiterated "We reiterate our Outperform rating and $280 price target and highlight possible catalysts in the intermediate-term, including (1) growing AI contributions to AWS growth as capacity constraints abate beginning in 2H25, (2) more meaningful improvements in cost to serve driven by deeper automation and robotics, (3) commercialization of AI capabilities in Alexa, (4) monetization of Project Kuiper which could begin late this year or in 1H26, and (5) an expected increase in Prime Subscription prices early next year."

Let’s discuss the latest in AI because, yes, there are ripples into Dividendland that are not fully appreciated by mainstream investors. First the DeepSeek disruption in AI, and let’s take vanilla dividend darling Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which yields 12.2% as our example. Is that big divvie still safe and secure? Income seekers are constantly staring at the fund, writing in to ask me if they have permission to: Not quite. And definitely not now. QYLD is like a breakfast beer. There is a time and a place for it, but it is not something we want to indulge in daily. QYLD’s strategy is a straightforward approach. It buys the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 and simultaneously sells (“writes”) covered calls on the index itself to generate income. In doing so, QYLD sacrifices potential upside for real cash from the option premiums it collects. Result: Its 12.2% yield. But note that this options writing does not guarantee a floor on the price of the fund itself. Again, there is a time and a place to buy this thing. Since we last discussed QYLD, it has returned a terrific 26.7% in just 15 months. If you missed it then, well, I wouldn’t chase it now. Especially with the latest DeepSeek news weighing on some outsized positions held by the fund. AI chatbot DeepSeek sank the Nasdaq last week. Nvidia (NVDA) shares nosedived from their nosebleed level, shedding 16% in a week. The “problem” for NVDA was that Chinese engineers created a more efficient AI mousetrap, one that does not require endless processing power to run computation after computation after computation. DeepSeek takes shortcuts to find answers, similar to our human brains. While DeepSeek used NVDA chips, evidence suggests that the company developed its model using less powerful processors. Even if DeepSeek may have obtained NVDA chips illegally via sketchy third parties in Singapore to evade export restrictions, the big takeaway is that its engineers still were not working with the latest chips. So, DeepSeek’s technologists have now shown the world that you can do AI with less money and complex tech. (And they open sourced their code to cement the accomplishment!) Big picture this is bullish for overall AI adoption. We’ll see greater applications even sooner. But there will be winners and losers and prominent domestic companies here in the US are licking their wounds. Losers in our dividend portfolios? No. We didn’t touch NVDA, which shareholders dumped to the tune of $600 billion from fear that more efficient AI won’t need its newest chips. But even after the selloff, NVDA shares still trade hands at a swollen 26-times sales. (For perspective, Meta Platforms (META) fetches 11-times revenues while Alphabet (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) command 7X and 9X respectively. Price to Sales Ratio Good luck with that. The stock’s paltry 0.03% yield won’t stop sellers. Which is going to weigh on QYLD—it has a 7.7% position in NVDA! I bet most owners of the fund don’t realize this. They see the 12.2% dividend and think “safe” when really this is anything but. QYLD also has a 7.8% position in Microsoft (MSFT), which dropped 6.5% last week in the DeepSeek aftermath. MSFT owns 49% of OpenAI, the “fat cat” of the American AI industry that was caught off-guard by the hungry, savvy Chinese engineers. And here’s some additional irony. In vintage Chinese fashion there is speculation that DeepSeek engineers “distilled” answers from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to train its ChatBot. (The biggest smoking gun? When asked who it was, DeepSeek replied that it was ChatGPT. Ha!) This becomes quite embarrassing when we consider that ChatGPT runs on Microsoft’s Azure servers. Microsoft should have caught this. But no. So, DeepSeek “mind melded” with ChatGPT—and now the “parasite” outperforms its “host.” Bad news for NVDA and MSFT which combine for 15.5% of QYLD. Avoid. And I haven’t even bitten into Apple, which is drifting off to an antiquated tech island of its own. AAPL has no meaningful AI play and its sales malaise reflects this. Revenues have only climbed 2.5% total over the past three years. If not for inflation, the company would have a shrinking top line, and without buybacks, no meaningful increase in earnings! Apple is QYLD’s largest holding at 9.1%, bringing us 24.6% dead NVDA, MSFT and AAPL weight. And “America’s ticker” SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is no safe harbor. (I sarcastically refer to SPY as America’s ticker because it is the most over-owned investment in the land.) SPY carries 19% deadweight in the big three. Bad enough. There was a time and a place for SPY too and yes, it has had an amazing run. But we are entering a “Trump 2.0” stock market with defined winners and losers. Tariffs protect certain sectors and hurt others. Lower regulation generally helps healthcare… except we now have RFK Jr., who scares healthcare investors. And DeepSeek is disrupting tech. It no longer makes sense to own everything. Bye bye, SPY. We should also avoid QYLD’s analogous Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD). XYLD employs a similar strategy to QYLD, but buys S&P 500 stocks while writing covered calls against the index to generate yield. Its 10.6% dividend is enticing, though potentially dicey—XYLD has 20.8% exposure to NVDA, MSFT and AAPL. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
