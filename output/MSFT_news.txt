Investing ASML (ASML) holds 100% of EUV lithography for advanced chips. Microsoft (MSFT) controls 80% of office productivity. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) captures 90% of search. Microsoft generates over $70B in annual free cash flow with 43% operating margins. ASML analysts forecast 25% annual earnings growth over five years. Alphabet revenue jumped from $400B in 2025 to projected $455B in 2026. Antitrust rulings confirmed its search monopoly but imposed mild remedies. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Monopolies, we’re told, are bad things. With excessive market power, they can raise prices, reduce innovation, lower product quality, and offer less consumer choice. This is why they often draw antitrust scrutiny and ethical concerns. Yet some companies achieve dominance through sheer innovation, scale, and technological barriers that competitors simply can’t breach. These natural leaders don’t rely on underhanded tactics; instead, they build moats so wide that they become indispensable to their industries. Regulators may occasionally poke at them, but their core strengths endure, making them some of the best bets for long-term growth. There are three such powerhouses that stand out for the benign power they wield that you should consider buying for your portfolio today: ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These firms command virtual monopolies in their niches, offering investors stability and significant upside potential from secular trends like digital transformation and semiconductor demand. ASML Holding is a Dutch dynamo that essentially controls the production of the world’s most cutting-edge chips. ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems are the only viable tools for fabricating most processors at 7nm and smaller nodes, powering everything from smartphones to AI supercomputers. Without ASML’s machines, industry titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung would likely grind to a halt, as no credible alternatives exist in this hyper-specialized field. This isn’t just dominance — it’s a stranglehold built on decades of R&D, intricate patents, and a supply chain that’s nearly impossible to replicate. ASML’s market position is bolstered by its better than 90% share in advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) tools and complete control over EUV, where rivals like Nikon and Canon lag years behind. As AI and 5G drive insatiable chip demand, ASML benefits from surging orders, with projections for mid-teens revenue growth in 2026 despite short-term headwinds from China export curbs. Analysts forecast 25% earnings growth annually over the next five years, fueled by High-NA EUV ramps and logic/memory capex from clients like Taiwan Semiconductor, which just announced plans for $56 billion in 2026 spending. ASML’s monopoly insulates it from cyclical downturns, and with global chip fabs expanding, it’s poised for 20% or more growth through 2027. Wall Street rates it a Buy, with targets up to $1,550 per share, implying solid upside from current levels around $1,335 per share. For investors eyeing the AI boom, ASML is the ultimate enabler. Google parent Alphabet reigns supreme in the digital search arena, where its engine processes billions of queries daily and captures about 90% of the global market. This isn’t accidental dominance — it’s the result of network effects, vast data troves, and a superior algorithm that keeps users loyal and advertisers hooked. Bing and DuckDuckGo nibble at the edges, but they lack the scale to challenge Google’s ecosystem, which seamlessly integrates search with YouTube, Maps, and Android. In 2025, Alphabet’s revenue hit roughly $400 billion, with 2026 projections at $455 billion — a 14% jump — driven by ad recovery and cloud gains. Earnings per share are expected to rise 6% to $11.27, though some see mid-teens growth if AI integrations like Gemini continue accelerating. The company’s forward P/E of around 28 reflects its premium status, but with operating margins north of 30% and free cash flow gushing, it’s justified. Antitrust rulings in 2025 confirmed Google’s search monopoly but imposed mild remedies, preserving its core business while avoiding breakups. Alphabet’s appeal lies in its diversification: Beyond search, Google Cloud is growing 30%, and “Other Bets” like Waymo hint at future revenues. Analysts overwhelmingly rate it a Buy, with price targets averaging $318 and highs at $400 per share, suggesting 20% gains. In a data-driven economy, Alphabet’s monopoly ensures steady compounding. Microsoft has evolved from a software relic into a cloud and AI juggernaut, holding an 80% grip on office productivity tools through Microsoft 365 and a 20% to 30% share in cloud infrastructure through Azure. Its monopoly stems from an ecosystem lock-in: Businesses rely on integrated suites like Office, Teams, and Dynamics, where switching costs are prohibitively high. Competitors like Google Workspace exist, but Microsoft’s enterprise entrenchment and AI infusions through Copilot make it irreplaceable. Fiscal 2025 revenue soared 15% to $281.7 billion, with Azure up 34% and Q1 2026 hitting $77.7 billion (18% growth). Operating margins stand at 43%, generating over $70 billion in free cash flow annually. Analysts project 16% revenue growth in 2026, with EPS climbing similarly, propelled by AI adoption and cloud migration. Despite hefty capex for AI infrastructure, Microsoft’s AAA balance sheet supports dividends and buybacks. This stock is a buy for its defensive moat and offensive growth: Azure could snag the top cloud spot from AWS, and AI utilities promise recurring revenue. With 39 of 43 analysts rating it Buy and targets averaging $630 per share, implying 37% upside, Microsoft offers a portfolio both reliability and growth.
