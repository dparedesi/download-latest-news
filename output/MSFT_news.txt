We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer — in an announcement made just before the vote — was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk’s extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It’s unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon.

The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks — within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan’s Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. “It’s been a highly politicized decision the entire way through” Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it’s still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. “I think it’s possible but I don’t know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They’re in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,” said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. “Nippon had said they would invest and wouldn’t take anything [capacity] down. But now we’re at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it’s likely that US Steel takes down a facility,” said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM’s heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) — given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of TSDD

December 31, 2024 16:50 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above, while the per Share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund’s total market value, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares current ETF offering is presented below: Gregory FCA for GraniteSharesKathleen Elicker, 484-889-6597graniteshares@gregoryfca.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or visit www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Dividend stocks are currently in focus as Wall Street analysts expect them to rebound in 2025 amid changing market preferences. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon expects dividends from S&P 500 companies to increase by 10% in 2025. But which dividend stocks are safe and reliable for long-term investors? Let's turn to a case study for ideas. Earlier this month, a dividend investor shared his income report and milestone on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with more than 644,000 members. He said his average monthly dividend income this year was $1,000. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things. The investor said this income was about 30% more than last year. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed that his average monthly dividend income was around $978 or $11,742 per year. "I'm quite happy with that!" he added. The 35-year-old investor said his portfolio’s current value was $485,000. He also shared screenshots of his portfolio holdings. Let's take a look at some of his biggest positions. Broadcom Number of Shares: 220 According to the portfolio screenshots he shared, the investor had 220 shares of Broadcom (AVGO), one of his biggest positions. Over the past year, AVGO shares have gained about 113%. Fidelity UCITS SICAV – Fidelity U.S. Equity Income Fund Number of Shares: 4,092 Fidelity U.S. Quality Income UCITS ETF Inc USD (FUSD) was the second-biggest position in the investor’s portfolio in terms of dollar value. Over the past 12 months, the fund has been up 16%. See Also: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Microsoft Number of Shares: 91 Microsoft (MSFT) was another low-yield technology dividend stock in the portfolio that generated about $1,000 per month. In a note, Stifel recently said Microsoft is poised for growth in 2025 due to AI monetization. The firm lifted its price target on MSFT to $525 from $500. Arbor Realty Trust Number of Shares: 2,731 New York-based mortgage REIT Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) has a dividend yield of just over 12%, according to Benzinga Pro. Last month, the company posted third-quarter earnings that came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. British American Tobacco p.l.c. Number of Shares: 932 British American Tobacco plc (BATS) was another high-yield dividend stock in the portfolio. The company has been paying dividends since 1984. Oracle Corporation Number of Shares: 160 Oracle (ORCL) shares were up 62% in 2024 through December 28. However, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. recently downgraded the stock to Sell from Neutral with a $130 price target, citing valuation concerns. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! JPMorgan Chase Number of Shares: 106 The investor, who earned about $1,000 per month in dividends, had 106 shares of JPMorgan in his portfolio. The bank has raised its dividend every year since 2009. Realty Income Corporation Number of Shares: 420 Realty Income (O), one of the most famous monthly dividend stocks among Redditors, was also a part of the portfolio as the investor had 420 shares of the REIT. Realty Income raised its dividend by 0.2% earlier in December. BlackRock Number of Shares: 19 The investor had 19 shares of Blackrock (BLK) in his portfolio. Earlier this month, Citi said in a note that BlackRock was one of the best asset managers heading into 2025. The firm has a Buy rating on the stock. Altria Group Number of Shares: 358 Tobacco giant Altria (MO) was recently upgraded to Buy from Neutral. Analysts believe the company will benefit under the upcoming Republican administration due to lower corporate taxes, tariffs and strong border controls. Its price target was increased to $65. According to Benzinga Pro, Altria has a dividend yield of 7.8%. Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider. For instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.

Reddit remains a relatively new public company, having just debuted via an initial public offering in March 2024. In short, Reddit is delivering in a big way in its first few months as a public company. APO's Q4 alternative net investment income is likely to be $265 million, suggesting a 9% annualized return on alternative net investments. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock rose by 70% during 2024, catapulting the company to a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk put his cash and influence behind the Trump campaign, and investors are speculating the company will benefit from lighter regulations under the incoming administration, which might help fast-track its artificial intelligence-powered full self-driving (FSD) technology. FSD has the potential to transform Tesla's economics, but the company faces a serious challenge in the shorter term. The stock market is taking a breather after a relentless run, but opportunities still abound, according to some on Wall Street. Each of the major market indexes hit new highs in late 2024, but the recent weakness could be a harbinger of what's to come. For today’s news roundup, the guys clarify what Russia’s bitcoin mining ban actually means – plus other stories. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock posted big gains in Friday's trading. The server specialist's share price closed out the day's trading up 10.9% amid gains of 1.2% for the S&P 500 index and 1.7% for the Nasdaq Composite index. In addition to bullish momentum for the broader market today, Super Micro Computer (also called Supermicro) stock got a big boost from new artificial intelligence (AI) spending guidance from one of the tech industry's biggest players. A Relative Strength Rating upgrade for Charter Communications shows improving technical performance. Will it continue? Here's what was so positive about what Microsoft had to say, and why it may have tamped down some recent market fears. In a blog post this morning, Microsoft Vice President Brad Smith wrote bullishly on the prospects and importance of generative artificial intelligence. Facebook parent Meta, Amazon, Uber, and Chewy are top stock picks, writes Wolfe Research analyst Shweta Khajuria. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the sour final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. The major indexes posted big wins in 2024, a year that was marked by a continued surge in the artificial intelligence trade — led by the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — even as the bull rally broadened across the board. The single biggest winner in the S&P was Palantir (PLTR), with a nearly 350% gain for the year, while the biggest loser was Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which gave up 64% of its value. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate cut in four years, and President-elect Donald Trump's impending return to the White House drove stocks higher in the last two months. (Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 0.2%. The benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%.

Recently, Northland analysts reiterated their Outperform rating for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD. Financial) and set a price target a price target of $175, or nearly a 40% upside from Tuesday's $125 close. Northland has AMD among its top picks for 2025 because it is also a confidence play, as the firm should be able to increase market share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and PC clients. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMD. Embedded gaming remains one of the headwinds for AMD, and its strategic roadmap is to overcome the respective headwinds and take full advantage of the growing demand for AI-driven technology. The projections say AI-related revenue could reach up to $5.2 billion by 2024 and increase to $9.5 billion by 2025, indicating solid growth potential. AMD's Turin CPUs also beat Intel's Granite Rapids in data center workloads, which is a big driver of its expected 10% growth in non-AI data center revenue to $8.5 billion in 2025. Also on the cusp of a possible PC market refresh cycle is the phase-out of Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) support for Windows 10, which could help push AMD client revenue up by 25%, year over year, to $7.9B in 2025, driven by upside potential. Despite the challenges in the gaming and embedded markets, Northland forecasts gaming revenues to remain flat, and embedded revenue is expected to return to $4 billion in 2025. The recent $333 million investment in AI cloud startup Vultr continues the company's focus on developing AI infrastructure and pushes its edge in the GPU market even further alongside Nvidia. AMD is positioned strongly financially and has a forward-looking innovation focus that is worth watching in the tech space. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio
