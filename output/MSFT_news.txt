If you’ve been researching investment options for building long-term wealth, chances are you’ve come across the term “VTSAX.” It’s one of the most recommended mutual funds among financial experts and personal finance communities. But what exactly is VTSAX, how does it work, and is it the right investment for you? In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about VTSAX in simple terms. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand this fund better, this article is designed to help you make an informed investment decision. Contents VTSAX stands for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares. It is a low-cost mutual fund offered by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world. VTSAX is designed to give investors exposure to the entire U.S. stock market in a single investment. This means that when you invest in VTSAX, you own a tiny piece of over 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies – from large corporations like Apple and Microsoft to small-cap stocks you’ve probably never heard of. The popularity of VTSAX boils down to a few key benefits: VTSAX uses a passive investing strategy. It aims to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes nearly all U.S. stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap). Instead of trying to beat the market like actively managed funds do, VTSAX simply tracks it. This strategy leads to lower trading costs, minimal turnover, and greater tax efficiency. VTSAX holds thousands of companies across a wide range of industries. Some of the top holdings include: These top holdings typically make up a larger percentage of the fund due to their market capitalization. Many investors compare VTSAX vs VTI because both offer exposure to the total U.S. stock market. The main differences are: Functionally, both are nearly identical in terms of holdings, performance, and expense ratio. VTSAX is ideal for: However, it may not be suitable for short-term traders or those looking for high-risk, high-reward investments. To invest in VTSAX, you typically need to: You can also set up automatic investments and dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for VTSAX. One of the biggest advantages of VTSAX is its low expense ratio of 0.04%. That means you pay just $4 annually for every $10,000 invested. This low fee helps more of your money stay invested and grow over time. There are no load fees or commission fees when buying directly through Vanguard. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, VTSAX has historically performed in line with the overall U.S. stock market. Over the long term (10+ years), the average annual return has been approximately 7-10% depending on market conditions. During bull markets, VTSAX tends to rise steadily, and during bear markets, it will decline, but not as drastically as individual stocks. VTSAX pays quarterly dividends that can be reinvested or taken as cash. These dividends come from the profits of the companies in the fund and can provide passive income, especially over time as your investment grows. Dividend yield typically ranges from 1.2% to 2.0%, depending on market conditions. Like all investments, VTSAX carries some risk: Here’s how VTSAX compares to similar total market funds: VTSAX is one of the best all-in-one investment options available today. It combines simplicity, low costs, and broad diversification, making it an excellent choice for investors who want to grow wealth steadily over the long term. Whether you’re saving for retirement, building a nest egg, or just starting out, VTSAX offers a reliable path toward financial independence. If you’re looking for a single fund that provides exposure to the entire U.S. economy with minimal effort and fees, VTSAX is hard to beat. FAQs About VTSAX Is VTSAX good for beginners? Yes. VTSAX is one of the most beginner-friendly investments due to its simplicity and diversification. What account should I use to invest in VTSAX? Tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs, Traditional IRAs, or 401(k)s are ideal. Can I lose money with VTSAX? Yes, VTSAX is subject to market risks. However, the long-term trend of the stock market has historically been upward. How do I buy VTSAX if I don’t have $3,000? You can invest in VTI, the ETF version of VTSAX, which has no minimum investment. Does VTSAX include international stocks? No, it only includes U.S. stocks. For international exposure, consider adding VTIAX to your portfolio. Categorized in: Share Article: Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Title: Best Dividend Stocks for Steady Passive Income

If you want your money to work for you, dividend stocks are one of the smartest ways to build steady passive income over time. Many investors, from beginners to retirees, rely on dividends to supplement their income without having to sell their shares. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the best dividend stocks, how to choose them, and which ones to consider adding to your portfolio in 2025. Contents Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. These payments are typically made quarterly, though some companies pay monthly or annually. Unlike growth stocks that reinvest most of their earnings to expand the business, dividend-paying companies are usually more established and focus on rewarding shareholders. Key Features of Dividend Stocks: Dividend investing is popular for many reasons: When searching for the best dividend stocks, you need to look beyond just the dividend yield. Here are some key metrics: This is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock’s current price. A higher yield means more income, but extremely high yields can be a red flag. This measures how much of a company’s earnings are paid out in dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally better, suggesting the company has room to grow or weather downturns. Look for companies that consistently increase their dividends year after year. This shows financial strength and shareholder commitment. Stable earnings mean the company can maintain or grow its dividend even in tough economic times. This is the cash left after operational expenses and capital expenditures. It’s a more accurate indicator of dividend sustainability. These are well-established companies with reliable dividends and strong financials. Think Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson. Companies that have increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Firms with 50+ years of consecutive dividend increases. These are required to pay out 90% of their income as dividends. Examples include Realty Income and American Tower. Stable and regulated businesses that provide consistent dividends. Now let’s dive into some of the best dividend stocks to consider for steady passive income. If you’re more risk-tolerant and looking for higher income, consider these: Spread your investments across different industries to reduce risk. Use DRIP plans to compound your returns over time. Hold dividend stocks in Roth IRAs or tax-deferred accounts to avoid unnecessary taxes. Don’t just chase high yields—balance them with companies that offer stability and growth. Keep an eye on earnings reports, dividend announcements, and economic conditions. If picking individual stocks feels overwhelming, dividend ETFs are a great alternative. Even strong companies can reduce or eliminate dividends during tough times. Stock prices can fluctuate, even if the dividend remains steady. If dividend growth doesn’t keep up with inflation, purchasing power may decline. Rising interest rates can hurt utility and REIT stocks. Investing in the best dividend stocks can be a game-changer for anyone looking to earn steady, passive income. With a little research, patience, and diversification, you can build a dividend portfolio that supports your financial goals now and in the future. Whether you’re saving for retirement, supplementing your income, or just want your money to work smarter, dividend stocks offer a reliable path to financial independence.

Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
