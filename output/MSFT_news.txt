(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $460?

More Deutschland GmbH headquarters building in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on May 23, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has experienced a notable increase of 16% over the last month, surpassing the S&P 500’s 6% rise. This growth is primarily attributed to Microsoft’s impressive Q1 earnings exceeding expectations and a positive outlook, bolstered by its dominance in cloud computing and AI, especially with significant Azure growth. However, following its recent ascent, is MSFT stock still worth buying? Yes, we believe that MSFT stock, which is currently priced around $460, offers an appealing buying opportunity. Though its present valuation is elevated compared to the benchmark index, making it susceptible to negative events, we do not see any significant reasons for concern. Our assessment stems from a thorough evaluation of Microsoft’s present valuation relative to its historical operational performance and financial condition. We have examined Microsoft against key criteria: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This evaluation indicates a robust operational performance and financial status, which we will explain in more detail below. That being said, if you are looking for upside potential with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, see – Nvidia Stock’s 1 Big Risk Based on the price you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears overpriced in relation to the broader market. Microsoft’s Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly higher than those of most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft’s financial position is very solid. MSFT stock has experienced an impact that was slightly more favorable than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a comprehensive analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft’s performance across the evaluated criteria is as follows: Microsoft has showcased strong performance in key financial metrics. Although its current valuation seems elevated compared to the broader market, it is consistent with Microsoft’s own historical performance. For example, the current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.6x aligns with its 12.4x average over the past four years. Similarly, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35x is in line with the stock’s average P/E during the same timeframe. Looking forward, significant growth in Azure is expected to fuel further increases in valuation multiples. The company’s revenue growth over the next three years is projected to average in the low double-digits, compared to a 12% average over the preceding three years. Overall, despite its recent increases, we believe MSFT stock continues to be an attractive buy at current levels. In fact, we estimate Microsoft’s valuation to be $535 per share, indicating over 15% upside potential. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize potential risks. A downturn in economic growth or a recession could result in decreased corporate investments in infrastructure, potentially affecting Microsoft’s revenue growth. Even though MSFT stock has historically performed better than the benchmark index during economic downturns, a decline in its stock price during such situations cannot be dismissed. Not entirely satisfied with the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a more stable investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Briefly Reclaims Title of World's Most Valuable Company on Solid Earnings

Nvidia briefly returned to the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies when its stock soared in early trading Thursday following a strong first-quarter earnings report. Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped more than 6% in early trading on Thursday, adding more than $200 billion to the company’s market value and pushing the company's market cap to $3.49 trillion, edging out Microsoft’s (MSFT) $3.41 trillion value. Nvidia stock gave up ground throughout the day, and Microsoft ultimately overtook the AI chip giant in market value by Thursday's close. Nvidia shares reacted on Thursday to a solid quarterly report on Wednesday afternoon. Nvidia reported record revenue in its fiscal first quarter as AI demand remained robust. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to be the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. The three are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia reached that milestone almost exactly a year ago, while Apple first closed at $3 trillion in June 2023 and Microsoft reached $3 trillion in January 2024. All three stocks have been hit to a certain degree by economic and trade uncertainty this year, but only Microsoft and Nvidia have shaken off the worst of it. Nvidia's and Microsoft's stocks are up about 5% and 9%, respectively, since the start of the year. Apple shares, meanwhile, are down about 20%, battered by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on China, where the company assembles the majority of its products, and insistence that it move production to America. Nvidia’s market cap, despite Thursday's gains, remains below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Update—May 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest share price and market value data.

Title: Apple is falling behind its Magnificent 7 rivals. Here's why

The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. While the others — Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late — and quietly. The last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company’s attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. Technology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn’t had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI “companions” that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone’s dominance. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. Read more: Apple’s brutal year keeps getting worse Apple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg’s company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration’s 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026. Apple’s first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple’s crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it’s not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple’s App Store looms large. Wall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth. China has been central to Apple’s strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China’s smartphone market. And Apple can’t even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company’s ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China’s generative AI rules. The company’s struggles in China don’t even take into account the swirling — and massive — economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. On Apple’s last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump’s tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact. Apple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China — pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. But Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump’s Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. Announcements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud — and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy. Yes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn’t been enough. Right now, Apple isn’t losing. It’s just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse.
