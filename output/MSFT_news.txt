Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground ahead of Friday morning's release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' September jobs report. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a minimal decline of less than 0.1%. Shares of beer, wine, and spirits maker Constellation Brands (STZ) dropped 4.7%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on the day after the company released mixed results for its fiscal second quarter. The company behind the Corona and Modelo brands reported strong beer sales during the period but pointed to macroeconomic challenges affecting the alcoholic beverage industry. Bio-Techne (TECH) shares sank 4.4% on Thursday. In its most recent quarterly report, released in August, the provider of reagents and other health care diagnostics products missed earnings per share (EPS) expectations. A year-over-year jump in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs weighed on results. According to analysts, Bio-Techne also faces stiff competition in an industry that requires rapid innovation. Telsa (TSLA) shares lost 3.4% after the carmaker recalled around 27,000 of its Cybertrucks because of an issue with the vehicles' rearview camera. When the Cybertruck is put in reverse, the rear-facing image can appear blank for up to eight seconds, according to a filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This marks the fifth recall for the Cybertruck since its release last year. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), which operates an electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, notched Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, popping 7.5% higher after the company reported record levels of trading volume across its platforms in September. The company highlighted strong year-over-year volume growth in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipals. Crude oil futures prices jumped more than 5% to reach their highest level since August amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The latest uptick in oil prices helped boost numerous stocks in the energy sector. Shares of refiner Valero Energy (VLO) jumped 6.2%. Shares of Texas-based energy generator Vistra Corp. (VST) surged 5.7% to an all-time closing high after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), said the tech giant is exploring ways to power its artificial intelligence (AI) data centers using nuclear energy. Analysts expressed optimism that last month's deal between Microsoft (MSFT) and Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania could pave the way for additional agreements between big tech firms and nuclear generators. On Thursday, RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Vistra shares to $141 from $105. Constellation Energy shares were up 4.5% on Thursday following reports that the company aims to secure a $1.6 billion federal loan guarantee to help fund the Three Mile Island project. According to The Washington Post, Constellation submitted a request for the government-backed loan to the Department of Energy in May, and after passing an initial review, the application is now in a negotiation stage.

Title: Why Vistra Stock Jumped to Another Record High on Thursday

The gains keep coming for shares of independent power producer Vistra Corp. (VST), which jumped more than 5% on Thursday to notch one of the best performances in the S&P 500 and set a new record closing high. The Texas-based electricity provider has ridden a wave of enthusiasm about using nuclear capacity to power energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) processes. These AI-driven expectations have helped Vistra surpass Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, up a whopping 244% year to date. The most recent push higher for the red-hot Vistra stock came after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), said the tech giant is exploring ways to power its data centers using electricity from nuclear plants. Vistra shares gained 5.7% on Thursday to close at $132.45, bucking a broader downturn for U.S. stocks. In an interview with Japan's Nikkei, Pichai said Google is evaluating investments in a variety of energy technologies as it aims to achieve its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. The CEO provided no details as to where Alphabet might source nuclear power. However, announcements this year by other big tech firms support the idea that U.S.-based nuclear generators are poised to benefit from the opportunity. For instance, Amazon (AMZN) said in March that it would lean on nuclear generation to meet some of its power demand. Microsoft (MSFT) also reached an agreement in September with Vistra competitor Constellation Energy (CEG) to procure power from the currently shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Analysts have expressed optimism that Microsoft's deal with Constellation Energy could set a precedent for more agreements between big tech and nuclear generators. On Thursday, analysts at RBC Capital Markets increased their price target on Vistra stock to $141 from $105.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports third-quarter results before the bell next Thursday, Oct. 10, its first report since July's worldwide IT outage caused by a CrowdStrike (CRWD) software update forced the carrier to cancel thousands of flights, costing it an estimated $500 million. Analysts expect a slight year-over-year gain in revenue to $15.69 billion, with net income projected to tick lower to $1.10 billion, according to analysts' consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts covering Delta tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on the airline's stock, with an average target price of $61.40, about 30% above Thursday afternoon's share price of $47.38. In July, Delta posted record second-quarter revenue, but a number of costs rose at least 20%, leading profit to come in well below what analysts had expected, and shares fell 4% that day. Revenue could continue its strong pace set in the first two quarters of the year, as airlines have said travel demand has remained strong, with July 4 travel setting TSA checkpoint records. However, Delta is also likely to have lost out on some revenue and incurred costs handling the mid-July IT outage. Delta's Q2 results came about a week before the IT outage that hindered Delta's operations for several days. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian estimated that the canceled flights and compensation for passengers cost the airline at least $500 million. Delta was the hardest hit of the major airlines, and said it has considered legal action against CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT), but the tech companies have said they aren't responsible for the age of Delta's IT infrastructure or how the airline responded to the outage.

Title: The Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks Over the Past 30 Years Might Surprise You
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/best-performing-s-and-p-500-stocks-8720206
Time Published: 2024-10-03T16:01:59Z

When analyzing the top-performing stocks over the past three decades, it's striking that the leaders are not all from the technology sector. While tech powerhouses such as NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have undeniably driven exceptional returns, standout performers exist in many less-expected industries. Other top performers include firms in healthcare, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. This underscores the value of diversification. In addition, it reminds us that the pull of tech stocks often overshadows specific industries like apparel, footwear retail, and homebuilding. By broadening their focus beyond tech, investors can still identify long-term prospects in these often-overlooked industries. To assess the long-term performance of U.S. stocks, we selected stocks from the S&P 500 index because it represents large, established companies that are leaders in their respective industries. Each stock's 30-year price returns were calculated to provide a comprehensive view of historical growth, resilience, and volatility. Focusing on a time horizon of 30 years captures various economic cycles and provides a better understanding of how these companies navigated changing market conditions. Over the past 30 years, various companies across various sectors have demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, evolving into industry leaders with significant market influence. From ResMed's (RMD) pioneering digital health products to Ross Stores' (ROST) success in off-price retail, to Pool Corporation's (POOL) leadership in backyard products, and Biogen Inc.'s (BIIB) neurological therapies, these companies show the broad opportunities available beyond traditional technology stocks. In addition, giants like Amazon and NVIDIA have transformed their industries, while firms like Netflix and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) have led shifts in consumer behavior. Founded in 1989, ResMed has grown from a small startup focused on sleep disorders to a multinational corporation at the forefront of digital health products for sleep and breathing-related conditions. ResMed's core business involves devices that treat sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The company's continuous positive airway pressure (better known by its acronym, CPAP) machines and masks have become ubiquitous in the industry. RMD operates through two key segments: sleep and respiratory care, which focuses on devices for managing sleep and breathing disorders, and software as a service (SaaS), which provides a business management platform for out-of-hospital healthcare providers. Many of the companies on this page can claim such outsized returns over the past three decades because they were, at points, penny stocks—those that trade below $5 per share. Many penny stocks, including those from these companies, spent time traded over the counter, not on the major American exchanges. ResMed's journey from a sleep apnea startup to a major international firm reflects the evolving landscape of respiratory care, which has shifted to at-home technologies for an aging population. The company's focus on connected devices, software, and cloud-based products has positioned it at the intersection of healthcare and technology. Over the years, ResMed has continually updated its CPAP machines, making them more compact, quiet, and user-friendly. The introduction of its AutoSet technology in the 1990s, which automatically adjusts air pressure based on the patient's needs, marked a significant leap in these machines since it enabled more personalized and comfortable treatments. In the early 2000s, ResMed diversified beyond sleep apnea into broader respiratory care, targeting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory conditions. This expansion helped the company tap into the growing demand for non-invasive ventilation devices, especially in home care settings—these would have even more impact when used for some patients after the pandemic hit in 2020. ResMed’s acquisition of Ventilation Solutions and other respiratory-focused companies further strengthened its portfolio in this space. In the 2010s, ResMed also began shifting toward connected devices and software products. The launch of AirView in 2014, a cloud-based platform for remotely monitoring sleep apnea and respiratory care patients, was pivotal in this. This platform allowed healthcare providers and consumers to track patients in real time. Over the past three decades, ResMed has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its product portfolio and market presence. Most notably, the company acquired the German healthcare company CuraMed in the late 1990s and the U.S. software company Brightree in 2016. The company further expanded its product portfolio through acquisitions like Medifox Dan in 2022. Ross Stores, the parent company of Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, has grown significantly over the past several decades. Focused on offering name-brand apparel and home décor at discounted prices, Ross has consistently expanded its footprint across the U.S., becoming one of the largest off-price retail chains. Despite challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers, including the global recession in 2008 and the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Ross maintained profitability through its off-price strategy. The company had consistent revenue and earnings growth, especially between 2010 and 2019. Post-pandemic, Ross and other off-price retailers are growing off trends among younger shoppers. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ross aggressively expanded, first in the Midwest and then throughout the country. This steady increase has allowed Ross to solidify its presence in nearly every U.S. state, especially targeting underserved markets and suburban locations. Unlike many other retailers, Ross has historically maintained a limited online presence. Instead, the company focused on driving foot traffic to physical stores, which offer constantly rotating inventory and a "treasure hunt"-like shopping experience. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of its stores, Ross bolstered its digital presence to complement its core in-store experience. In the early 2000s, the company operated around 700 stores. Today, it has over 1,900 Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS locations across the United States. Founded in 1993 in Louisiana, Pool has steadily grown into one of the world’s largest wholesale distributors of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and outdoor leisure products, serving both commercial and residential markets. Its product portfolio includes essential pool maintenance items such as chemicals and replacement parts, as well as packaged pool kits and landscaping products. The company also sells irrigation systems, outdoor lighting, grills, and outdoor kitchen components, along with golf course irrigation and water management products. POOL went public in 1995 and expanded rapidly. Since then, it's executed an aggressive acquisition strategy, which has played a significant role in its growth, both domestically and internationally. Major acquisitions, such as the purchase of South Central Pool Supply in the late 1990s, several European distributors, and Horizon Distributors have broadened its markets into irrigation and lawn management. Pool now operates over 440 sales centers worldwide. Over the past decade, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pool benefited from a surge in home improvement spending, as more homeowners stuck at home invested in pools, spas, and outdoor living projects. That said, the pool business is notoriously seasonal, with demand depending on weather patterns, regional climates, and the wider economic landscape. This can create challenges in managing inventory and staffing levels. Founded in 1978, Biogen has been a key player in the biotechnology sector for decades, particularly with its focus on neurological diseases. Early on, Biogen established itself as a major developer of multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies with the launch of Avonex in 1996, one of the first treatments for relapsing-remitting MS. Over the years, Biogen continued to enhance its MS portfolio with the introduction of other breakthrough therapies like Tysabri (2004) and Tecfidera (2013), which have been crucial in helping patients manage this chronic disease. Tecfidera, in particular, became a blockbuster drug and cemented Biogen’s sway in the MS market. The past two decades have seen significant shifts in its strategic direction, marked by triumphs and very public challenges. Biogen gained significant momentum in the 1990s by launching its first major product, Avonex, for multiple sclerosis. It then had success with the launches of Tysabri and Tecfidera. These drugs generated significant revenue and established Biogen as a major player in neurology care—but those revenues were innately finite and due to run out once generics and other treatments were later allowed to be sold. In the mid-2000s, Biogen expanded its neurology portfolio with Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. This marked a successful foray into rare diseases and demonstrated its ability to develop therapies for complex neurological conditions. Biogen also entered the biosimilar market, offering more affordable versions of existing biological drugs. At the same time, BIIB's revenue stream had been facing increasing pressure due to patent expirations and competition from generics and biosimilars. This is why Biogen has been actively pursuing diversification strategies to cut its reliance on the MS franchise and find new avenues for growth. This leads us to its Alzheimer's disease research, premised on a controversial amyloid-beta targeting approach (the belief that certain plaques in the brain are among the causes of the disease). The company developed Aduhelm from this research, which received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 but sparked significant controversy over its efficacy and exorbitant price tag. Biogen's accelerated approval of Aduhelm and subsequent pushback from the medical community, payers (insurers and customers), and even the FDA cast a shadow on Biogen's Alzheimer's strategy and raised concerns about its clinical trial data and marketing practices. In 2024, it abandoned the drug. Meanwhile, Biogen has been seeking new growth drivers, including expanding its biosimilars portfolio, advancing its pipeline in areas like neuropsychiatry and immunology, and looking at acquisitions that fit its strategies. In 2022, Biogen received traditional approval for Leqembi (lecanemab), an Alzheimer's drug said to have more robust clinical data than Aduhelm. Netflix has dramatically transformed how the world consumes entertainment over the past two decades. From its niche beginnings as a DVD-by-mail service, it has evolved into a global streaming behemoth, shifting the television and film industries. Netflix has said that it plans to stop releasing its streaming numbers in 2025, which could leave investors and consumers in the dark about the relative popularity of Netflix itself and its offerings. Founded in 1997, Netflix has transformed from a mail-order DVD rental business into a global powerhouse in the streaming industry. Initially, the company upended the retail video rental market with its subscription-based DVD delivery model. In 2007, it shifted the entertainment landscape again by launching its streaming service, quickly expanding internationally. Within six years, Netflix was making its first forays into producing original content with the release of House of Cards, signaling its ambitions to become more than just a distributor of others' work. The company’s investment in original programming quickly and dramatically expanded, leading to popular series such as Stranger Things and The Crown and award-winning films like Roma. Today, Netflix streams in over 190 countries, offering a vast library of licensed and original content to its 270 million global subscribers. Over the last two decades, Apple has cemented itself as one of the world’s most influential technology companies. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple was initially known for its personal computers. However, it was the early 2000s that marked the beginning of Apple's most transformative era. The launch of the iPod in 2001, followed by the iTunes Store in 2003, upended a music industry that was already changing to digital offerings, positioning Apple as a leader in consumer electronics and digital media. The company operates through five geographical segments: the Americas, Europe (including India, the Middle East, and Africa), Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. Apple may have made its name as an early purveyor of personal computers, but it's long since become a smartphone company. In 2023, iPhone net sales were just over half of its revenues, while its computer business was less than 8%. Apple has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three decades, evolving from a computer manufacturer adored by a relative few to one of the world’s most valuable companies. Its ascent during this time has produced no shortage of books studying how the company did it. In the early 2000s, Apple introduced products like the iPod and the iTunes Store, which shifted how the music industry, then under a grave threat from digital piracy, sold much of its content. However, the real turning point came in 2007 with the launch of the iPhone, a product that redefined smartphones and became the cornerstone of Apple’s growth. Apple has continued to produce new products—its launches, streamed live, are widely covered as almost cultural events—that include the iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods while enhancing its software and services ecosystem through the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. Under the leadership of Steve Jobs and, later, Tim Cook, the company has focused on integrating hardware, software, and services, creating a continuous experience for users. Financially, Apple's growth has been staggering. Its stock has experienced substantial appreciation, especially after its stock splits in 2014 and 2020, which made it more accessible to retail investors. The company reached a historic milestone in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to surpass a $2 trillion market capitalization. Apple’s business model has shifted in recent years toward a greater emphasis on services, which now represent a significant portion of its revenue. This has helped it move away from its dependence on hardware sales. NVR has quietly become one of the most successful homebuilders in the U.S. Unlike many of its competitors, NVR has focused on financial stability and controlled growth, leading to impressive returns for its shareholders. The company operates across the four major regions up and down the U.S.'s eastern seaboard. Founded in 1980 and based in Virginia, NVR is known for its disciplined, risk-averse approach to land acquisition and very efficient operation. NVR doesn't develop on its land but is "land light," contracting to buy finished lots from land developers. This has helped minimize the kind of financial exposure that has rocked its competitors when real estate prices have dropped. While the value of shares in real estate investment trusts and other property-related stocks took a hit in the early 2020s as the sector weathered the pandemic and post-pandemic economies and rising interest rates, NVR maintained its consistent returns overall. In the early 2000s, NVR experienced significant growth, benefiting from the housing boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. However, the company navigated the housing market downturn better than many of its competitors because of its conservative approach to landowning. Throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s, NVR consistently grew in revenue and earnings as demand for housing increased and interest rates were low, particularly in suburban and exurban areas. Through its well-established Ryan Homes and NVHomes brands, along with its periodic stock repurchases, NVR has built a reputation for consistently delivering impressive financial performance, solidifying its leadership in the homebuilding industry. Monster has grown exponentially over the past two decades, transforming from a small natural beverage company into a global energy drink giant. This success story is fueled by aggressive marketing, strategic partnerships, and a keen understanding of its target market. The company operates through three key segments: Monster energy drinks, which focuses on ready-to-drink energy beverages distributed through bottlers and distributors; strategic brands,which handles the sale of concentrates and beverage bases to bottling operations; and the Other segment, which includes sales by subsidiary American Fruits and Flavors LLC to independent customers. A Depression-era natural soft drink, Monster's transformation into a global energy drink powerhouse began in 2002 with the introduction of the now-iconic Monster Energy drink marked quite a shift for the firm and the wider industry. Riding the wave of rising consumer demand for energy drinks, Monster's aggressive marketing tactics—focusing on extreme sports, music, and youth culture—helped it carve out a significant market share in the highly competitive beverage market. By appealing to a younger demographic with a unique brand image, Monster quickly became a significant competitor to Red Bull, the long-time leader in the energy drink space. The company has extended its energy drink portfolio with new flavors and product lines, including Monster Rehab, Monster Ultra, and Monster Java, each focused on reaching consumers not always likely to grab fluorescent-colored beverages off the shelf of local convenience stores. In 2015, Monster entered into its most important distribution partnership with the Coca-Cola Company (KO), which took a minority stake in the company. This deal not only provided Monster with Coca-Cola’s global distribution network but also allowed Monster to focus on its core energy drink business since Coca-Cola assumed responsibility for the non-energy drink segment of its portfolio. This partnership has been instrumental in Monster's international expansion and has significantly contributed to its growing market share worldwide. Monster has lived up to its name in the investment space. Investopedia noted in 2023 that in the previous 25 years, the company's returns had soundly beaten all comers among those listed on the S&P 500 index. That includes Apple, Amazon, and other tech darlings. Not all has been smooth sailing. The energy drink industry has long faced scrutiny regarding health concerns and potential regulation. Monster also has intense competition for consumer and shelf space from established players like Red Bull and emerging brands in the energy drink market. Meanwhile, Monster has pursued strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enlarge its product offerings and distribution network. In 2023, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. The result was that Monster soon came out with its first alcoholic beverage, the Monster Beast Unleashed, as part of its continuous push into other beverage categories. This includes another partnership with Coca-Cola, formed in early 2024, to develop and commercialize a line of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink tea and coffee beverages. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from a pioneering online bookstore into one of the world’s largest and most influential companies. In the early 2000s, Amazon was primarily known for selling books, music, and DVDs online. Still, its expansion strategy, premised on bringing to other goods the same success and at-home delivery as its first products, has driven its meteoric rise to become a dominant force in ecommerce, cloud computing, logistics, entertainment, and more. Its North American and International segments focus on the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions via region-specific websites. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of cloud computing services for startups, enterprises, governments, and academic institutions. Amazon’s growth was initially fueled by its expanding product catalog and its focus on building a vast, efficient logistics network to support fast delivery. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005 was a key milestone for the company, offering customers unlimited two-day shipping for an annual fee, further strengthening customer loyalty. Beyond retail, one of the most significant developments for Amazon came with the introduction of AWS in 2006. AWS quickly grew into the world’s leading cloud computing platform, providing infrastructure, storage, and computing power to businesses and governments globally. Unknown to most in the public who know the Amazon brand, AWS has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and has become a critical growth engine for the company, consistently contributing a substantial portion of its operating income. Amazon controls about a third of the cloud market worldwide, far more than its competitors, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Amazon’s acquisition strategy has also been instrumental in its growth. Major purchases, including Whole Foods in 2017, allowed Amazon to expand its fledgling grocery business, while its acquisition of Twitch in 2014 strengthened its foothold in the live-streaming and gaming industries. In addition, Amazon Studios and its Prime Video streaming service have become key players in the entertainment space, producing original content and competing with giants like Netflix and Disney. Amazon's stock performance has mirrored its business success, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. In 2021, Amazon joined the elite group of companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, reflecting investor confidence in its diversified business model and long-term prospects. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA designs and manufactures graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. The company operates through several key segments: graphics processing units (GPUs), Tegra processors, and others. Its GPU segment produces the needed chips for significant markets. Its offerings include GeForce brand for gamers, Quadro for designers, and Tesla and DGX systems for AI researchers. The Tegra processor segment integrates GPUs with multi-core CPUs for autonomous machines, gaming consoles, and mobile devices. Initially focused on creating advanced graphics for gaming, NVIDIA helped develop ever newer generations of GPUs, releasing the GeForce 256 in 1999, often cited as the first modern GPU. This invention produced a leap forward for both the gaming and professional graphics industries, enabling faster and more efficient rendering. Nvidia's GPU architecture would later extend to other fields such as AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, solidifying the company’s influence beyond just gaming. When NVIDIA introduced the Geforce 256 in 1999, it was the first widely available GPU. Over the last three decades, Nvidia has diversified its portfolio. The company’s GPUs are now essential in data centers, powering AI applications and machine learning tasks. NVIDIA's role in cloud computing, professional visualization, and the automotive sector has driven extraordinary revenue growth, with its GPUs used in complex simulations, content creation, and cryptocurrency mining. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 increased Nvidia's data center capabilities, adding networking technology to its offerings. Nvidia’s stock had substantial growth in 2023 and 2024, propelled by the demand for AI chips and increased revenue from its data center business. With a significant expansion of partnerships in recent years in cloud computing and AI applications like OpenAI ChatGPT, NVIDIA has cemented the company’s leading role across multiple high-growth sectors. Novice investors should focus on stable, well-established stocks with long-term growth potential. Blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are known for their reliability and consistent returns. In addition, mutual and exchange-traded funds that track market indexes, such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), provide diversified market exposure, reducing risk while capturing broad market performance. There are also long-standing dividend-paying stocks like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola, which offer a steady income stream that appeals to those seeking a combination of growth and income. As of September 2024, the top-performing stocks year-to-date include Vistra Corporation (VST), NVIDIA, and Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG), deliveringimpressive returns of 207%, 147%, and 120%, respectively. From September 1994 to September 2024, the S&P 500 Index achieved an average monthly rate of return of 0.70%, translating into an annualized return of 8.4%. The top-performing stocks over the past 30 years offer a surprising insight: not all the leaders come from the technology sector. While tech giants like NVIDIA and Apple have undeniably driven strong returns, non-tech companies such as Ross Stores, Pool, and Monster have also delivered impressive growth. This highlights the importance of diversification and demonstrates the opportunities in many different sectors, including retail, consumer goods, and distribution. These industries are often overlooked by investors who myopically focus on media-friendly tech stocks. Nevertheless, diversifying across sectors is critical to capturing long-term growth in the market.

Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker looking to compete with the biggest tech firms in the industry like Nvidia (NVDA), filed for an initial public offering (IPO) Monday, with the goal of listing on the Nasdaq under the "CBRS" stock ticker. The company, founded in 2016, has spent the last several years designing chips specifically for AI technology. In its prospectus filed Monday, Cerebras said it has worked to answer the question of how it would design chips if it were starting the design process from scratch. The company says that its design process has led it to create a chip substantially larger than those created by competitors, to avoid the complex process of connecting them and to provide greater on-chip memory and bandwidth. In its prospectus, Cerebras reported a $66.6 million net loss for the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in total revenue, compared with a wider $77.8 million net loss and $8.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2023, as it said associated costs rose substantially year-over-year with increased production. It listed its competition as chipmakers including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC), along with Big Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have begun designing and producing their own AI chips. Cerebras didn't disclose how many shares it intends to offer, or what its IPO price will be, but clearly the potential IPO was announced at a time when companies are looking to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm for the AI industry.

Title: Forget Tech Volatility: ‘Go Global’ With This Steady 8.1% Payer

Background of international currency notes. Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor—especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills. Heck, even if you’re not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold—you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio’s value and book an even bigger income stream going forward. But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn’t the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record. That’s the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK). Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today’s market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it’s all about what lies beneath those dividends. With that in mind, let’s stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with … ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that’s incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone’s talking about today: tech. The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you’ll find in just about any kitchen. As just those samples from the fund’s top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas. Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund 2Q2024 fact sheet This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market. And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too. Now let’s switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite: Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund June 30, 2024, fact sheet You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund’s top holdings read like a who’s who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are. When tech goes up, STK soars—but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK’s performance suffers. Then there’s the volatility. Don’t get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That’s not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts—especially when we look at the price you’ll pay for STK now. As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it’s worth. This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs—it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it’s harder for it to get a lot cheaper). In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you’re paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that’s already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn’t make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time. Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That’s impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that’s built to withstand the market’s ups and downs. ETG’s ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024’s outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector. This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that’s largely because it’s been riding the wave of tech’s explosive growth. While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends.

Title: Five Stocks to Watch in October—and What to Watch For

The major indexes are trading near record highs after the Fed's rate cut fueled a rebound from a shaky start to September. Looking ahead at specific companies, October brings a major product launch from one of the Magnificent Seven and earnings reports from key companies in the tech, banking, and apparel industries. Below, we look at five stocks that could lead market trends—and see big price movements—in October. Tesla (TSLA) will kick off October with third-quarter delivery data early in the month. But investors may watch another event even more closely: a robotaxi launch scheduled for Oct. 10. The event, which CEO Elon Musk has said will be the most important moment for Tesla since it unveiled the Model 3 in 2016, will likely feature a prototype of the robotaxi model, dubbed “Cybercab.” It will also be an opportunity for the automaker to showcase its investments in artificial intelligence and its progress on full self-driving (FSD) software. Analysts have speculated that Tesla stock could get a lift if the company offers aggressive estimates of how quickly it can roll out robotaxis, the size of the market, or its timeline for achieving unsupervised FSD. Tesla stock has risen about 5% so far this year. Microsoft (MSFT) could set the tone for big tech earnings this quarter when it reports mid-month. While the company announced a date just yet, some market watchers expect that its earnings will drop after the bell on Oct. 22, the same day Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) is expected to report. Microsoft is one of four trillion-dollar tech companies—including Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—engaged in an expensive artificial intelligence arms race. Microsoft spent nearly $14 billion on property and equipment in the quarter ended June 30, a 55% increase from the same year-ago period. Much of that spending was on the chips, servers, and other equipment needed to run the company’s AI-powering data centers. Big Tech's spending spooked some corners of Wall Street, which fueled a string of dramatic tech sell-offs in July. Chatter about AI spending has since abated, but Microsoft and its big tech peers have, unlike the broader market, yet to fully rebound from their summer slump. (Still, Microsoft shares are up 14% this year.) Microsoft’s upcoming report has the potential to recast the spotlight on big tech’s spending or give Wall Street a taste of the payoff the company has assured them is coming. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest non-state-owned bank, could give investors a glimpse of what Fed rate cuts mean for American banks when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 11. JPMorgan shares tanked in early September after one executive warned that net interest income (NII), the difference between what the bank earns on loans and what it pays on deposits, was likely to be lower in 2025 than previously forecast. That warning came just days before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, which it is expected to follow up with a string of cuts stretching into next year. Lower interest rates will weigh on JPMorgan’s NII, but they will also take some of the pressure off borrowers who otherwise might have defaulted on loans. Bank of America analysts think banks are better prepared to weather this rate-cutting cycle than any in recent memory. Plus, lower rates in the context of a soft landing—an outcome some economists say is looking increasingly likely—should spur loan demand, reinvigorate mortgage lending, and boost trading activity, all bonuses for banks. The analysts, though, conceded that it's easier to calculate how much rate cuts will reduce NII than how much they’ll boost revenue. JPMorgan’s quarterly results could shed some light on that trade-off and move the stock, which is up 24% since the start of the year. Nike (NKE) will report results for the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year on Oct. 1. and it will be the shoe retailer’s last report before incoming CEO Elliott Hill takes the reins on Oct. 14. The CEO transition marks the beginning of a new phase of Nike’s turnaround efforts. The company has been struggling for some time with sluggish sales in China, once considered its largest growth opportunity, and loss of market share to upstart rivals like On (ONON) and Deckers-owned (DECK) Hoka. Nike shares had their worst day on record after its most recent earnings report in June when the company forecast sales would decline by 10% in the fiscal first quarter. The stock plummeted 20% that day and, even after rebounding slightly, are down some 18% this year. As such, expectations aren’t exactly high heading into October’s report. Deutsche Bank analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect the company to reiterate its full-year guidance and indicate that sales declines had bottomed. “We think a narrative of improvement will be well received,” they wrote, adding that Hill’s appointment gave them confidence the company would refocus on “product innovation, marketing/storytelling, and rebuilding wholesale partnerships.” It has been a wild couple of months for chip giant Intel (INTC). Once the world’s most valuable chipmaker, its shares have shed more than 50% of their value this year as disappointing demand for its foundry services and the high cost of developing AI chips have saddled the company with billions of dollars of losses. Things have looked up a bit in recent weeks. Shares surged in mid-September after the company said it would restructure its foundry business. They were boosted just days later by reports of a possible acquisition by Qualcomm (QCOM) and a $5 billion investment from Apollo Global Management. had approached the company to discuss an acquisition. In October, investors will be looking for more evidence that Intel has the funds, or can raise the funds, to sustain investments in its manufacturing business. Those funds could from the federal government, with which Intel is reportedly working overtime to secure $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding before the end of the year. And some investors may still be hoping for transformational M&A.
