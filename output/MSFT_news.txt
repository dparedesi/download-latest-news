The offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Nvidia (NVDA) stock opened the year at about $50 per share (on a split-adjusted basis). As of late November 2024, the AI hardware giant stock's price had eclipsed $145 — that growth equates to a year-to-date market value increase of almost 195%. When one of the world's largest companies nearly triples in value over 11 months, investors take notice. You might naturally wonder if Nvidia will keep growing and, if so, whether you can benefit. To help you decide if you should invest in Nvidia, let's review key factors from the company's last earnings release and the questions you should consider before placing a buy order. Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year. Learn more: Track Nvidia’s stock price here Notably, Nvidia generated nearly 88% of its revenue from its data center reporting segment, which includes the company's AI computing solutions. Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense. Remember that you can always add to your Nvidia holdings once you become comfortable with its behavior.

In a November 19 Twitter Space discussion hosted by Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck, the Bitcoin maximalist announced that he has agreed to deliver a concise, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s leadership. The pitch comes amidst a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to assess Bitcoin’s potential impact on its balance sheet. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a 3-minute presentation,” Saylor said. “That’s all you’re allowed—and I’m going to present it to the board of directors” A staunch advocate of Bitcoin, Saylor criticized corporations with large cash reserves for “burning shareholder value,” during yesterday's the Twitter space discussion. In his view, Bitcoin can bring great stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky stock if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he stated. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 252,220 BTC valued at $16.8 billion, believes Bitcoin is a necessary asset for companies with large cash reserves. He shared during the discussion that his earlier request for a private meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the topic has not yet been accepted. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 In October, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Twitter, saying, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment on Dec. 10. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) introduced the proposal last month, citing MicroStrategy’s success with Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed Microsoft’s by 313% this year, even though the company operates at a much smaller scale. “MicroStrategy, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, it holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet,” noted NCPPR in the proposal. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal. Microsoft maintains that it already evaluates a broad range of investment options, including Bitcoin. The company’s share price traded relatively modest on Wednesday, increasing 0.49% to $417.79, Google Finance data shows. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.
