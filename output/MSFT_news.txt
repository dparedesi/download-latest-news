We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion. In a note to investors, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he believes Azure growth will begin to reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. “Our checks continue to indicate improving consumption/core cloud trends,” he wrote. “Also, [Microsoft] just announced that ‘OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.’ ” While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, however, says the stock could be set up for a “mini revenge trade” as AI sales increase, its Copilot adoption rate improves, and capital expenditure moderates, creating more free cash flow. Microsoft is also seeking to jump-start PC sales via its Copilot+ PC lineup. The idea is that AI PCs will be able to run AI applications natively rather than via the cloud. But so far, there aren’t very many intriguing scenarios in which those applications make upgrading worthwhile. Hardware updates like improved performance and power are still the main reason consumers want new PCs. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Buy These High Yield CEF Dividends To Hedge Against Market Volatility

investment analysis inflation economic chart With the new administration now in full swing, market events are coming our way at a furious pace, especially for our high yield CEFs. One thing that’s clear about the next few years? Volatility is likely to tick up, especially with stock valuations stretched. Now more than ever, we need to be diversified, so we’re set up to offset any shocks to any one sector while we collect our high closed-end fund dividends. So that’s what we’re going to do today. And CEFs are the best tool to do it. Through just three funds (see tickers below), we’ll give ourselves access to some of the top blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts and high-yield bonds out there. Better still (for safety, as well as income), we’ll get a big slice of our return as dividends, as these three funds pay an 8.8% average yield between them. That’s about seven times what the average S&P 500 stock pays. Plus, these yields are sustainable. To say that this “dividend difference” is a big deal is an understatement. Consider a million-dollar portfolio put into the S&P 500 versus these three funds. That’d get you about $1,008 per month with the index, which no one can live on anymore. But that same amount in this three-fund portfolio gets you $7,333 per month — more than the average monthly paycheck in America. Let’s see how these funds’ high-quality assets help sustain those payouts. Their bargain valuations help out a bit on the dividend front, too. A great place to start is with the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX). I say that because this CEF should appeal to anyone who currently holds an S&P 500 index fund, since its mandate is to buy all of the stocks in that index. That means you’ll get names like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), Bank of America (BAC) and other well-known reliable performers that form the backbone of the economy. They’ve helped SPXX deliver strong long-term gains. At the same time, SPXX yields 7.5%, while S&P 500 index funds yield just around 1.2%. That higher yield comes from two major sources. The first is SPXX’s covered-call-option strategy, in which it sells contracts to investors who pay for the privilege of buying the fund’s stocks at a future date at a predetermined amount. SPXX then hands the cash it receives for selling these option contracts to investors as dividends. Second, SPXX will occasionally sell certain holdings and hand the profits to investors, again in the form of dividends. That means you don’t have to worry about buying or selling your shares to rebalance your position. Just let the income flow your way as the managers do all the work. There’s a third reason why that yield is so big, and that’s one of the really cool things about SPXX and CEFs like it. SPXX trades at a 5.8% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) as I write this, so we’re getting a bargain that ETF buyers simply don’t have access to. This also means that management can pay out that 7.5% dividend, based on the market price of SPXX, while earning just 7.1% from its NAV, or portfolio value. Remember that the S&P 500 has returned 10% per year on average, so that 7.1% profit per year should be easy for SPXX to achieve. The Cohen & Steers Quality Income Realty Fund (RQI) is a real estate focused CEF that I talk about a lot, for a simple reason: Its management has a proven track record of picking the best REITs. Cohen & Steers has 39 years of experience managing real estate assets for clients and manages over $100 billion in assets. RQI’s yield is also 7.5%, which is pretty easy for the fund to deliver, since management’s annualized returns since RQI’s 2002 inception has been 9.1%. RQI trades around the par value of its portfolio now, but there’s a good reason why. Returns from the fund’s portfolio nicely cover its dividend. It also holds REITs from various industries and regions, so we can look at it as a kind of “one-stop shop” for REIT investing. (RQI also holds a small lot of high-yielding preferred shares.) If that weren’t enough, RQI invests in over 200 real estate assets, most of which are stocks in REITs that themselves manage hundreds (or in some cases thousands) of individual properties. Top holdings include cell-tower REIT American Tower (AMT), warehouse giant Prologis (PLD) and data-center landlord Equinix (EQIX). That’s unparalleled diversification, with a leaning toward some of the most in-demand real estate in the US. That gives us extra reassurance as we collect RQI’s 7.5% payout. Now let’s boost the income stream on this “mini-portfolio” with the PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS), whose 11.4% income stream is enormous, but also sustainable. And there’s a simple reason why. High Yield Bond Yields Above we see the average yield for high-yield corporate bonds, which has hovered around 7% since early 2022. Note that Fed rate cuts have pushed that average lower over the last year and a half. This matters for PAXS, a buy recommendation of my CEF Insider service, because the fund invests in bonds similar to those in this index, or “bond-like” assets that are fairly comparable. It has also been collecting that income, which it has been handing over to investors as cash dividends. Since the average effective maturity for the bonds in PAXS’s portfolio is now 6.3 years, that means it’s effectively secured bonds at these high yields to fund payments to investors for many years to come. But you might be thinking, that’s 7%, which is far below the 11.4% PAXS pays out. While that’s true, remember that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates over those six years, which will boost the value of PAXS’ bonds (since they pay out more than newly issued bonds would). As that happens, PAXS can sell those bonds at a profit and hand that over to investors as dividends. Now this fund does trade at a slight premium (3.4%) to NAV, but that’s actually a bargain for a fund from PIMCO, which is a revered name among CEF investors. PIMCO funds often trade at premiums—and those premiums regularly stretch into double digits. These three funds together get us an 8.8%-yielding portfolio with a nice mix of stocks, bonds and REITs. And since you can buy all three of these CEFs through any stock brokerage (CEFs are bought and sold like stocks over exchanges like the NYSE), this is an easy way to diversify across hundreds of assets all at once.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? What to Know About the Chinese AI Startup That Spurred a Stock Selloff

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).
