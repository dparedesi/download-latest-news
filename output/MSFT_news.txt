ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

Title: 6 Top ETFs To Buy To Diversify Beyond The S&P 500
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-etfs-buy-diversify-beyond-sp500/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. An S&P 500 ETF may have been your first investing pick, but it shouldn’t be your last. While the large-cap S&P 500 index has made its share of millionaires, it is increasingly dominated by only a few companies. The top 10 S&P 500 stocks comprise nearly 38% of the index, while the remaining 62% is split among 490 companies. Diversifying outside the S&P 500 reduces concentration risk and provides other avenues of growth beyond Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The funds introduced here can achieve both goals. Read on to meet the largest and most popular funds in market segments that have little to no overlap with the S&P 500. The table below identifies the six best ETFs to buy to diversify beyond the S&P 500. A closer review of each fund follows. Metrics for current share prices and distribution yields are sourced from stockanalysis.com. Returns, composition metrics, expense ratios and net asset values are from fund websites. IJR by the numbers: IJR invests in small-cap stocks, which have market capitalizations ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. The fund's largest industry exposures are financials (19.5%), industrials (19.3%) and consumer discretionary (13.9%). The top three holdings are loan servicer Mr. Cooper, aerospace technology provider Kratos Defense & Security and rare minerals producer MP Materials. IJR has zero overlap with the S&P 500. With 632 holdings, the fund is also well-diversified within the small-cap segment. Some analysts are bullish on small caps for 2025, citing appealing valuations, a positive regulatory environment and increasing merger and acquisition activity. Small caps are also likely to have lower tariff risk, since they normally focus on domestic business for growth. Small caps can be volatile, so most investors will not use IJR as a core fund. A reasonable starting allocation would be 5% to 15%. IJH by the numbers: IJH invests in mid-cap companies, which have market values of $2 billion to $10 billion. Similar to IJR, the portfolio favors industrials (23.7%), financials (18%) and consumer discretionary (13.3%) stocks. The top three holdings are digital investment broker Interactive Brokers Group, construction service provider Emcor Group and HVAC contractor Comfort Systems USA. None of the 404 stocks in the IJH portfolio are in the S&P 500. Information technology, the sector that dominates the S&P 500, comprises just 11.9% of IJH. The 2025 outlook for mid caps is also positive, for the same reasons small caps are poised to shine. However, mid caps are larger and more established than small caps. Their larger size may provide better business visibility, financial resilience and capital access relative to their smaller counterparts. A 5% to 15% allocation to mid caps is appropriate for many investors. You might lean to the higher side of the range if you decide to forgo small-cap exposure. VNQ by the numbers: Vanguard’s real estate ETF invests in real estate investment trusts (REIT). REITs are companies that own and manage real estate. They pay no corporate taxes and distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. VNQ's primary exposures are to property owners in health care (13.7%), retail (13.2%) and telecom towers (11.50%). The top three holdings are Vanguard's institutional real estate fund VRTPX, senior housing operator Welltower and industrial property owner Prologis. Thirty-one of VNQ’s 160 holdings are in the S&P 500, including Welltower and Prologis. In terms of weight, the overlap is low. For example, Welltower is 6.1% of VNQ but only 0.2% of the S&P 500. REITs make their money on real estate values and rents, two values that generally hold up well in inflationary periods. So it’s not surprising that a 2022 analysis by industry group NAREIT concluded that REITs outperform the S&P 500 in high-inflation periods. This means VNQ exposure could partly offset the next inflation-related downturn in stocks. REITs should be a non-core holding with an allocation of 5% to 15%. VXUS by the numbers: VXUS invests in small-, mid- and large-cap stocks located outside the U.S., with exposure to Europe (39%), emerging markets (27.2%), the Pacific (25.4%) and North America (7.7%). The top holdings are chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor, online advertising and content company Tencent Holdings and enterprise software provider SAP. VXUS has no overlap with the S&P 500. Finance is the most heavily weighted sector in VXUS, while the S&P 500 is concentrated in technology. VXUS has outperformed S&P 500 ETFs this year, notching a 22.7% gain vs. 10.4% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Schwab is upbeat about international stocks for the remainder of 2025, partly due to their attractive valuations and weakness in the U.S. dollar. International stocks can comprise 20% to 30% of your portfolio. BND by the numbers: BND invests in taxable, investment-grade bonds issued in U.S. dollars. About 80% of the portfolio has maturities ranging from one to 10 years, and the portfolio may be moderately price-sensitive to interest rates. Bond types include Treasury securities (48.9%), government mortgage-backed securities (19.6%) and corporate industrial bonds (14.4%). BND provides broad exposure to the U.S. bond market, which can add stability and income to a portfolio otherwise focused on the S&P 500. Bonds can fluctuate in value, but they’re generally less reactive than stock prices. They can also move in the opposite direction of stocks, rising when investors sour on equities. The right bond allocation depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. If your goal is to preserve your wealth—say, because you are retired—you might want 40% to 60% exposure to bonds. If you're young and interested in long-term growth, a 10% to 20% allocation is more appropriate. GLD by the numbers: GLD invests in physical gold bullion. Shareholders participate in gold spot price changes, less fund expenses, without having to buy, store and insure their own gold bars. Gold is a safe-haven asset that tends to appreciate during periods of high inflation and economic uncertainty—circumstances that often coincide with stock price declines. The precious metal has performed very well recently, increasing more than 35% over the last 12 months. Some analysts believe the run will continue. In June 2025, J.P. Morgan predicted gold’s price could reach $3,675 per ounce in the fourth quarter and nearly $4,000 in mid-2026. Gold futures contracts currently trade just below $3,400. According to State Street Global Advisors, 83% of advisors recommend a gold allocation of 10% or more. Surveyed high-net-worth investors had an average gold allocation of 21% in 2024. Bottom Line The S&P 500 has made headlines for its performance in recent years, but it's not the only game in town. Adding small- and mid-caps, international stocks, REITs, bonds or gold to your portfolio provides multiple pathways to growth, plus some cushion if large caps weaken.
