Tesla (TSLA) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

VANCOUVER, BC, May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – A new report from Philips reveals a growing divide between doctors and patients when it comes to AI in healthcare. While 63% of surveyed healthcare professionals believe AI can help improve outcomes, only 48% of patients share that optimism. As researchers explore what's needed for successful AI adoption in healthcare, major players in tech and biotech are already moving ahead—recent updates have come from Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Renovaro Inc. (NASDAQ: RENB), Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ: CERT), CareCloud, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCLD), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), in partnership with Ainnova Tech, is positioning its Vision AI platform at the forefront of predictive healthcare. The company is in advanced discussions to acquire or exclusively license a patented early disease detection technology that could significantly enhance its diagnostic capabilities. If finalized, the deal would allow Vision AI to generate clinical insights even in the absence of a complete patient dataset—unlocking earlier intervention opportunities and supporting a more proactive model of care. "Our purpose is to create the future of early disease detection in an accessible way, so that patients can get a preventive check-up anywhere, at a low cost, and easily," said Vinicio Vargas, CEO at Ainnova and member of the Board of Directors of the joint venture company, Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), said of AAC's aim to continue to add to its portfolio. "We want to prevent patients with risk factors from developing other diseases that could have been avoided before they became a real problem. To this end, we are seeking to integrate new technologies into our portfolio within a single platform, both through our R&D efforts and through potential exclusive licenses or acquisitions." The potential acquisition aligns with Avant and Ainnova's shared mission to deliver scalable, preventive health tools that merge retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine learning into one streamlined platform. Vision AI is already positioned as a next-generation diagnostic engine for chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney dysfunction. Now, the joint venture is pushing further—evaluating breakthrough technologies that could detect emerging health issues at a pre-symptomatic stage. Recent platform updates saw four proprietary algorithms—trained on over 2.3 million real-world clinical cases—fully integrated into Vision AI. The addition of new IP from this proposed deal would mark a significant leap forward, enabling predictive models to extract meaningful signals from even limited patient data. Avant and Ainnova view this initiative as part of a broader strategy to consolidate breakthrough tools that make early disease detection more scalable, mobile, and applicable across diverse healthcare settings. While a final agreement has yet to be announced, the companies have stated they will keep shareholders informed as developments progress. In parallel, Avant has entered formal discussions to acquire Ainnova outright—building on their existing alignment under the Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC) structure. The timing is deliberate, coming just ahead of a planned FDA pre-submission meeting this July. A completed merger would unify operations, reduce internal complexity, and bolster the joint venture's regulatory readiness as it prepares for potential U.S. market entry. "We believe bringing the two companies together will offer tremendous value for shareholders," said Vargas. "It will simplify the process of advancing our technology to market, and it will deliver value to our customers and partners as we promote our technology portfolio globally." At the center of this initiative is Vision AI—a non-invasive screening platform that integrates retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine-learning models to flag early indicators of chronic disease. The system targets conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular issues, kidney and liver disorders, and type 2 diabetes. Operated under the AAC structure, the joint venture holds global rights to Vision AI, which has demonstrated over 90% sensitivity in early detection based on research cited by the NIH. "This milestone reflects our two-tiered strategy, rapid deployment in low-regulation markets where Vision AI operates as a screening tool, and simultaneous progress toward FDA clearance for the U.S. market," said Vargas. "Entering the U.S. will unlock significant commercial potential, and early engagement with regulators ensures we do so with speed, credibility, and a validated product." While many AI healthcare platforms remain stuck in pilot stages, Avant's Vision AI is already live across multiple Latin American markets—including Chile, Mexico, and Brazil—where it's actively being used in clinical settings. These real-world deployments are generating essential data on safety and efficacy, while also providing user feedback that guides ongoing system improvements. To broaden its diagnostic reach, the Ai-nova joint venture recently integrated four additional algorithms into the platform. Each was trained on a dataset of more than 2.3 million clinical records, enhancing Vision AI's precision across a wider spectrum of chronic diseases. With active momentum abroad and U.S. regulatory discussions now underway, Avant's trajectory appears to be moving from early validation toward broader market penetration. CONTINUED...

"We're setting a new bar for how AI can be responsibly and effectively deployed in clinical and experimental settings." The platform has already demonstrated early success in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, with expansion plans underway for additional neurological conditions. Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ: CERT) has launched its Non-Animal Navigator™ solution to help drug developers reduce reliance on animal testing, aligning with the FDA's Roadmap to Reducing Animal Testing in Preclinical Safety Studies. "The FDA announcement and roadmap pave the way for more model-informed drug development approaches that are predictive, efficient, and ethical," said William F. Feehery, CEO of Certara Inc. "It is part of a growing industry adoption trend to use scientifically robust new approach methodologies (NAMs) like AI-enabled biosimulation to improve strategic decision-making and success rates at every phase of drug development." The new offering combines strategic regulatory guidance with AI-enabled biosimulation, providing an ethical and efficient pathway through early-stage drug development. With adoption already underway, Certara's platform offers a future-ready model for companies advancing biologics, including monoclonal antibodies and ADCs. CareCloud, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCLD) has been named Maxim Group's "Top Healthcare IT Pick for 2025," with analysts citing the company's AI-first strategy, strong financial performance, and discounted valuation as key drivers. "AI is now deeply integrated into our operations—from documentation and revenue cycle management to patient engagement and analytics," said Hadi Chaudhry, Co-CEO of CareCloud Inc. "This is not an add-on, it is a foundational capability that is changing how healthcare is delivered and experienced." The firm recently launched its AI Center of Excellence and introduced purpose-built tools like cirrusAI Notes and cirrusAI Voice to streamline clinical workflows and improve patient engagement. CareCloud plans to scale its AI team from 50 to 500 by year-end, deepening its role as a leader in applied healthcare AI. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has introduced its healthcare agent orchestrator—a multi-agent AI framework designed to support complex clinical workflows, such as tumor boards, by analyzing multimodal data across imaging, genomics, and electronic health records. "The vision of the healthcare agent orchestrator is to rapidly surface, summarize, and take action on relevant multimodal medical information for each complex cancer case, so hours of review can become minutes," said Dr. Joshua Warner, Radiologist at UW Health and Assistant Professor of Radiology, UW School of Medicine and Public Health. "Collaborating with Microsoft allows us to explore the value of these models for tumor boards and beyond." Now available through Azure AI Foundry, the system enables clinicians and developers to coordinate specialized AI agents directly within Microsoft Teams and Office tools, streamlining hours of expert analysis into minutes. Leading institutions like Stanford, Johns Hopkins, and Providence are already piloting the technology to accelerate cancer diagnosis, clinical trial matching, and treatment planning.

Title: Bill Gates Could've Been The Worlds First Trillionaire
URL: https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2025/05/bill-gates-couldve-been-worlds-first.html
Time Published: 2025-05-22T20:30:00Z
Full Content:
I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Bill Gates is one of the founders of software giant Microsoft (MSFT). Before Microsoft went public in 1986, he held 11,222,000 shares in the company. He owned 49.20% of it. He sold a portion of his stake at the IPO, and has been regularly and consistently been reducing his stake in Microsoft for the past 38 years. This is how the stock price did since the IPO: Many of the funds have been allocated through his private family office, and have been diversified away. Much of the funds have also found their way to his charitable arm, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has worked on eradicating a variety of issues around the world (e.g. polio). The money has done a lot of good. It's still fascinating to think about how much this stake would have been worth, had he not sold anything, and kept all shares. For the sake of simplicity, I would assume that all dividends received were not reinvested. Otherwise, the numbers get even higher, but messier too. While his ownership of the float would have likely remained around 50%, after accounting for issuance of stock options and restricted stock units to employees, with dividends reinvested he could've been in a hypotetical situation where his ownership is more than 100%. Which of course is impossible. You can view the trend in shares outstanding for Microsoft between 1990 and 2025 here (adjusted for stock splits): The stock has gone through nine stock splits since its IPO in 1986. This also means that his 11,222,000 shares from 1986 would have turned to 3,231,936,000 shares today. At the current share price of $455/share, this translates into a net worth of almost $1.5 trillion dollars. This means that Bill Gates would have been the world's first trillionaire. He would have also been richer than the richest people in the world today. These are the four richest people in the world today, according to Forbes: Instead, he's worth "only" $115 billion today, and is number 12 on the list of the world's richest people. Of course, this is mostly a discussion with a lot of hindsight bias. Back in 1986, Bill Gates did not really know how the next 38 years would unfold. It could have been very likely that Microsoft did not survive or if it did, it did not deliver the amazing returns it did. In general, it makes sense to diversify your investments in order to protect yourself from unknown risks. It's also a good idea to give back and help those in need. My take-away from this story is that I should keep my winners for as long as possible, and not diworsify away any potential. While I start my strategy with a diversified exposure to a large group of entities that fit my criteria, I do believe that the key to building long-term wealth is to let winners run. When auditing my investment decisions, I realized that selling too early was one of my biggest mistakes. In other words, you want to water the flowers and cut the weeds. If you sell out those future wealth builders too early, you may not make a lot of money in your strategy overall. Since you do not really know which of your portfolio holdings will be the best performing ones over the next 40 years, it makes sense to avoid too much turnover and selling them prematurely. Higher turnover is associated with a higher potential for making a mistake, and increasing costs. That being said, it's also good to have some diversification as well. After all, things could have gone wrong for his net worth, if Microsoft had not performed as it did. The company had to work hard to endure the changes in the business and tech world for decades, and thrive as well. But as we all know, different paths could have led to different outcomes as well.

May 19, 2025 16:11 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares announced today that it will close and liquidate the following ETF: On May 09, 2025, the board of GraniteShares ETF Trust approved the liquidation of the GraniteShares 1x Short AMD Daily ETF (the “ETF”). The last day of trading for the ETF on NASDAQ Stock Market will be June 20, 2025. The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 18, 2025. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 20, 2025. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 20, 2025, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 23, 2025. When the ETF commences the liquidation of its portfolio, it may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the ETF’s investment objectives and strategies. At the time the liquidation of the ETF is complete, the ETF shares will be individually redeemed. For shareholders that still hold shares of the ETF as of June 20, 2025, shares will be automatically redeemed for cash at the net asset value as of close of business on that date, which will reflect the costs of closing the ETF. Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss on the redemptions. The ETF may or may not pay one or more dividends or other distributions prior to or along with the redemption payments. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares will continue to offer the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: Contact Information:William Rhind, CEO GraniteShares Inc +1 646 876 5049 william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.
