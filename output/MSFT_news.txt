Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Title: Chrome Worth $1 Trillion For Google?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/13/chrome-worth-1-trillion-for-google/
Time Published: 2025-08-13T09:00:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. How much is Chrome worth to Google? Perplexity AI says it’s worth $34.5 billion. We think that’s perplexing. Maybe it was a product of its own AI engine’s hallucination. Consider 3 facts to start: Google search brought in $265 billion in revenue over the last twelve months. Sure, Perplexity is so generously offering Google search to continue to be the 'default’ engine, for now. But that could change if Perplexity decides later. Who knows. Point is, why would Google want to sell access – literally the starting point to more than half the world’s population – for a pittance? Of course, the answer is – if forced by a judge. With such massive regulatory uncertainty hanging over Google, investors naturally worry about the stock’s volatility. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has comfortably outperformed its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. On a separate note, check out – ETH Price To $10,000? When Perplexity floated that $34.5 billion figure, it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of Chrome’s true value proposition. Recent assessment puts Chrome’s standalone worth at up to $50 billion,[1] but even that figure misses the forest for the trees. Chrome isn’t just a browser - it's Google's gateway to digital dominance. Think about it this way: Chrome controls the digital journey for 3.5 billion users. Every search query, every ad impression, every data point collected starts with that familiar Chrome interface. You can't put a price tag on owning the front door to the internet. Perplexity’s $34.5 billion valuation suggests they’re treating Chrome like any other tech asset – maybe factoring in user base, revenue attribution and development costs. But that’s exactly where they went wrong. Chrome serves as Google's strategic choke point, drawing users into the Google ecosystem the moment they open the browser. Its address bar funnels search queries directly to Google, while deep integration with Google accounts creates a seamless experience across search, email, and other productivity tools. This isn't just about market share; it's about controlling how billions of people access and interact with the internet, solidifying Google's dominance. Perplexity seems to have missed this entirely. They’re valuing Chrome as if it’s a standalone product when it’s actually the master key to Google’s $2.4 trillion empire. For a deeper dive into how Google’s market position translates to valuation metrics, see our take on Google’s Valuation Comparison. The ongoing DOJ antitrust proceedings have created a nightmare scenario for Google that goes far beyond the $34.5 billion price tag being discussed. The regulatory pressures are mounting from multiple directions – also look at our take on Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit – but the Chrome divestiture represents the most immediate existential threat. If Google is forced to divest Chrome, the company faces risks that make Perplexity’s bid look like pocket change. Losing Chrome means losing the behavioral insights that power Google’s $250+ billion advertising machine. Without direct access to browsing patterns, Google's ability to build detailed user profiles and command premium advertising rates gets severely compromised. A new Chrome owner could switch default search providers overnight, potentially redirecting billions of queries to competitors like Microsoft’s Bing or emerging AI-powered search alternatives. Google's guaranteed access to 3.5 billion users vanishes instantly. Chrome users generate higher-value advertising interactions than users from other browsers. They search more frequently and in ways that are more profitable for Google’s advertising model. Different ownership could disrupt this entire revenue stream. Google Workspace loses its competitive edge over Microsoft Office 365 without Chrome’s tight integration. What’s currently a seamless ecosystem becomes fragmented web applications fighting for user attention. This couldn’t come at a worse time for Google, as Microsoft has been gaining ground on multiple fronts. In fact, Microsoft itself has been riding on a high note – see our take on MSFT Stock to $1,000? Chrome provides real-time insights into how users interact with AI search features and behavioral data necessary to train better AI models. Without this testing ground, Google can’t iterate quickly on AI search improvements or seamlessly integrate new AI capabilities. The most terrifying scenario? New owners could actively promote competing services, block Google integrations, or turn Chrome into a distribution channel for Google's rivals. So while Perplexity and other observers throw around valuations like $34.5 billion or $50 billion, they’re missing the fundamental point. Chrome’s value to Google isn’t measurable in traditional financial metrics because it’s not a standalone business – it’s the foundation upon which Google’s entire digital empire rests. Understanding this foundational role is crucial for grasping Google's growth trajectory – for more on this, see our take on Alphabet's Path To 2x Growth. The real question isn’t what Chrome is worth, but what Google becomes without it. The answer is uncomfortable for Google shareholders: a search engine company that's suddenly competing on a level playing field, without guaranteed access to billions of users, without seamless ecosystem integration, and without the data advantages that have powered its dominance for over two decades. That’s not a $34.5 billion problem. That's an existential crisis. For investors wrestling with whether such regulatory risks make Google a buy or avoid, see our analysis on Buy or Fear Google Stock. Understanding these complex regulatory and competitive dynamics is exactly why comprehensive risk assessment matters in investment decisions. Regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: This ‘Buffett Favorite’ Dividend Is An Incredible CEF Bargain (For Now)

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. When it comes to a closed-end fund (CEF), many investors are always focused on one thing: the dividend. It makes sense: CEFs pay 8.5% yields, on average, according to data from my CEF Insider service. But sometimes it pays to look beyond those big payouts, because by doing so, you could find a CEF with a track record so strong that its total return (dividends and gains combined) beats that of a CEF with a high yield. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to take more of my return in the form of price gains if it means, say, doubling my money in five years! That’s been the case with the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), whose dividend—at 3.8%—is pretty, well, meh, for a CEF. As a result, it’s often overlooked, which is what’s happening now. We can see that in the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which is just under 20% today (more on this shortly). That ridiculous discount is an insult to this proven fund, which has doubled an investor’s money, with dividends reinvested, in the last half-decade. That’s a fantastic return by any measure. It even beat the S&P 500, which is up around 103% since then. The funny thing is, the strategy behind this money-making fund is simple, which is why its bargain valuation is so surprising. Inspired by Warren Buffett, STEW uses a value-investing approach that makes the fund less volatile than the broader market while helping it rise in value over the long haul. Its largest investment is in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which is about 45% of the fund’s assets. Additionally, STEW looks for valuable underpriced stocks, which is why it also holds JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Microsoft (MSFT) and other high-quality firms with long histories of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This is all good stuff, but now let me show you the best part: that bargain valuation I mentioned a second ago. This is where a big difference between CEFs and ETFs comes in: ETFs can issue shares as necessary, so they don’t trade at discounts (or at least significant ones). But STEW, as a CEF, has a fixed number of shares (hence the “closed” in the term “closed-end fund”). As a result, a CEF’s shares can trade up or down depending on market demand, in addition to their movements on the value of the fund’s assets. That, in turn, means CEFs can sometimes trade well below NAV. And STEW’s discount, as I mentioned a second ago, is truly massive: just under 20%! Note that this markdown was even wider in recent months. In fact, STEW’s discount has slowly grown larger over the last five years despite the fact that the fund beat the market. This inefficiency can’t last, which is why STEW’s discount suddenly shrank in recent weeks. Its discount is likely to shrink further as more investors catch on. All of this might sound familiar if you’ve been reading my articles for a while, because in a March 31, 2025, piece, I pointed out that STEW’s massive (then 23.1%) discount was unlikely to last. It has shrunk a bit since then, and I see it shrinking more. Now, let me wheel back to the dividend part of the picture here. To be sure, that 3.8% payout is, as mentioned, on the small side for a CEF. But it’s also masking something else, besides STEW’s strong total return: dividend growth. That too has been strong, with the payout soaring 62% in the last five years. And lately, STEW’s payout growth has been accelerating: It’s just another reason why with CEFs (or any income investment, really), it pays to look beyond the yield. STEW, with its discount, performance history and growing payout, is a perfect example of that. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

U.S. stock market is heading into one of the most important weeks of the year as investors await the July CPI report and a critical U.S.–China tariff decision. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are near record highs, while the Nasdaq Composite keeps setting fresh milestones, fueled by strong tech earnings and AI optimism. But with inflation risks, high valuations, and trade uncertainty looming, analysts warn that the rally could face sudden turbulence. Tuesday’s CPI data and the tariff truce deadline may decide whether Wall Street’s summer surge continues—or if markets shift to a more cautious, volatile phase.
