Title: The US Consumer Is Healthy And This 10% Dividend Will Profit

Strengthening and building your savings Last year, the White House published a blog post titled “As the US Consumer Goes, So Goes the US Economy.” No matter what your politics are, I think we can all agree that America’s economy depends on consumers buying things. For us income investors, then, the consumer’s health is a key thing to watch, as it ultimately sets the direction of stocks. So how healthy is the US consumer today, and can we confidently buy stocks—and better still, high-yielding CEFs like the one we’ll talk about below (current yield: 10%)? Often, the signals are murky. America is, after all, a big country with a lot of people in it, and some of those people are obviously doing better than others, so it’s tricky to zero in on the overall health of consumers. Still, there are some things every consumer is sensitive to and, ultimately, will affect everyone’s spending. The biggest variable, as you can likely guess, is inflation. Inflation/SPY In 2021, as we all know well, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (in orange above) started climbing. That caused stocks to tank in 2022, as spiraling prices of everyday things forced pretty well everyone, no matter how rich, to cut back to varying degrees. But see how the orange line kept going down? The CPI is now back around pre-pandemic levels. With that in mind, you’d expect US consumers to boost their spending again. And they have. Fun Spending This is an obscure metric, but it’s important: how much Americans spend on recreation services (think movie tickets, concerts, hotels, amusement parks and such). After the pandemic slump, inflation slowed the recovery to the pre-pandemic trendline in 2021 and 2022. Growth recovered in 2023 and has kept strengthening so far in 2024. In short, Americans have more money to spend on fun because 2022’s inflationary pressures have started to ebb. Here’s another interesting chart on the health of the consumer: Household Debt/Income What this shows us is that, if you take the average US household and count up its debt, the total amounts to less than 100% of their disposable (or after-tax) income. In other words, putting 100% of that income toward their debt could erase their borrowings in less than a year (which is obviously impossible but useful for context here). Contrast that with other wealthy nations, like Canada and Australia, where households would need a year and 10 months. Combine healthy US household balance sheets and higher spending on recreation and it’s hard to conclude that, generally speaking, the US consumer is anything but healthy. A strong consumer means a strong economy and strong corporate earnings. That, in turn, translates to larger returns to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In 2023, S&P 500 firms spent over $800 billion buying back shares from investors, while giving them over $500 billion in cash dividends. You can be one of the people getting a “paycheck” from companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V) when you invest in an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ). But don’t expect that to turn into a big cash flow overnight. With SPY yielding just 1.2%, even a million dollars in this fund won’t replace more than $1,000 per month in income—hardly a living wage! But we can speed that up without sacrificing quality if we instead buy a fund like the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), one of my favorite closed-end funds (CEFs). USA invests in US mid-cap and large-cap firms: Its portfolio holds Apple, Microsoft, Visa and many other top S&P 500 names. While its holdings resemble those of SPY, its dividend does not. USA turns gains and dividends from the stocks it holds into an income stream for investors, which is how it can pay out a far bigger dividend than SPY: 10%, to be exact. Based on USA’s yield (note that its payout does fluctuate a bit, based on the fund’s portfolio returns), a million-dollar portfolio now pays $8,333 averaged out on a monthly basis—higher than the average American’s paycheck. But will the income stream hold? A 10% yield seems unrealistically high, which is why a lot of people scoff when I show them facts like these. So let’s look at history. USA Dividend USA’s payout has steadily risen with the stock market over the last decade. As long as consumers have money to spend, giving companies revenue they can translate into profits for their shareholders, USA will be able to pump that dividend number up further. Finally, let’s talk about USA’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio). As I write this, the fund trades just a hair over par. While we prefer discounted CEFs, that’s reasonable for USA, given its strong management and outsized yield. We’ve also seen the fund trade at healthy premiums (north of 4%) as recently as July 2023. Nonetheless, if you prefer to buy at a discount, I get it. In that case, go ahead and put USA on your watch list. Given the fund’s very slight premium, it wouldn’t take much to push it back into discount territory. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Reddit Inc (RDDT) Gains ‘Buy’ Rating from Jefferies With $90 Price Target Amid AI-Driven Growth and Strong User Engagement

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A content marketing website showing the audience reach of the company's products. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and forum social network. The company has been enhancing its AI capabilities by acquiring Memorable AI, following a partnership announcement with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT). These moves reflect its commitment to integrating advanced AI technologies into its offerings. On October 9, 2024, Jefferies analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a “Buy” rating and a price target of $90. According to the firm, this valuation is based on $65 per share for Advertising and $25 per share for Data Licensing. “RDDT is combining AI-driven product enhancements with a robust archive of contextual content to spur trial and engagement, resulting in recent user growth accelerating to the highest level in 2+ years,” -Analysts said in a note. The company’s growth can be attributed to its deeper integration with Google search and the launch of a faster Web platform. Investments in AI and machine learning have enhanced recommendation algorithms, further improving user experience and increasing logged-in users. Jefferies also notes how RDDT’s extensive database of user-generated content has garnered the interest of third-party developers of generative AI models, securing approximately $325 million in non-exclusive contract licensing revenue over the next three years. “We believe expanding use-cases for Gen AI over time will attract new partnerships, resulting in additional high margin revenue streams and upside to consensus”. -Jefferies analysts Overall RDDT ranks 17th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of RDDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Microsoft Stock Earnings: Is It A Buy Before Or After Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/microsoft-msft-stock-earnings-is-it-buy-before-after-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T20:20:23Z

Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report its earnings soon, and investors are keen to see if the tech giant will continue its trend of strong financial performance. With consistent earnings beats in recent quarters and steady stock price growth, it’s worth asking if now is the right time to buy before or after the company’s earnings report. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s historical earnings, recent performance and factors to consider ahead of its report. Over the past eight quarters, Microsoft has demonstrated impressive earnings performance, beating estimates every time for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, except for a single revenue miss. The company has consistently surprised to the upside, with significant EPS beats like 12.9% in first-quarter 2024 and a notable revenue beat of nearly $2 billion during the same period. The strength in Microsoft’s earnings history highlights a pattern of outperforming market expectations, building investor confidence in its financial reliability. These consistent surprises, including a 5.8% EPS beat in fiscal second-quarter 2024, suggest that Microsoft’s earnings reports tend to favorably surprise analysts, which could be a signal for bullish investors looking for an edge. Microsoft’s stock performance has been solid despite market volatility. In the past month, MSFT stock has seen a slight dip of 4.4%, but year to date, it remains up by 12.2%. Over the past year, the stock has gained 25.3%, reflecting its resilience and growth. Microsoft’s five-year performance is remarkable, boasting a 202.8% increase. If Microsoft continues its growth trajectory, discussions around whether Microsoft stock can reach $1,000 could gain traction. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus recommendation to buy and a price target range from $420 to $600, well above the current share price of $418.74. This aligns with Microsoft’s strong business fundamentals, including a gross margin of 69.8% and an impressive operating margin of 44.6%.

Before diving into the specifics of the earnings, it's crucial to consider various factors that could impact Microsoft's performance. Economic conditions, competitive pressures and evolving market dynamics all play a significant role in shaping results. Investors should also keep an eye on the overall tech sector's health, particularly in relation to AI and cloud computing, where Microsoft has established a strong foothold. Microsoft is expected to continue its strong financial performance. The consensus EPS forecast for the next quarter is 13.15, with estimates ranging between 12.74 and 13.86. On the revenue side, analysts expect $279.21 billion, reflecting Microsoft’s robust revenue growth of 15.7% year over year. These high expectations from analysts show optimism but also set the bar high for the upcoming report. The broader market conditions play a crucial role in Microsoft’s stock performance, especially with the tech sector facing some headwinds recently. Investors should consider the macroeconomic factors impacting tech stocks, including interest rates and inflation, which could introduce volatility around the earnings report. Microsoft’s focus on AI, cloud computing and its growth in enterprise software positions it well for future growth. Recent news includes its strategic partnerships and investments in AI, which could boost future revenue. Microsoft's 0.8% dividend yield and consistent payout add value for long-term investors. Microsoft’s focus on AI also aligns it with other top AI stocks that are poised for growth. Just as Nvidia stock has benefitted from advancements in AI, Microsoft is also expected to capitalize on similar trends. As the scheduled earnings date of October 30 approaches, several key metrics will be vital in evaluating Microsoft's performance. These include trends in semiconductor shortages that could affect production, memory chip pricing and any supply chain disruptions that may have occurred. Given the increasing reliance on technology across sectors, understanding these elements will provide deeper insights into Microsoft's revenue and profitability. Revenue growth remains a key metric for Microsoft. In the previous quarter, Microsoft’s revenue grew by 3.6%, with actual revenue coming in at $56.5 billion, beating estimates by nearly $2 billion. For the upcoming earnings, investors will focus on whether Microsoft can sustain or exceed its growth trajectory, particularly given its expansion into AI and cloud computing. With an operating margin of 44.6% and a gross margin of 69.8%, Microsoft’s profitability is another critical aspect of the earnings report. Investors will watch for any changes in operating income, especially given its strong Ebitda growth of 26.7% year over year, as it reflects the company’s operational efficiency.

The strength of Microsoft’s customer base in key areas like Azure and enterprise software will be pivotal. The company has managed to grow its earnings per share by 21.9% year over year, which ties directly to its expanding customer base. A continuation of this trend would be a positive signal for long-term growth. Guidance is an essential part of the earnings report, offering insights into the company’s outlook. Microsoft typically provides projections that help investors assess the company’s growth trajectory. Analyzing this guidance helps investors understand the management's expectations and can significantly influence MSFT stock movement. If guidance exceeds market expectations, it could indicate robust future performance, whereas conservative projections may raise concerns. Deciding when to invest in Microsoft stock surrounding earnings reports is a critical consideration for investors. Buying before earnings can lead to significant gains if the report exceeds expectations. However, this strategy also comes with risks, including increased volatility. Conversely, purchasing after earnings allows for a more informed decision based on actual performance, yet it may result in missing out on potential price jumps. Buying before earnings can offer opportunities for early positioning and potential gains if the results are positive. However, this approach carries the risk of heightened volatility, as stocks can react sharply to earnings surprises. Additionally, investors may find themselves acting on limited information, which can lead to poor decision-making if expectations are not met. Pros Cons Purchasing after earnings presents its advantages, as it allows investors to make decisions based on actual performance rather than speculation. This can reduce the risk of significant losses if the stock reacts poorly to the earnings report. However, waiting until after the earnings release could mean missing out on a rally if the stock jumps in response to strong results. Furthermore, the market may overreact, leading to corrections or rebounds that savvy investors might miss. Pros Cons Investor sentiment plays a major role in stock price movement around earnings reports. Microsoft’s history of beating earnings estimates often fuels bullish sentiment, but the broader market sentiment, particularly in the tech sector, can introduce volatility. A positive outlook from the market can bolster MSFT stock prices, while negative sentiment may result in a downturn. Analysts often emphasize the need to understand how investor psychology interacts with earnings results, as this can lead to exaggerated reactions, impacting the stock's short-term performance. Understanding the pulse of market reactions before and after the report is crucial for timing your investment. Experts consistently view Microsoft as a solid investment, particularly with its expansion into AI and cloud computing. As the earnings report approaches, expert opinions become invaluable. Analysts provide context and insights that can shape investor expectations. By examining expert assessments, investors can gain a clearer picture of how Microsoft's performance aligns with broader market trends. This analysis can guide decisions on whether to hold, buy, or sell shares. Microsoft has a strong track record of earnings beats, but the decision to buy before or after earnings hinges on your risk tolerance. With robust growth in key areas and a bullish analyst outlook, investors need to carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach. Revenue growth, operating margins and customer growth in cloud and AI businesses. Microsoft’s next earnings report is expected on October 30, 2024, post-market hours. You can listen to the earnings call on Microsoft’s investor relations website. A miss in earnings could result in short-term volatility, with the stock price potentially dropping.

Title: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Most Promising Future Stock According to Analysts
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-most-promising-075118524.html

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Microsoft Headquarters Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 21.71%% Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25% market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multi-billion gaming industry with Activation’s Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well-positioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60%. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AI’s customer base increased by almost 60% during that time. The vast majority of Microsoft’s planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent $55.7 billion, of which $19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the company’s earnings will increase by 13% per year.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.
