Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $500?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been one of the top performers this year, with its stock climbing 20%. This is well ahead of the broader market, where the S&P 500 has risen 10%, while peers like Amazon are up only 4%, and Google has gained less than 10%. This strong performance is primarily driven by rapid cloud growth and sustained momentum in AI adoption. Microsoft's leadership in the expanding AI sector has clearly boosted investor confidence. At a current price of more than $500, is MSFT stock still attractive? We believe it is. Our evaluation of Microsoft across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows a company with excellent operating results and a strong financial position, as outlined below. That being said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since launch. Also, see – Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100? On a sales or profit basis, MSFT stock appears very expensive relative to the broader market. Microsoft’s revenues have expanded meaningfully over the past few years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly stronger than most peers in the Trefis universe. Microsoft’s balance sheet appears extremely strong. MSFT stock has fared slightly better than the S&P 500 during certain downturns. Concerned about downturn risks? Our dashboard Will You Be Comfortable Buying Microsoft Stock? offers a detailed view of how MSFT performed during past market crashes. In summary, Microsoft’s performance across the parameters is: • Growth: Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Strong Microsoft has delivered across all dimensions, justifying its premium valuation. At around $500 per share, the stock trades at 37x trailing earnings, slightly above its four-year average P/E of 35. We believe this premium is warranted, with more upside possible. This view is supported by strong Azure sales and rising profitability, as its operating margin increased from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now. Of course, we could be wrong in our assessment, and investors may hesitate to pay a higher premium. But if you believe in AI-driven growth and have a 3–5 year horizon, Microsoft remains a compelling stock. Remember, individual stock investing carries risks. Trefis’ High Quality (HQ) Portfolio—a basket of 30 stocks—has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years, delivering better returns with lower risk.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Was Dubbed 'Godfather of AI.' The Company Is Betting On These AI Stocks

Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaking giant at the center of the artificial intelligence revolution, has delivered huge returns for investors since its meteoric rise in 2023 and 2024. But the world's most valuable company, led by the so-called "Godfather of AI," CEO Jensen Huang, has investments of its own. The company is required to disclose its portoflio information every quarter using the SEC Form 13-F. This filing offers only a snapshot of Nvidia's portfolio at the end of the quarter. It does not provide any details about gains or losses made from any sales made during the quarter. Here's what Nvidia's AI best looked like at the end of June— By far Nvidia's most valuable holding is CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV), an AI cloud computing provider that went public in March. At the end of June, Nvidia held 24.3 million shares, that amounts to roughly 7% stake in the company, worth a little over $3.9 billion. As of Aug. 26, that stake is valued is close to $2.2 billion, after Coreweave saw almost a third of its share value disappear following disappointing quarterly earnings results. However, shares of CoreWeave have more than doubled from their IPO price of $40 in March to more than $90 in late August. Arm Holdings plc (ARM) is a U.K.-based developer of CPU chip designs whose clients include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google. Nvidia reported a stake of 1.1 million Arm shares worth $178 million in June (about $154 million as of Aug. 26). Applied Digital Corp. (APLD) provides data center space to companies seeking AI compute infrastructure. Its shares have more than doubled this year, including a huge gain after the company agreed to lease data center operations to fellow Nvidia partner CoreWeave. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital. That position, which was worth about $77 million at the end of June, has grown to over $125 million as of Aug. 26. Nebius Group NV (NBIS) is an Amsterdam-based provider of AI infrastructure. Nvidia first disclosed its 1.2 million-share stake in the company in February, and its stock has jumped more than two-thirds since. That means Nvidia's investment has only grown, from nearly $65 million in June to about $85 million at the end of August. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX), a biotech firm focused on AI-powered drug discovery. It's also another Nvidia investment that has seen its stock fall this year, dropping 27%. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Recursion as of June 30. Chinese autonomous vehicle manufacturer WeRide Inc. (WRD) operates a fleet spanning 30 cities across nine countries. Its shares spiked after Nvidia revealed a 1.7-million share stake in February, but they've lost about a third of their value in 2025. Nvidia's portfolio has largely been successful this year, with stocks like CoreWeave actually outperforming the chipmaker itself so far in 2025. Nvidia stock has been no slouch, though, gaining 33% this year and hitting a record high of $182.70 earlier this month. The company is due to report quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, and AI investors will be watching for clues from Huang about the state of the sector.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T16:57:44Z

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Title: Spring AI MCP Servers OAuth2 Example

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely access external data and tools. Let us delve into understanding how to secure Spring AI MCP Servers with OAuth2. Spring AI is an extension of the popular Spring Boot framework that allows developers to integrate large language models (LLMs) and AI capabilities directly into their applications. It simplifies building intelligent features such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and natural language understanding within Spring-based systems. OAuth2 is an open-standard authorization framework that allows applications to securely access resources on behalf of a user. In the context of Spring AI MCP servers, OAuth2 ensures that only authorized clients can interact with AI services, protecting sensitive data and AI endpoints. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications connect LLMs to data and tools, like how USB-C connects devices to peripherals. It enables building agents and complex workflows by linking models with the world. Learn more about MCP here. Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring applications. In the context of MCP servers, it ensures that only authorized clients can access AI model endpoints, protecting sensitive data and services. Key features of Spring Security for MCP servers: Using Spring Security, developers can: Overall, Spring Security provides the backbone for safely exposing AI model endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized clients can interact with the MCP server. Add these dependencies to your pom.xml: Define a controller that provides realistic stock data in MCP format. In production, you could fetch real stock data from APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. This Spring Boot controller, annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping("/stocks"), provides a simple API to fetch stock information. It stores stock symbols and their prices in an immutable Map called stockPrices. The @GetMapping("/{symbol}") method takes a stock symbol as a path variable, looks up the price, and if not found, throws a ResponseStatusException with a 404 status. If the stock exists, it creates a Map containing the symbol, price, currency (“USD”), company name (determined by the private getCompanyName method using a switch expression), and the current timestamp. The resulting map is returned as JSON when the API endpoint is called. Enable OAuth2 security for your MCP server: This Spring configuration class, annotated with @Configuration, sets up security for the application using Spring Security. It defines a SecurityFilterChain bean that customizes HTTP security. CSRF protection is disabled with csrf().disable() and CORS support is enabled using cors(). The configuration requires that any request to endpoints under /stocks/** must be authenticated. Finally, it configures the application as an OAuth2 resource server using JWT tokens (oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()), ensuring that only requests with valid JWTs can access the secured stock endpoints. To enable your MCP server to authenticate and authorize clients using OAuth2, you need to configure a client in application.properties. This configuration registers a client with the authorization server, specifying the client ID, secret, authentication method, and allowed grant types. With this configuration, your MCP server can request JWT tokens from the authorization server and include them in requests to secured endpoints. This setup ensures that only authorized clients can access your stock data API. For this tutorial, we will use Keycloak as the authorization server to register the client. The focus is on the MCP server, so Keycloak setup is not covered here. Note: Before configuring the OAuth2 client, you need to register your MCP server as a client in Keycloak. Create a new client, set the client ID (e.g., stocks-client), configure the client secret, and enable the client_credentials grant type. This allows your MCP server to obtain access tokens to secure its endpoints. After adding the dependencies, creating the controller, and configuring security, you can run your MCP server as a standard Spring Boot application. Use your IDE or execute mvn spring-boot:run from the command line in the project directory. Once the application starts, it will listen on the default port 8080. Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant: Use the token to query stock information. Please note localhost:8080 will act as the mcp.example.com. The server will return a JSON response like: Unauthorized requests will be rejected with a 401 error. This setup ensures that only authenticated clients can access stock data, making the MCP server production-ready and secure. We created a Stocks Info MCP Server with Spring AI and secured it using OAuth2. The server returns stock data only to authorized clients, ensuring secure access while keeping the setup simple and easy to use. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle
