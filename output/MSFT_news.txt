The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often referred to as “the Dow,” is one of the most widely recognized stock market indices in the world. It serves as a barometer for the overall health of the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the broader economy. This article provides a detailed overview of the DJIA, its history, composition, calculation, significance, and its role in global finance. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a thorough understanding of why the DJIA is a cornerstone of financial markets. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly-owned companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are considered blue-chip stocks, representing a significant portion of the U.S. economy. The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture between S&P Global, CME Group, and News Corp. Unlike other indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite, which are weighted by market capitalization, the DJIA is weighted by the price of its constituent stocks. This means that higher-priced stocks have a greater influence on the index’s movements. The DJIA was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, and his business partner, Edward Jones. Initially, the index included just 12 companies, primarily from industrial sectors such as railroads, cotton, gas, and sugar. The goal was to provide a simple way to gauge the performance of the U.S. stock market. Over time, the index evolved to reflect changes in the economy. By 1928, the DJIA expanded to include 30 companies, a number that remains unchanged today. The composition of the index has also shifted to include companies from a broader range of industries, such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods. The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index’s value. The formula for calculating the DJIA is: DJIA=∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)DivisorDJIA=Divisor∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)​ The divisor is a number that adjusts for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions to ensure the index remains consistent over time. The divisor is periodically updated to maintain the index’s continuity. For example, if the combined price of the 30 stocks is $5,000 and the divisor is 0.15, the DJIA would be calculated as: DJIA=50000.15=33,333.33DJIA=0.155000​=33,333.33 The DJIA includes 30 companies that are leaders in their industries. These companies are selected by the Averages Committee, which considers factors such as market capitalization, reputation, and sector representation. Some of the well-known companies in the DJIA include: The index is periodically updated to reflect changes in the economy. For example, in 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the index, replacing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies. The DJIA is often used as a proxy for the overall health of the U.S. economy. When the index rises, it is generally interpreted as a sign of economic growth and investor confidence. Conversely, a declining DJIA may indicate economic uncertainty or recession. The DJIA is closely watched by investors, analysts, and policymakers. Movements in the index can influence investor sentiment and drive market trends. As one of the oldest stock market indices, the DJIA provides a historical benchmark for comparing current market performance to past trends. While the DJIA focuses on U.S. companies, its performance has a global impact. Many international investors use the index as a gauge for U.S. market conditions. The S&P 500 includes 500 companies and is weighted by market capitalization, making it a more comprehensive representation of the U.S. stock market. The Nasdaq Composite focuses on technology and growth-oriented companies, with over 3,000 constituents. It is also market-cap weighted. The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies, providing insight into the performance of smaller businesses. Investors can gain exposure to the DJIA through: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remains one of the most influential and widely followed stock market indices in the world. Despite its limitations, it provides valuable insights into the performance of the U.S. economy and serves as a key benchmark for investors. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a beginner, understanding the DJIA is essential for navigating the complexities of the financial markets.

Title: Palantir stock has been on a tear. But a reckoning could come soon

Palantir Technologies (PLTR+1.24%) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company’s bright earnings prospects won’t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it’s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That’s taken Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. “The stock’s not made of teflon,” said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an “extraordinary” level that can’t last forever. “Eventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,” Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir’s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts’ estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company’s earnings prospects. He said analysts’ estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang’s optimism about Palantir’s potential work for the Trump administration — and his caution about the stock’s immediate prospects. “Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,” Rechenthin said. He said he won’t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT-0.82%) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use. —Britney Nguyen and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.
