The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion — but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.
