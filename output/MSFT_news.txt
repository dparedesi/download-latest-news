We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end.

Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and forum social network. The company has been enhancing its AI capabilities by acquiring Memorable AI, following a partnership announcement with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT). These moves reflect its commitment to integrating advanced AI technologies into its offerings. On October 9, 2024, Jefferies analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a “Buy” rating and a price target of $90. According to the firm, this valuation is based on $65 per share for Advertising and $25 per share for Data Licensing. “RDDT is combining AI-driven product enhancements with a robust archive of contextual content to spur trial and engagement, resulting in recent user growth accelerating to the highest level in 2+ years,” -Analysts said in a note. The company’s growth can be attributed to its deeper integration with Google search and the launch of a faster Web platform. Investments in AI and machine learning have enhanced recommendation algorithms, further improving user experience and increasing logged-in users. Jefferies also notes how RDDT’s extensive database of user-generated content has garnered the interest of third-party developers of generative AI models, securing approximately $325 million in non-exclusive contract licensing revenue over the next three years. “We believe expanding use-cases for Gen AI over time will attract new partnerships, resulting in additional high margin revenue streams and upside to consensus”. -Jefferies analysts Overall RDDT ranks 17th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of RDDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Microsoft Stock Earnings: Is It A Buy Before Or After Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/microsoft-msft-stock-earnings-is-it-buy-before-after-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T20:20:23Z
Full Content:
Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report its earnings soon, and investors are keen to see if the tech giant will continue its trend of strong financial performance. With consistent earnings beats in recent quarters and steady stock price growth, it’s worth asking if now is the right time to buy before or after the company’s earnings report. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s historical earnings, recent performance and factors to consider ahead of its report. Over the past eight quarters, Microsoft has demonstrated impressive earnings performance, beating estimates every time for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, except for a single revenue miss. The company has consistently surprised to the upside, with significant EPS beats like 12.9% in first-quarter 2024 and a notable revenue beat of nearly $2 billion during the same period. The strength in Microsoft’s earnings history highlights a pattern of outperforming market expectations, building investor confidence in its financial reliability. These consistent surprises, including a 5.8% EPS beat in fiscal second-quarter 2024, suggest that Microsoft’s earnings reports tend to favorably surprise analysts, which could be a signal for bullish investors looking for an edge. Microsoft’s stock performance has been solid despite market volatility. In the past month, MSFT stock has seen a slight dip of 4.4%, but year to date, it remains up by 12.2%. Over the past year, the stock has gained 25.3%, reflecting its resilience and growth. Microsoft’s five-year performance is remarkable, boasting a 202.8% increase. If Microsoft continues its growth trajectory, discussions around whether Microsoft stock can reach $1,000 could gain traction. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus recommendation to buy and a price target range from $420 to $600, well above the current share price of $418.74. This aligns with Microsoft’s strong business fundamentals, including a gross margin of 69.8% and an impressive operating margin of 44.6%. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Before diving into the specifics of the earnings, it's crucial to consider various factors that could impact Microsoft's performance. Economic conditions, competitive pressures and evolving market dynamics all play a significant role in shaping results. Investors should also keep an eye on the overall tech sector's health, particularly in relation to AI and cloud computing, where Microsoft has established a strong foothold. Microsoft is expected to continue its strong financial performance. The consensus EPS forecast for the next quarter is 13.15, with estimates ranging between 12.74 and 13.86. On the revenue side, analysts expect $279.21 billion, reflecting Microsoft’s robust revenue growth of 15.7% year over year. These high expectations from analysts show optimism but also set the bar high for the upcoming report. The broader market conditions play a crucial role in Microsoft’s stock performance, especially with the tech sector facing some headwinds recently. Investors should consider the macroeconomic factors impacting tech stocks, including interest rates and inflation, which could introduce volatility around the earnings report. Microsoft’s focus on AI, cloud computing and its growth in enterprise software positions it well for future growth. Recent news includes its strategic partnerships and investments in AI, which could boost future revenue. Microsoft's 0.8% dividend yield and consistent payout add value for long-term investors. Microsoft’s focus on AI also aligns it with other top AI stocks that are poised for growth. Just as Nvidia stock has benefitted from advancements in AI, Microsoft is also expected to capitalize on similar trends. As the scheduled earnings date of October 30 approaches, several key metrics will be vital in evaluating Microsoft's performance. These include trends in semiconductor shortages that could affect production, memory chip pricing and any supply chain disruptions that may have occurred. Given the increasing reliance on technology across sectors, understanding these elements will provide deeper insights into Microsoft's revenue and profitability. Revenue growth remains a key metric for Microsoft. In the previous quarter, Microsoft’s revenue grew by 3.6%, with actual revenue coming in at $56.5 billion, beating estimates by nearly $2 billion. For the upcoming earnings, investors will focus on whether Microsoft can sustain or exceed its growth trajectory, particularly given its expansion into AI and cloud computing. With an operating margin of 44.6% and a gross margin of 69.8%, Microsoft’s profitability is another critical aspect of the earnings report. Investors will watch for any changes in operating income, especially given its strong Ebitda growth of 26.7% year over year, as it reflects the company’s operational efficiency.

The strength of Microsoft’s customer base in key areas like Azure and enterprise software will be pivotal. The company has managed to grow its earnings per share by 21.9% year over year, which ties directly to its expanding customer base. A continuation of this trend would be a positive signal for long-term growth. Guidance is an essential part of the earnings report, offering insights into the company’s outlook. Microsoft typically provides projections that help investors assess the company’s growth trajectory. Analyzing this guidance helps investors understand the management's expectations and can significantly influence MSFT stock movement. If guidance exceeds market expectations, it could indicate robust future performance, whereas conservative projections may raise concerns. Deciding when to invest in Microsoft stock surrounding earnings reports is a critical consideration for investors. Buying before earnings can lead to significant gains if the report exceeds expectations. However, this strategy also comes with risks, including increased volatility. Conversely, purchasing after earnings allows for a more informed decision based on actual performance, yet it may result in missing out on potential price jumps. Buying before earnings can offer opportunities for early positioning and potential gains if the results are positive. However, this approach carries the risk of heightened volatility, as stocks can react sharply to earnings surprises. Additionally, investors may find themselves acting on limited information, which can lead to poor decision-making if expectations are not met. Pros Cons Purchasing after earnings presents its advantages, as it allows investors to make decisions based on actual performance rather than speculation. This can reduce the risk of significant losses if the stock reacts poorly to the earnings report. However, waiting until after the earnings release could mean missing out on a rally if the stock jumps in response to strong results. Furthermore, the market may overreact, leading to corrections or rebounds that savvy investors might miss. Pros Cons Investor sentiment plays a major role in stock price movement around earnings reports. Microsoft’s history of beating earnings estimates often fuels bullish sentiment, but the broader market sentiment, particularly in the tech sector, can introduce volatility. A positive outlook from the market can bolster MSFT stock prices, while negative sentiment may result in a downturn. Analysts often emphasize the need to understand how investor psychology interacts with earnings results, as this can lead to exaggerated reactions, impacting the stock's short-term performance. Understanding the pulse of market reactions before and after the report is crucial for timing your investment. Experts consistently view Microsoft as a solid investment, particularly with its expansion into AI and cloud computing. As the earnings report approaches, expert opinions become invaluable. Analysts provide context and insights that can shape investor expectations. By examining expert assessments, investors can gain a clearer picture of how Microsoft's performance aligns with broader market trends. This analysis can guide decisions on whether to hold, buy, or sell shares. Microsoft has a strong track record of earnings beats, but the decision to buy before or after earnings hinges on your risk tolerance. With robust growth in key areas and a bullish analyst outlook, investors need to carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach. Revenue growth, operating margins and customer growth in cloud and AI businesses. Microsoft’s next earnings report is expected on October 30, 2024, post-market hours. You can listen to the earnings call on Microsoft’s investor relations website. A miss in earnings could result in short-term volatility, with the stock price potentially dropping.

Title: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Most Promising Future Stock According to Analysts

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Microsoft Headquarters Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 21.71%% Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25% market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multi-billion gaming industry with Activation’s Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well-positioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60%. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AI’s customer base increased by almost 60% during that time. The vast majority of Microsoft’s planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent $55.7 billion, of which $19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the company’s earnings will increase by 13% per year. Even though Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, It is one of the most promising stocks given its record in returning shareholder value. The company already pays a 0.80% dividend yield. Additionally, the stock is rated as a strong buy based on 30 Wall Street analysts with an average price target of $504.73, implying a 21.71% change from the last price of $414.71. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What Are The Magnificent Seven Stocks?

Time Published: 2024-10-16T19:37:25Z

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years.

Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services.

The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence.

Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market.

While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms.

The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) fell 9.7% in the afternoon session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected. Management noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025. Lastly, CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region. ASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's (ASML) critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Lam Research? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Lam Research’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 19 days ago when the stock gained 7.5% as semiconductor stocks, especially the memory chip manufacturers, surged after Micron reported impressive fourth-quarter earnings results. Micron beat across most of the key metrics we track, including revenue, operating profit, and EPS. Notably, the company recorded a whopping 93% revenue growth compared to the previous year, showing that the AI party is still ongoing. Micron attributed the outperformance to the growing demand for memory chips that power generative AI applications. Looking ahead, Micron provided strong sales and profitability guidance for the next quarter, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Overall, the result highlights the abundant growth opportunities for chip makers with technologies to accelerate the booming AI trend. Lam Research is up 3.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $77.41 per share, it is still trading 31.3% below its 52-week high of $112.73 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lam Research’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,198. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. Sign in to access your portfolio
