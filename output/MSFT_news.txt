Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates. Fed Rate Cuts Expected Stocks finally saw a down week after the S&P 500 hit all-time highs the previous week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), continued to move higher. The returns on the Magnificent 7 and bank stocks have been stellar since the U.S. Presidential election. Tesla (TSLA) has stood out since the election, rising almost 74%! Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again. Stocks are in the midst of the most favorable time of the year, so the seasonals add some comfort that last week’s decline shouldn’t prove to be the start of a significant decline. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, companies are issuing debt to buy bitcoin. Early adopters of the strategy include Marathon Holdings and Core Scientific—both crypto firms—and Japan's Metaplanet. Meanwhile, more company boards are assenting to straightforward bitcoin purchases. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, it remains rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. And yet, a recent $1 million purchase by biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals signals a shifting tide. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told Business Insider. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

Title: Virtualizing GCP data by using Fabric Shortcuts: Data Engineering with Fabric

Time Published: 2024-12-11T00:00:11Z

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.
