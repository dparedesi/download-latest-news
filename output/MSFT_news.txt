ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: This 7.2% Payer Is The Cheapest Fund You Don’t Already Own

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Large cap stocks have been crushing small caps in the last few years. That’s, well, unusual, to say the least. And it’s set us up for cheap 7.2% dividends (with upside) from closed end funds. Small caps, of course, aren’t known for big dividends. The benchmark ETF for them, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) only pays 1.1%. But stick with me for a moment and I’ll show you how we’re going to pull this off. Around the time of the pandemic, small caps started lagging the S&P 500 after years of tracking it. Since then, the gap has widened. But there are signs a shift is in the works. “Investors Look to S&P’s Forgotten 493 Stocks as Megacap Tech Wobbles” reads a recent headline from the Financial Times. While perhaps a bit premature, the article does signal a new pivot. Simply put, Big Tech, which dominates large caps and includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT), has been soaring for a couple of years, drawing attention away from the rest of the market. If we look at the concentration of the S&P 500—that is, the percentage of the index comprised of the 10 largest firms—we see a stunning trend. Going by this chart, the 10 biggest S&P 500 firms make up a quarter of the index’s earnings and 40% of its market cap. In other words, Big Tech has been getting pricier and pricier in relation to the rest of the market since 2022. That’s obviously unsustainable in the long run, and it could prompt investors to look for alternatives to the Apples and Alphabets of the world. As they do, small caps are likely to garner more attention, closing the gap with large caps. That would mean years of outperformance for these companies. This Small Cap ETF Is Okay … If this happens, expect IWM to start beating S&P 500 index funds. That outperformance could then reinforce itself as more investors buy, rewarding those who got in early. There’s just one problem with IWM: that 1.1% yield. Lucky for us, there is a small-cap focused closed-end fund (CEF) paying a lot more. It’s been quietly crushing IWM, too. That would be the Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT), which focuses on smaller companies with promising cash flow growth. In purple above, we see RVT’s total net asset value (NAV) return, which shows the performance of its underlying portfolio so far this year, including dividends. While many investors haven’t heard of RVT holdings such as IES Holdings (IESC), Assured Guaranty (AGO) or SEI Investments (SEIC), these stocks have helped the fund not just profit but outperform. With a near-10% NAV return, RVT is far ahead of the small-cap index’s 6.6%. That means RVT is generating “alpha”: earning more than the index it tracks. At the same time, the CEF’s total market price return is up 5.8%, so investors aren’t bidding up the shares as much as its fundamentals warrant. The result is this chart: RVT’s discount to NAV, which measures the difference between NAV and the fund’s price on the open market, has been widening in 2025 and recently hit double digits for the first time in a year. That’s simply too big of a markdown. This kind of thing happens with CEFs all the time. Often what follows is that investors rush in to fix the mispricing, resulting in capital gains on top of the fund’s income stream. Speaking of income, while IWM yields 1.1%, RVT pays that 7.2% I mentioned earlier. That’s because, like most CEFs, RVT pays out as much of its profits as possible as dividends. This makes the fund and attractive way to invest in small caps, a notoriously volatile asset class. Getting part of our profits as dividends reduces our exposure to that volatility and gives us an income stream we can use however we like. We could even pair RVT with a CEF holding different assets, using the income from one fund to buy the other when it’s oversold, and doing the reverse when it’s overbought. This is the kind of strategy we use in our CEF Insider service, as it helps us secure a large income stream and position ourselves for gains without being overexposed to one part of the market.
