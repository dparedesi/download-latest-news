Title: Why Constellation Energy, NuScale Power, Nano Nuclear, and Oklo Stocks All Popped Today
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/constellation-nuscale-nano-nuclear-stocks-popped/
Time Published: 20240920T161141
Summary: A famous nuclear power plant is coming back online.
Content: Nuclear power stocks are glowing green on Friday, and they have Constellation Energy (CEG 22.29%) to thank for it. This morning, the electric utility giant announced it will restart Unit 1 at the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide electricity to power Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%) data centers.
Nuclear power stocks are surging in response to the news. As of 10 a.m. ET, Constellation stock itself is up a strong 14.4%, while nuclear upstarts NuScale Power Corporation (SMR 11.34%) and Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE 22.95%) have gained 13% and 15%, respectively, and tiny Oklo (OKLO 27.23%) is leading the pack higher with a 16% gain.

Three Mile Island is in the news again
Let's start with some background for those who don't remember when Three Mile Island scared the pants off everyone living on the East Coast. In the middle of the night on March 28, 1979, Three Mile Island's Unit 2 reactor (near Middletown, Pennsylvania) suffered a partial meltdown in what the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) calls "the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history." 
The release of radioactivity from the plant was minimal and caused "no detectable health effects on plant workers," much less nearby residents, according to the commission. Yet the terror inspired by the word "meltdown" alone sufficed to spark a movement, still ongoing, to tighten regulations on nuclear power plant construction. Thanks largely to these stricter regulations, operating a nuclear power plant is today one of the most expensive ways to produce electricity in the U.S. -- despite nuclear fuel being one of the cheapest fuels available. 
And yet America still needs power -- not least to run the giant server farms that power the kinds of artificial intelligence projects and cloud computing services that Microsoft wants to provide.





Why Constellation is reopening Three Mile Island
Hence today's news. Having just signed "its largest-ever power purchase agreemen

Title: Why Cameco Stock Popped 8% on Friday

Time Published: 20240920T153724
Summary: Interest in uranium stocks is blowing up.
Content: Uranium stocks are glowing green on Friday, and they have Constellation Energy to thank for it. This morning, the electric utility giant announced plans to restart Unit 1 at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant by 2028, in order to supply power to Microsoft data centers.
In no time flat, shares of uranium mining stocks such as Energy Fuels, Uranium Energy, and Denison Mines began powering up. None went so far as Cameco Corporation (CCJ 8.08%), however, which as of 11:10 a.m. ET is gaining 8%.

Why Cameco stock is glowing green today
It's no great mystery why. A big electric utility is restarting a nuclear plant, and that plant will need uranium to generate power. Uranium miners provide that uranium -- and so their stocks rise.
But this story is even bigger than Three Mile Island, because where Constellation leads, other power plant operators may follow. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there are currently 54 nuclear power plants operating in the U.S., running 94 reactors. Additionally, EIA says 22 reactors are "in various stages of decommissioning," and could theoretically be reactivated. 
Although only one new reactor is under construction in the U.S., multiple small nuclear power start-ups, with names like NuScale Power Corporation and Nano Nuclear Energy, are working to get approval for new, smaller-scale nuclear power plant designs.





Is Cameco stock a buy?
All of which is to say, there's potential for quite a bit of growth in nuclear power in the United States, and for growth in demand for uranium fuel. As the only U.S.-listed uranium miner that's currently both profitable and free-cash-flow-positive (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), Cameco stock is a logical beneficiary of this trend -- if it does turn into a trend.
That doesn't make Cameco stock a buy necessarily, however. Valued at 46 times free cash flow and 94 times trailing earnings, and paying only a 0.2% dividend, Cameco may be the best bargain in u

Title: 1 Favorable Trend That Explains the 99% Increase in Taiwan Semiconductor's Stock Price
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/20/1-favorable-trend-that-explains-the-99-increase-in/
Time Published: 20240920T150800
Summary: Spending for all things AI is ramping up.
Content: Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.21%) have soared over the last year, largely due to the soaring demand for cutting-edge chips capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and a rebound in the broader semiconductor sector.
TSMC, as the company is also known, is the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, serving companies like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD. It controls more than half of the third-party foundry market and is responsible for an estimated 90% of the advanced chips churned out by third-party manufacturers.
That makes TSMC one of the most important companies in the world, as semiconductors are essential components in most modern technology.
Its revenue growth has been accelerating and it has been generating strong margins. The chart below helps show why the stock has jumped by 99% over the last 12 months.
Cloud infrastructure spending is soaring
Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world, and all three have ramped up their capital expenditures over the last four quarters as the AI boom has gathered momentum.






GOOGL Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
Combined, those three companies have added about $17 billion in capital expenditures to build new data centers and meet demand for the processing power to underpin new generative AI technologies. While some investors have criticized Microsoft and Alphabet, suggesting that they have been overspending on AI infrastructure, those companies have defended those investments, insisting that the risks of underspending and losing the AI race are greater than the risks of overspending.
A significant slice of that added spending is going toward chips that come out of TSMC's facilities, as the foundry giant manufactures plenty of high-end chips on behalf of Nvidia and others. As long as those companies are ramping up their capital expenditures, investors can expect TSMC stock to keep outperforming.

Time Published: 20240920T130000
Summary: Both big tech players are benefiting from AI's rise.
Content: The artificial intelligence (AI) race is still in its early stages, though it might not feel like it, and there's still plenty of time for tech companies to overtake each other. For investors looking for opportunities in the space, it may be appealing to pick a small AI start-up that might grow by leaps and bounds, but larger companies have deeper pockets, making their AI investments (and shifting strategies) much more likely to succeed.
Which ones will prove to be the best AI stocks in the coming years? Let's take a look at what Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%) and Alphabet (GOOG 0.86%) (GOOGL 0.89%) are doing to shore up their AI dominance, and consider which one is more likely to be the better artificial intelligence stock in the coming years.
Why Microsoft is a leading AI play
Let's start with the most obviously smart AI move Microsoft has made: It invested an estimated $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That gave Microsoft early access to some of the most advanced AI models available, and it wisely started embedding them into nearly all of its software products.

ChatGPT is the underlying AI tech in Microsoft's Copilot tools, which are now in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The software bundle they comprise, Microsoft 365, is used by 1.3 million companies in the U.S. alone. For tens of millions of workers, Microsoft's software is now synonymous with the advanced AI tools they use every day.
This integration is already paying off for Microsoft, and the best example may come from the company's GitHub developer platform, in which 40% of its recent revenue growth came from Copilot, according to management. Microsoft's leadership said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that AI is driving GitHub's growth and has boosted its annual revenue run rate to $2 billion.





Of course, Microsoft isn't just a software company these days. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world, with 25% of the market. Microsoft has in

Time Published: 20240920T100500
Summary: These ETFs could all benefit as money supply growth accelerates over the next year.
Content: If there's one thing that's characterized the current bull market, it's the rise of big tech stocks leading the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation. Capital has piled into the biggest names in the market, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. All five have played significant roles in the advancement of AI, and together, they account for 63% of the S&P 500's returns through the first half of 2024.
As a result of the meteoric rise of the world's biggest companies, market concentration is near levels investors haven't seen since the 1970s. While those big AI tech companies have produced solid earnings results, propelling their stocks higher, market concentration has historically always reversed course. One market indicator suggests the market may be about to broaden out.

U.S. money supply is finally growing again
Decelerating growth in money supply is typically tied to an increase in market concentration among a few large stocks, according to Khuram Chaudhry, head of European Quantitative Strategy at J.P. Morgan.
Think about it from the perspective of a business owner: If the money supply is tight, there's less access to cash to grow your business. If you're a very large business already, though, you can produce enough cash from operations that you don't need to worry about outside funding. Investors understand this dynamic, and the big get bigger. That trend is exacerbated by the high capital requirements of building an AI business, which is what's currently driving the bull market.
The money supply grew quickly in 2020 as the government injected cash into the economy with stimulus checks, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 0%. Starting in 2021, we saw the after-effects of those policies start to take hold. We naturally saw slower growth, as measured by the U.S. M2 money supply.

Summary: Brookfield Renewable could generate a supercharged total return in the coming years.
Content: Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 0.70%) (BEP 0.84%) has a stellar record of paying dividends. The leading global renewable energy producer has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate over the last two decades. It has raised its payment by at least 5% for 13 years in a row. 
The company is just getting started. It has several catalysts that should combine to deliver 10%-plus annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share through at least 2028. That will easily give it the power to support its plan of raising the dividend by 5% to 9% annually. With Brookfield Renewable already offering a high-yielding payout (more than 4.5%), it should have the fuel to generate supercharged total returns in the coming years. 

Built on a rock-solid foundation
Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy platforms. It owns hydro, wind, utility-scale solar, distributed energy, and storage assets across all major markets that have the capacity to produce 34 gigawatts (GW) of power. In addition, it has a growing portfolio of sustainable solutions, like biofuel production, recycling, carbon capture and storage, and nuclear services. These assets generate predictable, stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts with utilities and large corporations.
Most of its contracts index prices to inflation (70% of Brookfield's revenue). Because of that, they should supply the company with stable and steadily rising cash flow. Brookfield expects its FFO per share to increase by 2% to 3% per year due to inflation escalation alone. 
The company paid out less than 75% of its stable cash flow in dividends during the first half of this year. That gave it a solid cushion and allowed it to retain cash to help fund its continued expansion. 





Brookfield also has a very strong balance sheet. It has investment-grade credit and primarily uses long-term, fixed-rate debt to fund its business. The company also has lots of liquidity, which it routinely r

Title: Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar in the Remainder of 2024

Summary: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently squashed concerns about the company's latest artificial intelligence chips.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024, but it has been in a slump since mid-July as investors digested some potential headwinds.
There was a rumored delay with the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center, which are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue. Analysts have also questioned how long Nvidia's top customers will continue spending billions of dollars on their AI aspirations.
However, those concerns might have been put to rest over the last few weeks. Here's why Nvidia stock could soar to new highs before the end of 2024.

All eyes are on the new Blackwell GPUs
Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processor (GPU) for the data center set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can handle multiple tasks at once while maintaining a high throughput. They also have built-in memory so they are ideal for processing large volumes of data, which is critical when training AI models and performing AI inference.
According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years. That presents a substantial opportunity, which is why the company continues to design new chips with more processing power and better energy efficiency to stay ahead of the competition.





Nvidia is now shipping its new H200 GPU, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100, while consuming half the amount of electricity. But the company recently unveiled an entirely new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which promises an even greater leap in performance.
The new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference at a staggering 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GB200 GPU will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which is similar to what many customers originally paid for the H100, so it's going to drive an incredib

Time Published: 20240920T073500
Summary: Numerous growth drivers and strong tailwinds should combine to drive this artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer higher.
Content: There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a lot of buzz since early last year. Recent technological advances have taken these algorithms to the next level, enabling them to generate original content of all stripes, improve productivity, and streamline processes.
Companies on the leading edge of this trend have profited from these advances in technology. In fact, six of the world's seven most valuable companies, when measured by market cap, have embraced the paradigm shift of generative AI and staked their claims to profits from these next-generation systems. Topping the charts are Apple and Microsoft, the only two companies that currently boast a market cap of more than $3 trillion.
However, one company that appears ordained to make a name for itself as a founding member of the $10 trillion club is Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%). The pioneer in graphics processing units (GPUs) is nipping at the heels of the current leaders with a market cap of $2.8 trillion but seems destined to break new ground.
Let's look at the numerous growth drivers that could send Nvidia stock to new heights.

Shall we play a game?
Nvidia revolutionized gaming a quarter of a century ago when the company pioneered the GPU, which produced lifelike images in video games. The secret to its success is parallel processing, or the ability of these advanced chips to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It wasn't long before Nvidia realized the vast potential of this discovery and pivoted to tailor this technology to a host of other applications.





The company has since adapted GPUs to power cloud computing, data centers, machine learning, autonomous driving, generative AI, and more.
The tale of the tape
Over the past 10 years, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 2,350% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,490%. While it hasn't all been in a straight line, the company's consistently strong performance has driven imp

Title: Forget Nvidia: Buy This Magnificent Tech Stock Instead

Time Published: 20240920T071000
Summary: This tech player is on track to prosper in the artificial intelligence market.
Content: Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) has been the stock everyone is talking about for quite some time -- and for good reason. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip niche with a market share of about 80%, and this has translated into record earnings. Even better, Nvidia's focus on innovation means its dominance is likely to last.
That said, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap, and it has lost some ground recently. It's down by about 7% over the past month, and is off by about 15% from the all-time high it touched this summer. I think that loss of momentum is temporary, though, and believe this top tech company still represents a fantastic long-term investment.
But right now, there exists a stock that has recently picked up momentum, is at an earlier stage in its latest growth story, and is inexpensive. This player, too, represents a great long-term investment. That's why, today, I would forget Nvidia and buy this magnificent tech stock instead.

A focus on cloud infrastructure
So which company am I talking about? One that was long known for its database software, but now is on its way to becoming a key player in the world of AI: Oracle (ORCL 0.24%). The tech company put a focus on cloud infrastructure and services as the AI boom accelerated, and this has turned out to be a smart strategy.
Today, the cloud services segment is the company's biggest business, and its operating income and earnings per share have taken off. Other financial metrics are showing amazing growth too. Cloud infrastructure revenue, for example, soared 45% year over year to $2.2 billion in its recently completed fiscal 2024 first quarter. Importantly, its remaining performance obligations surged 53% to $99 billion. This metric of yet-to-be-billed revenue offers visibility into its future growth.





I also like the fact that Oracle's return on invested capital, which dropped in recent years, is starting to head higher again -- showing that the company is progressively b
