We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. IonQ (IONQ) stock has slumped along with other names in the quantum computing sector following comments made by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in early January. However, despite the free-falling share price and cheapening valuation, I’m bearish. This stock rose on the expectation that a quantum revolution was potentially just around the corner, but the reality is that investors will need to be very patient. The stock still looks overvalued, and it’s operating in a crowded space, so not every company will make it. As such, I don’t think it’s time to buy IonQ stock. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener IonQ is a pioneering quantum computing company that utilizes trapped-ion technology to develop quantum computers. Unlike traditional approaches, IonQ’s method employs lasers to manipulate individual atoms as qubits, potentially enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors. It’s all incredibly interesting, and judging by the company’s robust set of announcements towards the end of 2024, this approach has positioned IonQ as a leader in the quantum computing industry — at least among small caps. However, recent comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have sent quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, into a tailspin. During Nvidia’s CES 2025 event, Huang suggested that practical quantum computers might be 15 to 30 years away from realization. It’s a disappointing timeline, but likely the reality check that the stock market needed. Following Huang’s remarks, IonQ’s stock plummeted by around 40%, alongside significant drops in other quantum computing companies. The market reaction highlights the speculative nature of the quantum computing sector and the substantial gap between current capabilities and commercial viability. One of the reasons why I’m bearish is because IonQ operates in an increasingly crowded quantum computing segment, where many companies are likely to struggle to survive in the long term. The quantum computing landscape is teeming with both established tech giants and innovative startups, all vying for dominance in this nascent field. With major players like IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) investing heavily in quantum technology, alongside numerous smaller companies like Rigetti (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), the competition is fierce. The Gartner hype cycle suggests that while there will be winners in quantum computing, there will also be many losers — currently, we appear to be heading towards Gartner’s trough of disillusionment, which is a period after the peak of inflated expectations. Some firms will inevitably run out of funding as they pursue approaches that prove difficult to scale or simply execute their strategies poorly. This is particularly concerning for a company like IonQ, which, despite its innovative trapped-ion approach, faces significant challenges in commercialization and profitability. Furthermore, before the late 2024 bull run that preceded the free fall, pure-play quantum computing stocks were facing several challenges, including talent and funding. While IonQ’s cash reserves provide a decent runway, the company continues to lose money. However, a late 2024 deal worth $54.5 million with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab to develop quantum networking hardware provided a boost to the company’s credentials. As noted, IonQ is expected to remain unprofitable for a while, which reinforces my bearishness as it’s hard to construct a valuation-based thesis when profitability is so many years away. Despite this, its revenue projections are promising. The company’s revenue is forecast to grow significantly, with estimates showing a consistent upward trend from $41.6 million in 2024 to $314.6 million by 2027. This represents a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 96% over the four-year period. Due to this impressive revenue growth, IonQ’s forward price-to-sales ratios are expected to decrease from 167.9x in 2024 to 22.2x in 2027, indicating that the stock’s valuation may become more attractive over time. However, this is still very expensive compared to other parts of the market, and investors should note that the company’s continued losses may pose risks, even as its top line expands rapidly. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Moderate Buy based on four Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price target is $37, implying about 34% upside potential. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m bearish on IonQ despite its innovative technology and promising revenue growth projections. The lengthy timeline for quantum computing commercialization, coupled with the stock’s current valuation, makes it a speculative play. IonQ operates in an intensely competitive sector where many players are unlikely to survive, and its ongoing losses amplify the risks. While analyst ratings highlight some optimism and the company’s partnerships are definitely noteworthy, the broader market challenges and uncertain path to profitability cannot be ignored. Until IonQ demonstrates clearer progress toward scalability and commercial viability, it remains a high-risk investment suited only for incredibly patient, long-term investors. As a result, I’m going to look beyond analysts’ targets on this occasion. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

More green dots have appeared on MicroStrategy’s portfolio tracker. For context, every green dot signals a Bitcoin ($BTC) purchase – of which there have been at least six since December. Michael Saylor announced the last purchase worth $101M on January 6, which brought MicroStrategy’s $BTC Yield to 74.3% in 2024. Yesterday, Saylor posted the Bitcoin BTC$91,214 tracker for the 10th consecutive week, signaling another possible Bitcoin purchase. MicroStrategy’s current $BTC holdings amount to $42.24B, and, according to Saylor’s X account, he’s ‘thinking about the next green dot.’ Despite Saylor’s continued confidence and a long-term bullish outlook, $BTC is facing some strong headwinds right now, trading at $91.3K. Some analysts say Trump’s tariff plans could be at fault, while better employment rates in the US and a stronger dollar have also put pressure on crypto trades. Saylor made a name for himself as a devoted $BTC HODLer. And his faith in $BTC certainly appears to be paying off for MicroStrategy. After all, MSTR stock price grew 468% year-to-date and 2,185% since the company started acquiring crypto. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock price is now so closely correlated with the $BTC value that we can safely call it a ‘$BTC-indexed company’ or a ‘$BTC-correlated investment vehicle.’ This means that a sudden decline in $BTC’s price could decimate MicroStrategy’s shares. Yet, this scenario is unlikely in the upcoming year, given the ongoing bull run and growing institutional adoption of crypto. Saylor recently also gave a 44-slide pitch on why Microsoft should invest $100B yearly on $BTC. We don’t know if Microsoft’s board of directors took Saylor’s advice, but his points were compelling. Saylor argues that by doing so, MSFT stock could add $5T in market cap. Against all expectations, the $BTC rally following Trump’s election victory was short-lived. Instead of hitting $150K, $BTC dipped to $90K. The sharp correction likely results from a stronger dollar, improving employment figures in the US, along with some FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). Indeed, some experts believe uncertainty over Trump’s new economic policies may have also contributed to this downturn. That’s because Frump’s tariffs could further strengthen the dollar. And whenever the dollar strengthens, investor risk appetite weakens. Also, the Fed has no reason to lower interest rates now, after it already cut them by 25 basis points in December. By all accounts, we can expect riskier assets to be on a bumpy ride in the short term, but volatility is nothing new for crypto, and seasoned investors like Saylor know to buy the dip. All of the above draws us to one conclusion – HODL ’til things look up. Whether you want to play it safe with $BTC or invest in new promising projects with potentially higher returns, Best Wallet offers an easy entry into the crypto market. This multi-chain wallet’s standout feature is the presale aggregator, which gives users early access to hot new tokens, including meme coins like $WEPE and $SOLX. Its native token $BEST is now also on presale, with over $7M raised in just a couple of months. $BEST holders will gain governance rights, lower transaction fees, and higher yields in Best Wallet’s staking aggregator. One $BEST now costs $0.023575, but the price will increase in 16 hours. This means now is the last chance to join the Best Wallet ecosystem at the lowest possible price and maximize your profits when the bull run starts up again. It’s easy to criticize MicroStrategy’s investment strategy as reckless, but the results to date speak for themselves. Even if a stronger dollar and Trump’s economic agenda put temporary pressure on the crypto market, the long-term outlook remains bullish. Still, as always, we remind you to DYOR and diversify your portfolio because risk management is critical in every investment. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jobs Report: Bond Yields Rise And Stocks Fall

The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.
