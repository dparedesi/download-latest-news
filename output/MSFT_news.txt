Title: Bitcoin mining news: Cipher lands $5.5B AWS lease, IREN inks $9.7B Microsoft deal, and public bitcoin miner Q3 earnings

It was a blockbuster week for bitcoin mining news, and the clearest sign yet that miners’ AI ambitions are entering the big leagues. Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) inked a $5.5 billion, 15-year lease with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN) for 300 megawatts at its Bear Lake facility, while IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) announced a $9.7 billion, five-year agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for 200 megawatts of cloud compute in Texas. Hashprice tumbled to fresh lows near $40 per petahash per day, Bitcoin retraced to $101,000, and Cipher also unveiled plans for a one-gigawatt data center joint venture. And in the background, Warren Buffett’s Pacific Power failed to deliver power to Amazon, a development that could funnel even more demand toward Bitcoin miners with spare megawatts. You’re reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube. Cipher announced a 15-year, $5.5 billion lease agreement with Amazon Web Services to host AI workloads at its 300-megawatt Bear Lake facility. The site is scheduled to come online in July 2026, marking AWS’s latest move to secure long-term compute capacity amid surging AI demand. The partnership makes Cipher one of the first public Bitcoin miners to land a hyperscaler as a direct tenant. Cipher also revealed plans for a new one-gigawatt data center project dubbed “Colchis,” in which the company will retain a 95% ownership stake. Despite the historic announcement, Cipher’s stock slid more than 10% Friday, caught in a broader tech-sector sell-off. The company’s $5.5 billion deal value dwarfs its own $8 billion market cap, underscoring investor enthusiasm for miners with AI exposure. Concurrent with Cipher’s own deal, IREN signed a five-year, $9.7 billion cloud compute agreement with Microsoft to deliver 200 megawatts of critical IT load at its Childress, Texas site. The company will also collaborate with Dell in a separate $5.8 billion procurement deal to supply servers, cables, and supporting hardware for its new liquid-cooled data centers “Horizon 1” and “Horizon 4.” The twin announcements represent one of the largest combined partnerships between a Bitcoin miner and major tech firms to date. Like Cipher, IREN’s shares fell roughly 10% on the day, but analysts called the Microsoft deal a “watershed moment” for miners pivoting toward AI and HPC infrastructure. The agreement validates the “powershell” model miners are pursuing: providing power and physical infrastructure for AI tenants while leaving GPU cluster management to specialized partners. Still, open questions remain over IREN’s own GPU strategy and its 20,000-unit Neo Cloud cluster, which could serve as a proving ground for independent AI compute capabilities. Beyond the AI headlines, traditional mining economics continued to worsen. Hashprice fell to around $40 per petahash per day, levels not seen since the spring downturn following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Bitcoin’s price has pulled back from highs near $126,000 to roughly $101,000, with network difficulty up more than 6% in the most recent adjustment. “The streets are bleeding,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said. “Hash rice is flatlining, fees are dry, and the only excitement left in mining is AI.” The bleak trend underscores the widening gap between miners chasing compute diversification and those still dependent on Bitcoin block rewards. Q3 results from leading miners offered a snapshot of an industry in transition: With AI contracts now dictating sentiment, shares of several miners appear to be pricing in future deal flow rather than immediate mining economics. In a twist tying Warren Buffett to the week’s biggest AI news, Amazon reportedly filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway–owned Pacific Power for failing to deliver sufficient electricity to new data centers in Oregon. The shortfall, according to Bloomberg, has forced AWS to seek alternative partners, a potential win for miners like Cipher that already control scalable, low-cost energy infrastructure. The incident follows lawsuits against Pacific Power related to wildfire liabilities, adding pressure on the utility as hyperscalers scramble for new capacity. To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home. As U.S. firms repurpose Bitcoin data centers for AI, the global race for compute, and the energy to fuel it, is accelerating on all fronts. Bitcoin’s first industry publication.

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.
