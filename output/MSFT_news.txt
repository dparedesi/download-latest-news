Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

The era of double-digit growth in the stock market may be coming to an end. Goldman Sachs (GS) strategists led by David Kostin estimate that the S&P 500 index will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns in the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. Read More The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major indexes opened lower on Wednesday as the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note continued its upward climb, reaching 4.23%—a level not seen since July. However, there was some relief for investors as oil prices eased, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures trading around $70.65 per barrel. Read More The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn, closely mirroring the decline in the stock market. On Wednesday, Bitcoin saw a significant drop of over 2.5% in the past 24 hours, with its price hovering around $65,000. This decline has dashed hopes of breaking the $70,000 threshold, which had gained traction just a week prior. The downward trajectory underscores the growing volatility in the crypto market and highlights the interconnectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. Read More It was a mixed day for investors, as the Dow dropped over 200 points and the Nasdaq jumped after Tesla’s better-than-expected earnings report. In the afternoon, the Dow dropped 203 points, or 0.4%, to 42,311. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 popped up 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively. Read More The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted approval for the NYSE American LLC and CBOE to list options on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant development in cryptocurrency history. This approval paves the way for institutional investors, or “big fish,” to gain greater access to Bitcoin through more traditional financial products.

The latest batch of major national polls and swing state surveys shows the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is as tight as it's ever been. It also soothes itchy eyes and dry throats while you sleep. Assaf Rappaport, the co-founder and CEO of cloud security startup Wiz, said that turning down a $23 billion offer from Google was “the toughest decision ever,” but justified it by saying the company can get even bigger and reach $100 billion because cloud security is the future. “I think we did the right choice,” Rappaport said on Monday at the annual TechCrunch Disrupt conference. “I'm not sure it's going to be Wiz, but if we do the right things, and we execute, I think it's...in our hands." Speaking on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, Wiz’s CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport, who recently turned down a $23 billion acquisition offer from Google, noted that his employees had been targeted by a deepfake attack just two weeks ago. "Dozens of my employees got a voice message from me," he explained. The team caught on that something wasn't right, however, because the hacker had tracked down audio of the CEO's voice from a conference to create the deepfake. Investors would probably love to hear a more decisive view. But predicting long-term returns is hard, and these kinds of imprecise assessments are the best we can do as we manage our expectations.

Meta (META) will report earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with investors watching whether the social media giant's stock can keep up its strong performance so far this year. Analysts expect Meta to post third-quarter revenue of $40.25 billion, surging nearly 18% year-over-year. Net income is projected to land at $13.56 billion or $5.20 per share, up from $11.58 billion or $4.39 per share a year ago. Meta shares popped after the social media giant reported in July that it's seen early gains from artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize user engagement, benefitting its ad business. Deutsche Bank analysts told clients earlier this month they expect Meta's AI-driven optimization campaign to continue to bring "durable ad wallet share gains.” Meta posted advertising revenue of $38.33 billion in the second quarter, with the Street consensus sitting at $39.54 for the third quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta AI is "on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.” In September, Meta released Llama 3.2, its most capable open-source AI model yet, in its efforts to compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Ahead of the company's earnings call, Bank of America analysts called the social media giant a “top AI pick,” pointing to strong core ad growth, growing core app usage among younger users, and the capability of the company’s large language model. All but one of the 31 analysts covering Meta tracked by Visible Alpha hold a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $612.34, implying about 7% upside from Friday's closing price. Meta shares have surged more than 60% since the start of the year, finishing Friday at $573.25.

Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Title: NUKZ: Brand-New Nuclear Energy ETF is one of 2024’s Hottest ETFs
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nukz-brand-nuclear-energy-etf-064518698.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The brand new Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) is one of the hottest ETFs of 2024, gaining nearly 70% since its launch in January. And while AI and large-cap tech have gotten most of the limelight from investors this year, NUKZ focuses on a different segment of the market entirely – nuclear energy. That said, NUKZ is still an intriguing way to potentially gain backdoor exposure to the growth of AI, the growing need for data centers, and other big tech themes. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to its impressive performance and its exposure to uranium producers, utilities, and manufacturers that are essential for the potential shift toward nuclear energy. This transition is becoming increasingly urgent as the need for sustainable energy solutions becomes more evident. The NUKZ ETF was launched on January 23, 2024, by Range ETFs. It is still a small fund with $40.7 in assets under management (AUM), but it picked a good time to debut as investor interest in nuclear energy is reaching new heights in 2024. According to Range ETFs, NUKZ “is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction & services, and fuel.” Nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, and it is more efficient and reliable than solar or wind energy. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy finds that the typical nuclear plant has a capacity factor of 92.5%, meaning it is working at full capacity 92.5% of the time, versus just 35.4% for wind and a paltry 24.9% for solar. Nuclear energy is a baseload energy source that is more reliable than solar and wind. Consulting firm McKinsey forecasts that electricity demand will triple by 2050, so there is clearly a need for the efficient and clean baseload energy that nuclear can provide. Plus, with so much demand likely to come online, there is room for multiple winners as nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas will all be needed, so this isn’t a zero-sum game. The AI revolution is also putting a finer point on this growing demand for power. More data centers are being built to house the computing power that hyperscalers need to power their AI solutions, and nuclear energy can play a key role in providing them with clean energy. Already, we’ve seen mega-cap tech companies commit to and invest in nuclear energy. Amazon recently announced its support for several new nuclear projects in Washington and Virginia, including the construction of new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an exciting new breed of nuclear reactor with a smaller physical footprint and shorter lead time. Also, Alphabet (GOOG) announced it will buy nuclear power produced by SMRs that will be developed by a company called Kairos Power. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) struck a deal with major power company Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. NUKZ owns 39 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 53.4% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of NUKZ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. The fund’s largest holding is Cameco (CCO), the world’s largest uranium producer. Beyond Cameco, NUKZ also owns utilities like Constellation Energy, which maintains the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States with 21 nuclear reactors. The fund also owns NuScale Power (SMR), which makes the types of small module reactors discussed above. There’s also a place for Industrials, like GE Vernova (GEV) and Honeywell (HON) within the NUKZ ETF. GE Vernova manufactures nuclear turbine islands used by nuclear plants, while Honeywell operates a uranium conversion facility that makes a component needed for the enriched nuclear fuel utilized by nuclear reactors. One word of caution is that as a new ETF with relatively low assets under management, NUKZ is an expensive ETF, charging a fee of 0.85%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay $85 in fees on an annual basis. This is considerably more expensive than the fees many investors are used to seeing with broad-market index ETFs, and well above the average expense ratio for all ETFs (0.52%). If the ETF continues to perform well over the long term, the high expense ratio won’t trouble many holders, but it is something for investors to keep in mind, especially if the ETF’s performance begins to lag. Aside from the high expense ratio, other risks to this investment include the fact that it is a new ETF without a long-term track record, and a very small one at that, so it could prove volatile. Stocks in this space have already had quite a run in 2024, so there could be volatility to the downside. However, overall, I believe this is still a good long-term investment, as we are still in the early stages of the nuclear story. Turning to Wall Street, NUKZ earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average NUKZ stock price target of $42.38 implies about 2.0% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to the increasing demand for clean and efficient baseload energy as electricity consumption rises. The recent embrace of nuclear energy by major tech firms like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft underscores its importance in powering data centers and is attracting new investor interest in these stocks. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of the transition to nuclear energy. While NUKZ has performed well in 2024, there is likely significant upside potential ahead, though volatility is expected along the way. Additionally, NUKZ provides a solid way to gain broad exposure to the nuclear energy sector, investing in uranium producers like Cameco, utilities such as Constellation Energy, and reactor manufacturers like NuScale.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will have its annual shareholders meeting on December 9 and those who are invested in the company will vote on a number of items, according to a Thursday filing by the Securities and Exchange Commission. One of the proposals up for a vote is the "Assessment of investing in Bitcoin," with the board recommending shareholders vote against it. It isn't clear whether the item refers to Microsoft putting Bitcoin, the industry's largest crypto, on its balance sheet. Microsoft did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The filing also notes that "Microsoft's management already carefully considers this topic." Microsoft is one of the world's largest software companies and accepts Bitcoin from customers who are shopping online at its Windows and Xbox stores. If Microsoft does invest in Bitcoin, it will be one of the rare U.S. companies to do so. MicroStrategy, a software company that sells data-analyzing solutions, started buying Bitcoin back in 2020. The Tyson, Virginia-based firm is now the largest corporate holder of the crypto. With 252,220 Bitcoin, currently valued at $17 billion in reserves, its stock has surged this year alongside a rising Bitcoin price. Despite its success for shareholders, many public tech companies have yet to follow suit.

We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Big Tech is going all in on nuclear power as sustainability concerns around AI grow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour. Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.

Title: How To Profit As AI, And Jay Powell, Send Energy Stocks Soaring

Sign at 76 gas station in Lafayette, California, showing high gas prices, February 26, 2018. Parent ... [+] company Phillips 66 ranked number 34 on the 2017 Fortune 500 list. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Last week’s oil-price drop has set us up to buy some top-flight energy dividends on the cheap. We’re going to grab one with a “hidden” 10.3% yield in just a moment. First, this buy window goes well beyond a dip in the price of the goo. Fact is, oil dropped because things calmed (slightly) in the Middle East. But of course, that can change again, and quickly. The real oil story for us is that the drop (along with a double-digit decline in natural-gas prices since the start of October) is happening as energy demand is set to rise. So desperate is the need for energy these days that Big Tech is turning to long-shuttered nuclear reactors. Microsoft (MSFT), for example, recently signed a deal with Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island—site of America’s worst nuclear accident, in 1979—to generate the power needed to satisfy AI’s voracious appetite. Meantime, I continue to believe that a “no-landing” setup is increasingly likely here in the US, in which the economy keeps humming along but inflation comes back. Not great, I know. But the fact is, when the Fed hikes rates, it usually does so until it breaks something—the main example being Paul Volcker, who was so determined to break inflation’s back that under his watch, the federal funds rate hit 22% (!). Inflation was crushed, but the hike sent the US into a deep recession, with unemployment soaring to 11% in 1982. Jay? He “broke” a couple marginal banks that were circling the drain anyway. But that was enough to cause him to blink and pump liquidity into the system through the “back door” while continuing to talk tough on rates, as this chart of bank reserves clearly shows: Liquidity Meantime, as we’ve written about previously, government deficit spending is completely out of control. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Uncle Sam will overwhelm Powell. For fiscal 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a $1.9 trillion deficit on $4.9 trillion in tax receipts. (And yes, this is the CBO that paints its projections with rose-colored ink.) So we have nearly $5 trillion in revenues and almost $7 trillion in expenditures. A 40% overshoot. That $2 trillion is a big reason why the economy remains strong (the latest evidence: last week’s better-than-expected retail sales report and lower than expected jobless claims). But the resulting monetary inflation could flow back into consumer price inflation. Then there’s China, which joined the stimulus party a few weeks back, when its central bank rolled out a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced “stock market support” plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios. Shares of Chinese firms, as well as resources like copper, popped. And while it will take a while for the PBoC’s moves to work through the economy, they’ll likely boost energy demand, too. This is a perfect setup for refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX), since they’re paying less for their main raw material (oil) these days, while demand for their finished products (gasoline, diesel and home-heating oil among them) look set to gain. Investors often misunderstand refiners, confusing them with oil and gas producers. And when they do bother to pay attention to these stocks, it’s usually in the spring, ahead of the summer driving season. (PSX has some 7,260 gas stations in the US and 1,670 outside America’s borders.) That’s too bad for the mainstream crowd, because they’re missing a window on a stock that’s sent its payout up a stout 130% over the last decade, with the only pause coming during the pandemic dumpster fire: PSX Dividend Magnet As you can see, the firm’s share price has struggled to keep up with the surging payout. But I expect that gap to close as PSX’s Dividend Magnet (or the tendency for share prices to track payouts over time) kicks in. Moreover, while we collect that payout, and get ready for more hikes, seasonal demand will swing back PSX’s way as we move through the colder months. The kicker here is that management is all-in when it comes to rewarding shareholders. In addition to its strong payout growth, Phillips 66 is a big repurchaser of its stock—having taken some 23% of its outstanding shares off the market in the last decade. That matters because those buybacks make per-share indicators like earnings per share, free cash flow per share and dividends per share look better. That supports share prices. That tees up the last thing I want to talk to you about today: shareholder yield. Wait, shareholder what? We know from the free screeners out there that PSX’s current dividend yield is around 3.5%. Simple, right? But shareholder yield goes further and includes the value of dividends and buybacks to us. To calculate it, we take the amount spent on buybacks over the last 12 months, minus any cash brought in through share issuances, plus the amount spent on dividends. We then divide the total by PSX’s market cap, or the value of all its outstanding shares. For PSX, the difference between the dividend yield and shareholder yield is dramatic: For the 12 months ended June 30, PSX spent $1.855 billion on dividends and a whopping $3.909 billion on buybacks, with $175 million in share issuances, which we’ll go ahead and subtract. Divide the $4.014-billion total by PSX’s $55.71-billion market cap (as of this writing) and you get a sweet 10.3% shareholder yield. PSX’s shareholder-friendliness is another reason why I see investors moving to this stock, especially as interest rates fall and economic growth—and energy demand—rise.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
