Title: Google earnings are coming Thursday. Here's what to watch

Google (GOOGL+1.23%) parent Alphabet will report first-quarter 2025 earnings Thursday after the bell in what could be a key test for the Nasdaq, given the company’s heavyweight status on the index. The company’s stock has fallen about 16% so far this year, so investors will be tuning in to Thursday’s earnings call to gauge how exactly how confident Google’s leadership is about the company’s future, particularly in the key areas of AI and cloud computing, and amid a host of legal concerns related to antitrust cases. The shares were up slightly in Thursday morning trading, about 1.3%. Google is expected to report Q1 revenue growth of $89.2 billion (an 11% year-over-year increase) and earnings per share of $2.02 (7% ). Despite the company’s dip in stock price over the past year, Wall Street analysts largely remain optimistic about Google’s future. The consensus? Its core business fundamentals are strong. Still, lingering uncertainties have led some big firms to lower price targets ahead of Thursday’s call. ​Top analysts, such as those at TD Cowen (TD+2.73%), UBS (UBS+1.35%), and Scotiabank (BNS+1.58%), have adjusted their 12-month price targets for Alphabet. TD Cowen reduced its target from $210 to $195, while UBS lowered its from $209 to $173, and Scotiabank dropped its from $232 to $200. But despite these more cautious outlooks, all three firms maintain a “buy” rating on the stock. RBC Capital (RY+1.52%) analyst Brad Erickson said in a report that institutional investors have lowered their expectations: “We believe buy side is expecting a (2%-3%) miss, respectively, relative to sell-side estimates of 9% search growth and 8% overall ad growth in Q1.” Google is dealing with a host of swirling questions that analysts are taking into consideration: rising legal risks, trade war and tariff uncertainty, and increasing competition in AI and cloud computing. For investors, the first-quarter earnings report could be a moment of truth: a chance to reset expectations and refocus on the long-term potential of a $1.9 trillion Silicon Valley giant navigating turbulent waters. Google has gotten plenty of headlines lately as it wades its way through a variety of antitrust lawsuits. The search engine giant was back in court this week, related to a ruling that found the company has an illegal monopoly in online search — in part by paying web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to feature its search engine. And the DOJ told the judge it had an eyebrow-raising solution: forcing the company to sell its popular Chrome browser. Google faces other mounting issues that have put the company in an especially vulnerable position. In a separate antitrust case, a federal judge ruled that the company had illegally maintained a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology, which could result in regulatory fines or structural changes to how Google’s ad business operates — and maybe even a break-up. And Japan’s FTC recently sent the company a cease-and-desist order after it said Google’s search practices were monopolistic. On Thursday, analysts will watch closely for any mention of these legal challenges and for what the company’s strategy is for dealing with them beyond what the company has already said — that they’ll appeal. One key feature of Google’s earnings report will likely be how the company has integrated and improved its AI offerings, especially among increased competition in the realm. Investors will look at how the company’s Gemini AI model has been integrated across Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud — and at how the AI will start generating substantial revenue. Jeffries analysts said that Google Cloud is “well positioned to benefit from Gemini AI advances” as the cloud computing suite remains a bit of a highlight for the company. Analysts expect Q1 Google Cloud revenue of almost $12 billion, up 25% year-over-year and slightly below both the Street’s expectation ($12.3 billion) and Q4’s growth rate (30%). However, Google Cloud is still playing catch-up to rivals such as Amazon Web Services (AMZN-1.08%) and Microsoft Azure (MSFT+0.24%). Google has positioned Google Cloud as an AI-first platform, so as more businesses adopt AI technologies, Google hopes to position its software as the go-to provider. If this quarter’s earnings show significant cloud growth, it could signal a breakthrough moment. Analysts will be closely watching for any signs that this strategy has begun to pay off. And analysts will be looking at AI search competition, too, which JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) analyst Doug Anmuth said in a report “remains front and center given the rapidly growing scale of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s more measured pace in disrupting its own search ecosystem.” Google’s advertising business remains the biggest component of the company’s revenue, so investors will look at those numbers to shed light on the current state of the digital advertising market. YouTube and Google Search, the pillars of the company’s ad revenue, are expected to show growth. Analysts predict YouTube’s ad revenue will rise nearly 11% to almost $8 billion. But the company has big hopes for expansion in YouTube Shorts monetization. If it becomes a significant revenue stream, it could help offset any potential slowdown in traditional ad revenue. Analysts remain cautious. Legal challenges, including the recent ruling in federal court that found Google guilty of illegally dominating the market in ad servers and exchanges, could have big implications.

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.
