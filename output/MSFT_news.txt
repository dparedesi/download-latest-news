Title: Watch These Nebius Price Levels as Stock Surges on AI Deal With Microsoft

Nebius Group shares jumped Tuesday after the Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure provider said it has inked an agreement with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius (NBIS) will deliver computing resources to Microsoft (MSFT) later this year using a data center in New Jersey, helping the Azure owner address a demand shortage for cloud infrastructure that can process increasing AI workloads. CEO Arkady Volozh said it’s the first time Nebius had signed a long-term contract with a large tech company, and added that there are likely more to come. Nebius stock was up 37% at $88 in recent trading after hitting an all-time high near $98 in the opening minutes of the session. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2025, boosted in part by news AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a stake in the company. Below we analyze the technicals on the Nebius chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for after the stock’s big move today. After climbing to their highest level in more than three years last month, Nebius shares had consolidated in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation upon a breakout to the upside. That move higher took place on Tuesday, setting the stage for potential follow-through buying. Interestingly, prior to today’s surge, the relative strength index bottomed around its neutral reading, the same level that coincided with the end of a dip in early July. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target to monitor and also point out major support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measured move technique, a study that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying the analysis to the Nebius chart, we measure the percentage change of the steep uptrend from May to August that preceded the pennant and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value, assuming a similar continuation move may play out in the months ahead. For example, we apply a 145% increase to $72, which projects a target of $176.40—implying that the stock could more than double from Monday’s closing price. During retracements, investors should initially watch the $87 level. The stock could be snapped up at this level by investors looking for entry points on a retest of the prominent November 2021 peak, which also marks the stock’s prior all-time high. A close below this level could see the shares fall to support near $76. This area may provide support around the top of the pennant, which also corresponds with a period of trading activity on the chart between September and October 2021. Finally, a more-significant drop in Nebius shares could bring lower support at $54 into play. Investors may seek buying opportunities at this location near the February 2022 countertrend peak and a range of sideways price action on the chart that preceded a notable stock gap last month.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/07/job-growth-sputters-rate-cuts-and-recession-incoming/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Volatility Is Back, And This 7.8% CEF Is Here To Get Us Through It

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
