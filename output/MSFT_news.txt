June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Wall Street is growing even more bullish on Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares set fresh all-time highs Wednesday. In a note to clients Tuesday, Wells Fargo raised its price target to $585 from $565, representing a 19% premium over Microsoft's closing level Tuesday of $490.11—which was itself a record. The climb continued today, as Microsoft shares hit a record intraday level of $494.56 and closed at $492.27. The finish marked the tech titan's 12th record close in 17 June trading sessions. "We acknowledge shares are trading near historical highs, but think this is justified given its early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market," Wells Fargo said, adding, "We still see a bright future ahead for Microsoft." Wedbush was even more bullish Wednesday, raising its price target to $600 from $515. Microsoft has "a massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep" as enterprise clients deploy AI tools, analysts wrote. Wells Fargo and Wedbush are more bullish than average, but they're far from alone. All 19 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for Microsoft stock, with a mean price target of about $532. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect closing prices.

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.
