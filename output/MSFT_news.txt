Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why Microsoft Stock Had One of Its Best Post-Earnings Days in a Decade

Microsoft (MSFT) stock soared on Thursday after the tech giant’s quarterly results handily beat Wall Street estimates. Shares closed up 7.6% at $425.20, a jump that marks the stock’s second-best post-earnings performance in nearly 10 years. The last time Microsoft stock popped significantly more than that on earnings was in October 2015 when the company reported revenue from its nascent Azure cloud computing business had more than doubled from the prior year, and shares surged 10%. Wall Street on Thursday was cheering strong results in each of Microsoft’s major business lines. Sales at the company’s cloud computing unit rose 22% in constant currency (cc) terms to nearly $27 billion. Revenue at its productivity and business software unit also grew double digits, and even devices revenue—a soft spot for most tech companies of late—increased 3%.(cc) But it was the Azure business, Microsoft's cloud computing and AI platform, that really excited Wall Street. Azure growth accelerated to 35% (cc) in the quarter, well ahead of analysts' forecasts. CFO Amy Hood on Wednesday's earnings call noted that, despite recent economic uncertainty, AI demand continued to grow faster than Microsoft's supply. Hood's warning helped to assuage some fear on Wall Street that macroeconomic headwinds would stunt AI growth. The AI stocks that tumbled from their record highs earlier this year—like chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and nuclear power providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST)—led Thursday's rally. Analysts at BMO raised their price target to $485 on Thursday morning, citing “improved Azure growth.” Bank of America Securities analysts noted Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI was a major driver behind the Azure beat, “which should allay fears that the partnership has frayed a bit.” The firm raised its price target on the stock by 7% to $515, and reiterated its “top pick” call. “We remain confident that MSFT's revenue growth opportunities over the medium-term and beyond are greater than many realize, and we continue to be very bullish on its tangible GenAI adoption and monetization levers,” Mizuho Americas analysts wrote on Thursday as they raised their price target to $500.

Microsoft (MSFT) shares surged Thursday after the company posted what Morgan Stanley called “one of their strongest quarters in recent memory,” on growth fueled by demand for cloud computing and AI. Microsoft shares were up nearly 9% in recent trading to about $430, pushing them into positive territory for 2025. Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $482 from $472 following the results, which beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations across all segments. “We remain strong buyers of this GenAI winner,” the analysts said. “Bottom-line, while the macro presents uncertainty, Microsoft appears poised to yield on GenAI investments which should support share gains and more durable growth ahead.” Bank of America maintained a $515 target, and noted earlier-than-expected returns on Microsoft’s infrastructure investments. During Microsoft’s earnings call Wednesday, CFO Amy Hood reiterated the company's plan to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in fiscal 2025. Hood said demand for AI has continued to grow, to the point Microsoft expects “to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.” Meanwhile, Jefferies boosted its target to a more bullish $550 and Wedbush moved to $515, both from $475 previously. “We are laser focused on the AI piece of this MSFT story,” Wedbush said. “All metrics were ahead of expectations which give us added confidence in the AI Revolution bull thesis.”

Title: McDonald's has a warning about the economy

McDonald’s stock price declined more than 1% on Thursday on disappointing first-quarter results, as broad economic pressures weighed on customers and kept them away. The iconic chain’s U.S. same-store sales dropped 3.6% — a rare miss uncomfortably recalling a similar drop during the 2020 pandemic. Global comparable sales slipped 1%. Total revenue declined 3% to $5.96 billion, while earnings dipped 2% to $2.60 per share. “Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings release, calling out macro pressures as guest counts underwhelmed – i.e., as customers skipped their Big Macs and fries. Management was careful to note that the absence of Leap Day distorted year-over-year comparisons, because when you’re the size of McDonald’s, even one fewer sales day per year makes a difference. But the broader story was one of anxious consumers. International results were uneven. Japan and the Middle East helped McDonald’s licensed markets grow 3.5%, but U.K. consumers seemed particularly cautious, dragging down company-operated regions. It wasn’t all bad news, however. One bright spot was McDonald’s digital loyalty program, which drove $8 billion in systemwide sales this quarter and more than $31 billion over the past year — proof that customer engagement remains strong, even as wallets tighten. Those app-based deals for $1.29 any-size fries and 20% off orders over $12 are simply hard to ignore, and become all the more compelling as wallets tighten. McDonald’s joins a growing list of consumer-facing brands flashing warning signs. Harley-Davidson (HOG) yanked its full-year guidance Thursday, citing tariff fears. Starbucks (SBUX) saw shrinking margins and slowing traffic. Sysco (SYY), the largest restaurant supplier in the U.S. and UK, also missed, suggesting a burgeoning restaurant recession cutting across both the higher and lower ends of the markets. Consumer confidence just saw its sharpest drop in years. Meanwhile on Thursday, Wall Street – a part of it, anyway — is roaring. Big Tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) have powered the Nasdaq higher, with Microsoft up 9% and Meta gaining over 6%. As investors chase AI growth and bet on hyper-scaling, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street looks to be growing starker. And for companies relying on middle- and lower-income, discretionary spending, the squeeze is here — and it’s showing up in the numbers.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock rose sharply Thursday morning, a day after the tech giant blew past Wall Street’s expectations in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. The stock was up about 9% in mid-morning trading. It’s now up about 3% so far this year, having fully recovered from April’s trade war-induced bloodbath in tech stocks. Microsoft racked up $70.1 billion in revenue, up 13%, and $25.8 billion in net income, up 18%, fueled by relentless demand for cloud and AI. Earnings came in at $3.46 per share, easily topping consensus estimates of $3.22. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Microsoft’s cloud engine kept roaring in Q3, with Azure and other cloud services surging 33% year-over-year, powering a 21% increase in the all-important Intelligent Cloud segment, which hit $26.8 billion. Server product revenue rose 22% as demand for AI infrastructure stayed hot. The Productivity and Business Processes segment brought in $29.9 billion, up 10% from last year, driven by steady growth in Microsoft 365 and Dynamics. Microsoft 365 Commercial revenue rose 11%, with its cloud-based suite climbing 12%, while consumer revenue grew 10%. Dynamics 365 jumped 16%, lifting Dynamics overall by 11%. On an earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era. In other words, hyperscaling has arrived — and it seems here to stay. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Microsoft (MSFT) didn’t just beat expectations in its fiscal third quarter — it delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” performance that could help reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Here are key takeaways investors are digesting Thursday morning: On the earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Commercial bookings jumped 17% in constant currency, while Microsoft’s commercial remaining performance obligation (i.e., revenue that the company is contractually owed but hasn’t collected yet) surged 34% to $315 billion. That growing backlog signals a strong pipeline of future revenue. Management cited enterprise wins, including Coca-Cola (KO), BNY Mellon (BK), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), and noted that Microsoft now processes over 100 trillion tokens per quarter. Its internal Foundry AI platform has 70,000 enterprise developers onboard. Cost and efficiency metrics also impressed. The cost per token (a key AI efficiency stat) has more than halved, while AI performance across Microsoft’s data center fleet is up 30% on the same power footprint. Capital expenditures came in slightly below some forecasts, but Microsoft reaffirmed its $80 billion full-year FY25 guidance and expects spending to climb again in FY26 to meet hyperscale demand. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era.

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: More Upside For MSFT Stock After An Impressive Q3?

The Microsoft logo is displayed on a screen during a speech by Microsoft vice-chair and president ... More "digital resilience in a time of geopolitical volatility" at the Atlantic Council, in Brussels on April 30, 2025. (Photo by Nicolas TUCAT / AFP) (Photo by NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has recently announced its fiscal Q3 2025 results (the fiscal year concludes in June), with both revenue and earnings surpassing expectations. The company reported $70.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $3.46 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $68.4 billion and $3.22, respectively. Microsoft continued to benefit from rising sales of Azure cloud computing services. Furthermore, the outlook for the fourth quarter surpassed street expectations, contributing to the increase in the stock price following the earnings announcement. We believe that MSFT still has additional growth potential despite its recent gains. Even with a 6% decline year-to-date (as of April 30th), Microsoft’s (MSFT) stock performance has been a bit better than that of the broader NASDAQ index, which has dropped by 10%. We expect Microsoft will experience a relatively smaller effect from the existing tariff situation in comparison to many other technology firms—a resilience reflected in the company's positive outlook. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than holding an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. Microsoft’s revenue of $70.1 billion in Q1 represented a 13% year-over-year increase. Analyzing the segments, sales in Productivity and Business Processes rose by 10% to $29.9 billion, driven by increased sales of Microsoft 365 products and LinkedIn solutions. Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment grew by 21% to $26.8 billion, primarily due to Azure and other cloud offerings. Finally, sales in More Personal Computing increased by 6% to $13.4 billion, driven by growth in Windows OEM and devices, along with higher gaming sales. Microsoft saw a 33% rise in revenue from Azure and cloud services. The company not only experienced higher sales but also expanded its operating margin by 110 basis points year-over-year to 45.7%. Increased revenues, combined with margin expansion, led to earnings of $3.46 per share, an 18% increase year-over-year. Looking ahead, Microsoft anticipates its Q4 revenue to be around $73.7 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $72.3 billion. This projection accounts for a 34% to 35% growth in Azure, compared to the anticipated 31%. A strong Q3 and a positive outlook were well-received by investors, resulting in a 7% surge in MSFT stock during after-hours trading. However, assessing a slightly longer timeframe, the increase in MSFT stock over the past four years has been far from steady, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than the S&P 500. The returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -28% in 2022, 58% in 2023, and 13% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 comfortably over the last four years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered better returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index; demonstrating less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment concerning tariffs and trade wars, could MSFT encounter a similar scenario as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a substantial increase? Despite its recent rise, we believe MSFT stock has further room for growth. We estimate Microsoft’s Valuation at $500 per share, indicating a potential upside of nearly 18% from its current after-hours trading price of $423. This forecast is grounded on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39x applied to the trailing twelve-month earnings per share of $12.94. Although the current P/E ratio of 39x exceeds the stock’s four-year average of 35x, we believe this elevated valuation is warranted given the anticipated earnings growth driven by increasing contributions from its Cloud business. While MSFT stock appears to have room for more growth, it is useful to examine how Microsoft’s Peers perform on important metrics.
