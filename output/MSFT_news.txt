We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). manaemedia / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 Barclays recently highlighted what Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) could gain in the search market in certain scenarios of the outcome of the DoJ’s case against Google. “With Bing being a small part of the Microsoft top-line (5% of total revenue in FY24), the ramifications of any developments here seem to have been largely ignored based on our investor discussions, particularly with many software investors not having the context of the ongoing trial,” analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note to clients. “However, following the Department of Justice’s long-awaited Proposed Final Judgment, we think that Microsoft investors should pay closer attention to any final rulings that come from the case.” Lenschow, who has an Overweight rating and a $475 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), noted that if the remedies include ending revenue-sharing agreements between Google and other parties, or if Google starts syndicating its search offering, Bing could gain market share. This might force Google to make some of its technology stack available to partners and offer search text ads for one year to U.S. partners while keeping just 10% of gross revenue. “In tandem with this, Google is only allowed to syndicate 25% of search text ads, meaning that partners (like an Apple) would need to backfill their remaining search ads either through their own tech stack or through a new partner like Bing,” Lenschow added. “This, in theory, would open up a unique opportunity for Microsoft to capture share for a period of time.” Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management’s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Strategy: Here’s What Michael Saylor Told Microsoft’s Leadership
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-what-michael-saylor-told-microsoft/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T07:15:21Z

Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy and a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, has held his 3-minute presentation to the Microsoft (MSFT) Board of Directors and CEO Satya Nadella, articulating why the company should adopt BTC as a reserve asset. Saylor, who was invited to present his insights, emphasized the critical importance of embracing the leading cryptocurrency as a cornerstone of modern financial strategy. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared at the outset of his presentation. He continued, “Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century. It represents digital capital.” Delving into the mechanics of global wealth distribution, Saylor highlighted the dichotomy between utility-providing assets and those dedicated to capital preservation. “Global wealth is distributed across assets that provide utility and others that preserve Capital, but risk is destroying trillions of dollars of that Capital every single year,” he explained. Saylor articulated BTC’s superiority over traditional forms of capital preservation, stating, “Digital capital is economically and technically superior to physical capital, and it represents a revolutionary advance in capital preservation.” He projected a significant expansion of Bitcoin as asset class, asserting, “The asset class itself is growing from trillions to hundreds of trillions of dollars and it is backed by digital power along with political and economic power.” Addressing the strategic financial decisions faced by large corporations like Microsoft, Saylor made a strong case for BTC’s central role. “It makes sense for Microsoft to be powered by digital capital. Bitcoin’s the best asset you can own. The numbers speak for themselves,” he stated unequivocally. He contrasted a BTC investment with traditional corporate financial maneuvers, arguing, “it makes a lot more sense to buy Bitcoin than to buy your own stock back or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds if you’re going to outperform. You’re going to need Bitcoin and those bonds are undermining your options market and your equity liquidity.” Saylor also underscored the burgeoning institutional and governmental support, reinforcing its viability as a strategic asset. “Luckily you have an alternative. Public support for Bitcoin is surging, as is political support, as is support for the US Bitcoin strategic reserve, as is Wall Street support and the president of the United States says ‘never sell your Bitcoin.’” Framing the current period as a transformative era, Saylor proclaimed, “We’re entering year one of the crypto Renaissance and you have a choice to make: cling to the past or embrace the future.” He cautioned against the financial stagnation associated with traditional investment strategies, stating, “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face.” He added, “if you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk. What if you could buy a hundred billion dollar company growing faster than Microsoft for one time revenue? What if you could keep doing it every single year? it’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options.” To facilitate the integration of BTC into Microsoft’s financial operations, Saylor also introduced an open-source model. “We’ve created an open-source model, you can plug in your own assumptions. You can convert your cash flows and your dividends and your buybacks and your debt into Bitcoin,” he explained. He projected substantial financial benefits from this integration, claiming, “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price. You can create trillions of dollars of enterprise value. You can strip away risk from your shareholders and you can prosper on the Bitcoin standard. So do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” The community reactions have been swift and varied following Saylor’s presentation. Luke Broyles from The Bitcoin Adviser commented via X: “58 slides in 191 seconds… or 3.2 seconds per slide. It is brilliant, hilarious, and frankly sad that Microsoft would only allow a 3 minute presentation from Michael Saylor. Brilliant to cover so many slides so investors/shareholders have to review them all. Hilarious that he was actually able to do it.” As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft shareholders are currently voting on whether the company should invest in BTC. The proposal, prompted by a shareholder initiative, suggests using corporate funds to purchase BTC. Microsoft’s board of directors has urged shareholders to reject the proposal, arguing against the strategic fit and potential risks associated with an investment. Shareholders can participate in the voting process online via proxy ahead of Microsoft’s annual shareholder meeting on December 10, 2024. At press time, BTC traded at $96,331.
