That's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year. He's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an "inflection point" next year, he write in a new note to clients. "While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026," Ives said. His picks are detailed below: Ticker: MSFT 2025 performance: +16% Wedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside) Rationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an "AI driven shift" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026. "While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments." Ticker: AAPL 2025 performance: +11% Wedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside) Rationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated. "The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts," he wrote. Ticker: TSLA 2025 performance: +19% Wedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside) Rationale: 2026 could be a "monster year" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year. "We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026," Wedbush said. Ticker: PLTR 2025 performance: +140% Wedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside) Rationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains "unprecedented," Ives said. "With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution." Ticker: CRWD 2025 performance: +36% Wedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside) Rationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite. "CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names," Ives said. "We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness."

Title: Five Tech Stocks Set To Boom in 2026, According to Wedbush’s Dan Ives

Hedge fund veteran Dan Ives is revealing his top five tech stock picks for 2026. In a new CNBC Squawk Box interview, Ives says that artificial intelligence (AI) will likely cause the following five tech companies to outperform next year: Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Apple (AAPL). “It’s about the derivatives of the AI revolution playing out. That’s our whole thesis going into 2026. For every dollar spent on a NVIDIA chip, there’s an eight to 10 multiplier across the rest of tech. And that’s why I think those five are the ones specifically going into early part of ’26 that I think are going to boom. That’s why we pound the table on those five names.” Ives says that Microsoft, which closed at $487 on Tuesday, may soon soar into the $500 range. “When you look at enterprise, as you see the movements in the cloud and AI, [Microsoft’s] really owning that race. I think this is a stock [with a] $100 upside.” He also says that Apple, which is trading for around $273 at time of writing, could see AI innovation drive its price into the $300 range. “[Apple’s] been nowhere in AI. But now, as we go into ’26, we expect a major Google partnership in terms of the spring. Now, the consumer AI revolution goes through [Apple’s headquarters in] Cupertino, and I think that is significant. We talk about a $75 incremental in the stock is the AI multiple. That starts to increase for Apple. That’s why I view that as just a glaring name that sticks out.” Lastly, Ives says that Tesla, which closed the market Tuesday at $454 per share, will likely surge due to advancements with its autonomous vehicles and robotics. “The whole story is the autonomous chapters now coming to Tesla, and I think it’s going be the most important year in its history for [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla… We think autonomous is worth a trillion dollars alone to the Tesla story… I think Tesla’s front and center in terms of physical AI. That’s why we love that name.” CrowdStrike closed on Tuesday at $475, up more than 39% year to date. Meanwhile, Palantir was trading at $180 at market close, up more than 139% year to date.
