This development has prompted questions about the company’s long-term requirements for AI computing capacity. Notably, Microsoft recently reiterated its commitment to an $80 billion capital expenditure plan for the current fiscal year, ending in June, with a signficant portion of that investment directed towards the construction of data centers designed to support AI workloads. MSFT stock declined 1% in a week, and at its current levels of around $400, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.
