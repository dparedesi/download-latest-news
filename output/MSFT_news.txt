Apple (AAPL-5.92%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-0.99%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-3.35%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-8.68%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-9.07%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-5.92%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-0.99%), 3.7% for Meta (META-3.35%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-8.68%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-2.15%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-1.04%). Palantir (PLTR-10.54%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-3.10%) and Stellantis (STLA-4.11%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.13%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.
