Title: Why Microsoft Stock Had One of Its Best Post-Earnings Days in a Decade

Microsoft (MSFT) stock soared on Thursday after the tech giant’s quarterly results handily beat Wall Street estimates. Shares closed up 7.6% at $425.20, a jump that marks the stock’s second-best post-earnings performance in nearly 10 years. The last time Microsoft stock popped significantly more than that on earnings was in October 2015 when the company reported revenue from its nascent Azure cloud computing business had more than doubled from the prior year, and shares surged 10%. Wall Street on Thursday was cheering strong results in each of Microsoft’s major business lines. Sales at the company’s cloud computing unit rose 22% in constant currency (cc) terms to nearly $27 billion. Revenue at its productivity and business software unit also grew double digits, and even devices revenue—a soft spot for most tech companies of late—increased 3%.(cc) But it was the Azure business, Microsoft's cloud computing and AI platform, that really excited Wall Street. Azure growth accelerated to 35% (cc) in the quarter, well ahead of analysts' forecasts. CFO Amy Hood on Wednesday's earnings call noted that, despite recent economic uncertainty, AI demand continued to grow faster than Microsoft's supply. Hood's warning helped to assuage some fear on Wall Street that macroeconomic headwinds would stunt AI growth. The AI stocks that tumbled from their record highs earlier this year—like chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and nuclear power providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST)—led Thursday's rally. Analysts at BMO raised their price target to $485 on Thursday morning, citing “improved Azure growth.” Bank of America Securities analysts noted Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI was a major driver behind the Azure beat, “which should allay fears that the partnership has frayed a bit.” The firm raised its price target on the stock by 7% to $515, and reiterated its “top pick” call. “We remain confident that MSFT's revenue growth opportunities over the medium-term and beyond are greater than many realize, and we continue to be very bullish on its tangible GenAI adoption and monetization levers,” Mizuho Americas analysts wrote on Thursday as they raised their price target to $500.

Microsoft (MSFT) shares surged Thursday after the company posted what Morgan Stanley called “one of their strongest quarters in recent memory,” on growth fueled by demand for cloud computing and AI. Microsoft shares were up nearly 9% in recent trading to about $430, pushing them into positive territory for 2025. Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $482 from $472 following the results, which beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations across all segments. “We remain strong buyers of this GenAI winner,” the analysts said. “Bottom-line, while the macro presents uncertainty, Microsoft appears poised to yield on GenAI investments which should support share gains and more durable growth ahead.” Bank of America maintained a $515 target, and noted earlier-than-expected returns on Microsoft’s infrastructure investments. During Microsoft’s earnings call Wednesday, CFO Amy Hood reiterated the company's plan to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in fiscal 2025. Hood said demand for AI has continued to grow, to the point Microsoft expects “to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.” Meanwhile, Jefferies boosted its target to a more bullish $550 and Wedbush moved to $515, both from $475 previously. “We are laser focused on the AI piece of this MSFT story,” Wedbush said. “All metrics were ahead of expectations which give us added confidence in the AI Revolution bull thesis.”

Title: McDonald's has a warning about the economy

McDonald’s stock price declined more than 1% on Thursday on disappointing first-quarter results, as broad economic pressures weighed on customers and kept them away. The iconic chain’s U.S. same-store sales dropped 3.6% — a rare miss uncomfortably recalling a similar drop during the 2020 pandemic. Global comparable sales slipped 1%. Total revenue declined 3% to $5.96 billion, while earnings dipped 2% to $2.60 per share. “Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings release, calling out macro pressures as guest counts underwhelmed – i.e., as customers skipped their Big Macs and fries. Management was careful to note that the absence of Leap Day distorted year-over-year comparisons, because when you’re the size of McDonald’s, even one fewer sales day per year makes a difference. But the broader story was one of anxious consumers. International results were uneven. Japan and the Middle East helped McDonald’s licensed markets grow 3.5%, but U.K. consumers seemed particularly cautious, dragging down company-operated regions. It wasn’t all bad news, however. One bright spot was McDonald’s digital loyalty program, which drove $8 billion in systemwide sales this quarter and more than $31 billion over the past year — proof that customer engagement remains strong, even as wallets tighten. Those app-based deals for $1.29 any-size fries and 20% off orders over $12 are simply hard to ignore, and become all the more compelling as wallets tighten. McDonald’s joins a growing list of consumer-facing brands flashing warning signs. Harley-Davidson (HOG) yanked its full-year guidance Thursday, citing tariff fears. Starbucks (SBUX) saw shrinking margins and slowing traffic. Sysco (SYY), the largest restaurant supplier in the U.S. and UK, also missed, suggesting a burgeoning restaurant recession cutting across both the higher and lower ends of the markets. Consumer confidence just saw its sharpest drop in years. Meanwhile on Thursday, Wall Street – a part of it, anyway — is roaring. Big Tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) have powered the Nasdaq higher, with Microsoft up 9% and Meta gaining over 6%. As investors chase AI growth and bet on hyper-scaling, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street looks to be growing starker. And for companies relying on middle- and lower-income, discretionary spending, the squeeze is here — and it’s showing up in the numbers.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock rose sharply Thursday morning, a day after the tech giant blew past Wall Street’s expectations in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. The stock was up about 9% in mid-morning trading. It’s now up about 3% so far this year, having fully recovered from April’s trade war-induced bloodbath in tech stocks. Microsoft racked up $70.1 billion in revenue, up 13%, and $25.8 billion in net income, up 18%, fueled by relentless demand for cloud and AI. Earnings came in at $3.46 per share, easily topping consensus estimates of $3.22. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Microsoft’s cloud engine kept roaring in Q3, with Azure and other cloud services surging 33% year-over-year, powering a 21% increase in the all-important Intelligent Cloud segment, which hit $26.8 billion. Server product revenue rose 22% as demand for AI infrastructure stayed hot. The Productivity and Business Processes segment brought in $29.9 billion, up 10% from last year, driven by steady growth in Microsoft 365 and Dynamics. Microsoft 365 Commercial revenue rose 11%, with its cloud-based suite climbing 12%, while consumer revenue grew 10%. Dynamics 365 jumped 16%, lifting Dynamics overall by 11%. On an earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era. In other words, hyperscaling has arrived — and it seems here to stay. —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Microsoft (MSFT) didn’t just beat expectations in its fiscal third quarter — it delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” performance that could help reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Here are key takeaways investors are digesting Thursday morning: On the earnings call, executives offered a confident and detailed account of accelerating enterprise demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that while most of the quarter’s upside came from non-AI services, digital-native companies are increasingly building everything — AI or not — in Azure. The result: a seamless pipeline converting Microsoft’s massive capital expenditures into revenue faster than skeptics expected. Commercial bookings jumped 17% in constant currency, while Microsoft’s commercial remaining performance obligation (i.e., revenue that the company is contractually owed but hasn’t collected yet) surged 34% to $315 billion. That growing backlog signals a strong pipeline of future revenue. Management cited enterprise wins, including Coca-Cola (KO), BNY Mellon (BK), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), and noted that Microsoft now processes over 100 trillion tokens per quarter. Its internal Foundry AI platform has 70,000 enterprise developers onboard. Cost and efficiency metrics also impressed. The cost per token (a key AI efficiency stat) has more than halved, while AI performance across Microsoft’s data center fleet is up 30% on the same power footprint. Capital expenditures came in slightly below some forecasts, but Microsoft reaffirmed its $80 billion full-year FY25 guidance and expects spending to climb again in FY26 to meet hyperscale demand. Wedbush raised its price target on the stock 8.4%, from $475 to $515, noting that chatter around potential data center pullbacks is now “put to rest.” As the line between AI and non-AI workloads continues to blur — and AI demand proves strong even amid an uncertain macro picture — Microsoft looks to be increasingly positioning itself as the core infrastructure provider of the AI era. In other words, hyperscaling has arrived — and it seems here to stay.

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: More Upside For MSFT Stock After An Impressive Q3?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Microsoft logo is displayed on a screen during a speech by Microsoft vice-chair and president ... More "digital resilience in a time of geopolitical volatility" at the Atlantic Council, in Brussels on April 30, 2025. (Photo by Nicolas TUCAT / AFP) (Photo by NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has recently announced its fiscal Q3 2025 results (the fiscal year concludes in June), with both revenue and earnings surpassing expectations. The company reported $70.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $3.46 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $68.4 billion and $3.22, respectively. Microsoft continued to benefit from rising sales of Azure cloud computing services. Furthermore, the outlook for the fourth quarter surpassed street expectations, contributing to the increase in the stock price following the earnings announcement. We believe that MSFT still has additional growth potential despite its recent gains. Even with a 6% decline year-to-date (as of April 30th), Microsoft’s (MSFT) stock performance has been a bit better than that of the broader NASDAQ index, which has dropped by 10%. We expect Microsoft will experience a relatively smaller effect from the existing tariff situation in comparison to many other technology firms—a resilience reflected in the company's positive outlook. However, if you seek an upside with a smoother experience than holding an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. Microsoft’s revenue of $70.1 billion in Q1 represented a 13% year-over-year increase. Analyzing the segments, sales in Productivity and Business Processes rose by 10% to $29.9 billion, driven by increased sales of Microsoft 365 products and LinkedIn solutions. Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment grew by 21% to $26.8 billion, primarily due to Azure and other cloud offerings. Finally, sales in More Personal Computing increased by 6% to $13.4 billion, driven by growth in Windows OEM and devices, along with higher gaming sales. Microsoft saw a 33% rise in revenue from Azure and cloud services. The company not only experienced higher sales but also expanded its operating margin by 110 basis points year-over-year to 45.7%. Increased revenues, combined with margin expansion, led to earnings of $3.46 per share, an 18% increase year-over-year. Looking ahead, Microsoft anticipates its Q4 revenue to be around $73.7 billion, exceeding the consensus estimate of $72.3 billion. This projection accounts for a 34% to 35% growth in Azure, compared to the anticipated 31%. A strong Q3 and a positive outlook were well-received by investors, resulting in a 7% surge in MSFT stock during after-hours trading. However, assessing a slightly longer timeframe, the increase in MSFT stock over the past four years has been far from steady, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than the S&P 500. The returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -28% in 2022, 58% in 2023, and 13% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile. Moreover, it has outperformed the S&P 500 comfortably over the last four years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered better returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index; demonstrating less volatility, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment concerning tariffs and trade wars, could MSFT encounter a similar scenario as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a substantial increase? Despite its recent rise, we believe MSFT stock has further room for growth. We estimate Microsoft’s Valuation at $500 per share, indicating a potential upside of nearly 18% from its current after-hours trading price of $423. This forecast is grounded on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39x applied to the trailing twelve-month earnings per share of $12.94. Although the current P/E ratio of 39x exceeds the stock’s four-year average of 35x, we believe this elevated valuation is warranted given the anticipated earnings growth driven by increasing contributions from its Cloud business. While MSFT stock appears to have room for more growth, it is useful to examine how Microsoft’s Peers perform on important metrics. Additional valuable comparisons for companies across various industries can be found at Peer Comparisons.

Title: I Don’t Get GitLab’s Stock Valuation

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MARCH 3: In this photo illustration, the GitLab Inc. logo is displayed on a ... More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting GitLab's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the software development, DevOps, and cloud computing sectors, on March 3, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) I originally put Gitlab Inc. (GTLB) in the Danger Zone on October 8, 2021 prior to its IPO. Since the company’s IPO, it has outperformed as a short. Despite the outperformance as a short, this stock remains dangerous. After analyzing GitLab’s fiscal year 2025 10-K, my short thesis still stands. The company is dwarfed by its competition, remains unprofitable, and its stock price is too expensive and offers much more downside risk than upside potential. GitLab grew its total revenue 31% year-over-year (YoY) in fiscal 2025. Additionally, in fiscal 2025, the number of customers that generate: The company also beat on both the top- and bottom-line when it reported fiscal 4Q25 results. Just focusing on top-line growth, rather than trends, would be short-sighted. For instance, the customer segments noted above all grew at lower YoY growth rates in fiscal 2025 than in fiscal 2024. Slowing top-line growth is just one of the concerns of investing in GitLab at current levels, as I’ll show below. The freemium business model has been around for many years, and industry analysis estimates that most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have a 2%-5% freemium conversion rate. Conversion rate refers to the percentage of free users converted into paying users. There’s no doubt GitLab has successfully attracted users. Its total registered users have increased from an estimated 30 million in fiscal 2024 to “more than 50 million” in fiscal 2025. Over the same time, GitLab’s base customers, which are the customers that generate more than $5,000 in ARR, increased from 8,602 to 9,893. In other words, in a time when the company’s reported estimate of registered users increased 20 million, its base customers increased by 1,291, much less than the average 2-5% conversion noted above. The number of customers that generate higher ARR is also still a small portion of the company’s base customers. In fiscal 2025, the number of customers that generate more than $100,000 and more than $1 million in ARR were 1,229 and 123, respectively. GitLab’s revenue is largely dependent on converting free users into paying users. The fact that the company converts so few continues to be alarming. Figure 1: GitLab’s Revenue and NOPAT: Fiscal 2020 – 2025 GTLB Revenue & NOPAT As GitLab converts fewer free users to paid users, the recurring revenue generated by existing users is growing at slower rates in recent years. The company measures its ability to retain and expand revenue generated by its existing customers in the form of dollar-based net retention rate, which is calculated by the dividing the current period ARR by the previous period ARR derived from its customer base at a point in time. GitLab’s dollar-based net retention rate fell from over 145% in fiscal 2021 to 123% in fiscal 2025. See Figure 2. Figure 2: GitLab’s Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate: Fiscal 2021 – Fiscal 2025 GTLB Retention Rate 2021-2025 GitLab’s closest competition comes from industry giant Microsoft (MSFT), which owns GitHub after acquiring the company in 2018. Other competitors include large tech/cloud players such as Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM), and Atlassian Corp (TEAM). The broad cloud services market is dominated by established tech companies that are consistently looking to take market share. More specifically, GitLab operates in the DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) market, which is a segment of the infrastructure as a service industry. The global DevSecOps market size was estimated to be worth $8.8 billion in 2024, which would give GitLab an approximate market share of 9% based on revenue. On the user front, Gitlab’s estimated 50 million registered users would still be half of the 100 million users GitHub reported in 2023. To calculate GitLab’s estimated current market share, I divided the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue (ending January 31, 2025) of $759 million by the global DevSecOps market size at the end of 2024, which was $8.8 billion. Not only do industry incumbents have more users and resources than GitLab, but they are significantly more profitable. Even though GitLab’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) has improved, it is still negative. Per Figure 3, GitLab has the lowest NOPAT margin and return on invested capital (ROIC) in the industry. Figure 3: GitLab’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM GTLB Profitability Vs Peers Taking market share in an industry mainly occupied by behemoths will be hard for GitLab, especially considering that GitLab’s revenue is 100% dependent on its DevSecOps operations, while its competitors have many other revenue streams and are more profitable. On top of negative NOPAT, GitLab is burning cash. Since fiscal 2021, GitLab’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year except one (it generated $7 million in FCF in fiscal 2024). On a quarterly basis, Gitlab’s FCF has been negative in 11 of the 12 quarters in my company model. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, GitLab has burned through a cumulative $1.4 billion (16% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 4. Following the same trend, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business that take into account changes to the balance sheet, fell from -$163 in fiscal 2020 to -$194 in fiscal 2025. Figure 4: GitLab’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since Fiscal 2021 GTLB Cumulative FCF Since 2021 Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into GitLab’s stock price. GitLab’s stock is priced as if it will grow revenue at accelerated rates and will 5x its current market share in the DevSecOps industry. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if GitLab fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of $48/share, my model shows GitLab would have to: In this scenario, GitLab would generate $13.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2035, which is 17x the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue. This scenario also implies GitLab’s NOPAT would reach $2.2 billion in fiscal 2035, compared to the company’s -$93 million NOPAT in fiscal 2025. For reference, ServiceNow (NOW), a much larger and profitable SaaS company, generated $1.2 billion in NOPAT in 2024. The implied revenue in this scenario would be 40% of the estimated global DevSecOps market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated market share of 9% in 2024. To estimate the global DevSecOps market size in 2034, I assume the industry continues to grow at the projected 2025-2030 industry CAGR of 13.2% from 2031-2034 to calculate a projected market size of $33.2 billion. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in GitLab’s share price even more unrealistic. If I instead assume GitLab: the stock would be worth $30/share today – a 38% downside to the current price. In this scenario, GitLab would grow revenue to $7.7 billion in fiscal 2035, which would be over 10x the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue. This scenario also implies GitLab achieves a NOPAT of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2035, which is still far above the company’s NOPAT in fiscal 2025. $1.3 billion in NOPAT would be almost 3x higher than Workday’s (WDAY) fiscal 2025 NOPAT. The implied revenue in this second scenario would represent 23% of the DevSecOps market in 2034, which is still nearly triple the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume GitLab: the stock would be worth just $12/share today – a 75% downside to the current price. Figure 5 compares GitLab’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For additional comparison, I include the TTM NOPAT of profitable SaaS companies ServiceNow (NOW) and Workday (WDAY). Figure 5: GitLab’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios GTLB DCF Implied NOPAT Each of the above scenarios assumes GitLab grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, GitLab’s invested capital grew 23% compounded annually from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025. If I assume GitLab’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if GitLab is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company has $45 million in minority interests, <$1 million in deferred tax liabilities, $140 million in outstanding employee stock options, and no excess cash. GitLab has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of -$5/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: More Recessionary Fears But The Technical Outlook Gets Stronger

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. American recession and USA economy contraction cycle as a US decline The quite rare Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) last week has been supported by the early action this week which adds further weight to the bullish case. This is quite interesting in light of the major earnings out this week from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close today. They will be followed on Thursday by earnings from Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Performance Table All of these four stocks have performed quite well over the past 5 days led by a double-digit gain for META up 10.83%. There are solid gains for the other stocks with 8.2% for AMZN, MSFT + 7.4%, and AAPL up 5.7%. During the same period, the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 5.16%. RS MSFT, META, AAPL, AMZN These six-month charts all show the steady declines from early in the year. The declining 20-day MAs (blue) for all are below their 50-day MA (in red) despite the recent sharp gains. Below the candle charts is plotted the relative performance (RS) which reflects the ratio of the stock price to the S&P 500. All except MSFT are lower than the SPX over the past month except MSFT as it is up just over 4%. Over the past three months, all four stocks have been weaker than the SPX which is down 7.92%. The worst performer has been AMZN which is down 20.96%. On the charts above only the RS pattern for MSFT shows signs of a bottom as it has formed higher lows, line b. A move in the RS for MSFT above the downtrend, line a, would be a positive development. The lower lows in the RS for the other three stocks and the sharply declining MAs suggest it is too early for a sustainable bottom. Spyder Trust With A/D Lines As for the overall market, the Spyder Trust (SPY) is up 0.7% this week and is well above the tentative May pivot at $534.51. The declining 50-day MA is at $559 and the 100-day at $577.85. The 20-day EMA has turned up slightly at $541.49 and represents good support. More importantly, the S&P 500 A/D line has now moved above the major resistance at line a. This indicates that the decline from the late 2024 highs is over. A retest of the breakout level is always possible, especially with the key earnings and monthly jobs report this week. The NYSE Stocks Only A/D line is still below its downtrend, line b, but is well above its EMA which is now rising. The NYSE All A/D line closed at its downtrend, line c, as the short-term resistance at line d, was broken last week. The Nasdaq 100 A/D (not shown) has also completed its correction and the relative performance indicates that QQQ is starting to lead the SPY. Based on the data through Tuesday’s close, all the weekly A/D lines should close positive this week. These developments further support buying on market corrections.

Title: If the U.S. Avoids a Recession, the Mag 7 Will Win Big—and How to Trade While Waiting for Confirmati (Serhii Bondarenko)

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the S&P 500 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges.
