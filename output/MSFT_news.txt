A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Title: Reviewing my 2024 Predictions

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024. The rule is that if it doesn’t happen by December 15th, it doesn’t count. (And I had one come to pass on Friday, just two days ahead of the deadline. Go me.) How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Will Sticky Inflation Stop The Fed Rate Cut?

Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates. Fed Rate Cuts Expected Stocks finally saw a down week after the S&P 500 hit all-time highs the previous week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), continued to move higher. The returns on the Magnificent 7 and bank stocks have been stellar since the U.S. Presidential election. Tesla (TSLA) has stood out since the election, rising almost 74%! Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again. Stocks are in the midst of the most favorable time of the year, so the seasonals add some comfort that last week’s decline shouldn’t prove to be the start of a significant decline. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, corporate bitcoin adopters include the crypto firm Marathon Holdings and Japan's Metaplanet. Biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals also recently announced the approval by its boar for a $1 million purchase. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, the move is generally rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. That could be changing, though, industry sources told Business Insider. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told BI. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."
