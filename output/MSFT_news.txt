To say it’s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff announcements.

The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher “reciprocal” tariffs for the U.S.’s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect—causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days—except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon’s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here’s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple’s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker’s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump’s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump’s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president’s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon’s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump’s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn’t completely reliant on e-commerce—its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company’s profits and won’t be as impacted by the administration’s levies as Amazon’s physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

Title: Is NVDA Stock A Bargain At $110?

More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.
