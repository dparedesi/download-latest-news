Constellation Energy (CEG) has received positive analysts' reports after the power utility's announcement last Friday it would be restarting Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide electricity for Microsoft's (MSFT) data centers. Barclays analyst Nicholas Campanella wrote in a note to clients that the move was "somewhat unexpected by the market," and that Barclays sees it "as positive" for the company, as well as for Talen Energy Group (TLN) and Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG). Campanella has an "overweight" rating on Constellation, with a price target of $211. KeyBanc analysts said Constellation's deal with Microsoft "suggests attractive economics" and they expect "positive momentum to continue." The called it "an important catalyst in demonstrating the value of nuclear generation" in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). KeyBanc has an "overweight" rating on the stock as well, and it also raised the price target to $265 from $230. The news on Friday sent Constellation Energy shares skyrocketing 22% to an all-time high. Although they are little changed in early afternoon trading Monday, they have gained about 120% year-to-date.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on the final day of a trading week that saw the financial headlines dominated by the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. A day after notching an all-time closing high in the wake of the Fed's decision to lower interest rates, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on Friday. After wavering for much of the session, the Dow rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of less than 0.1%, eking out its second straight record close. The Nasdaq ended Friday's session 0.4% lower. FedEx (FDX) shares plummeted 15.2%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock, after the package delivery giant reported lower-than-expected quarterly results and trimmed its full-year forecasts. The company cited soft demand trends, especially in U.S. markets. Following the earnings release, analysts at the investment bank Jefferies reduced their price target on FedEx stock. Lennar (LEN) topped sales and profit estimates with its fiscal third-quarter results, but shares of the homebuilder fell 5.4% after it predicted its gross margin on home sales would remain flat quarter-over-quarter. Friday's downdraft reversed the gains posted by Lennar stock in the previous session following the Fed's rate-cut announcement. Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) also gave back the gains they notched after the Fed's decision, dropping 5.2% on Friday. The less-than-truckload (LTL) freight company is navigating numerous headwinds, with shipment volumes and rates coming under pressure amid soft freight demand, increasing capital expenditures and a shortage of drivers. Electric utility Constellation Energy (CEG) announced plans to restart operations at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant to provide environmentally friendly energy for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. Constellation said it inked a 20-year deal with the software giant to create the Crane Clean Energy Center, generating carbon-free electricity to power Microsoft's data centers on the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland power transmission system. Constellation Energy shares soared 22.3% on Friday, notching the top performance in the S&P 500. Constellation's announcement also helped lift shares of other electricity generators, including those of power utility Vistra (VST), which jumped 16.6%. Vistra also announced it will acquire the remaining 15% stake that it does not currently own in its subsidiary Vistra Vision, which includes nuclear, solar, and energy storage assets. Meanwhile, shares of fellow Texas-based power generator NRG Energy (NRG) added 6.4%. Shares of CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) gained 8.1% following positive comments from analysts at Citigroup. The cybersecurity firm drew negative attention in July when a faulty update of its security software caused widespread technology outages worldwide. However, analysts applauded transparency from the company's management team following the incident. Citi also pointed to CrowdStrike's success in limiting customer churn and maintaining pricing.

Title: BCE is Dead to Me – August Dividend Income Report

The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / September 19, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. This month, I couldn’t help discussing BCE. Let’s start with the numbers as of September 5th 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – August 2024): 150.27% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 83 months): 14.18% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 13.62% (total return 141.80%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 9.27% (total return 84.60%) I’m sorry for the strong title. I had to make it crystal clear and get your attention: I’ve never been a fan of BCE, which I always saw as a deluxe bond: a stock that pays a good yield with a good dividend growth policy, but where I don’t expect much stock price appreciation over time. That’s how BCE compares advantageously to a bond: capital stability with better income growth expectations. So, what do we do when the capital isn’t that stable and the dividend growth policy is reduced from 5% to 3%? We do a deep dive into the financials. I’m often asked by members to bring you all with me on this journey into financial statements. In general, I don’t read financial statements from cover to cover. I only do a deep dive when I have questions that don’t have self evident answers. I’m doing this analysis of BCE to find out what will happen with the dividend in 2025. I have summarized my thoughts in the video below, but strongly encourage you to read the complete article. So, let’s start the journey with the elephant in the room… Telcos are capital-intensive. It means they must spend considerable amounts of money to maintain and improve their networks. They will go through periods where they borrow more money than they generate because those investments will generate profit in the future. That’s like obtaining a large mortgage in your 20s with the anticipation that you will increase your salary over time. You take the loan now, and you bank on your ability to generate stronger cash flow in the future. Let’s take a look at what the long-term debt looks like in BCE’s 2023 annual statement first: This chart tells us two things. What the chart doesn’t tell us is what is going on this year so far (we have 2 more quarters to know where this story is going). Let’s take a look at the most recent numbers. I’ll start by looking at the total long-term debt trend for the past 10 years to see where we were, and where we are going. As you can see, we are not going in the right direction. Since 2017, BCE has been on a streak of securing more and more debt. As I’ve discussed this topic before, the point was to obtain inexpensive debt and invest massively in BCE’s network. The good old adage of “you need to spend money to make money”. That’s true… until it isn’t. It all depends on the cost of your debt and the quality of your investments. We will initially focus on the cost of the debt, and we will discuss the results of those investments (cash flow generation) later on. I’ve pulled the latest quarterly update for BCE’s debt. My focus on the next chart is how much of that debt will come to maturity in the next 12 months. It is true that interest rates are a bit lower now than they were 6 months ago. However, Moody’s (a credit rating agency) recently downgraded BCE to one notch above the level of junk bonds (to Baa3 from Baa2). This will not help BCE secure better borrowing rates in the coming months. I’d like to draw your attention to the amount of debt up for renewal in the next 12 months (between June 30th 2024 and June 30th 2025). That’s 17% of BCE’s debt that will cost more than it was before. Speaking of interest charges, it’s also out of control. From its latest quarterly earnings report, BCE shows interest expense up by 19% Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 and up 20% ytd 2024 vs ytd 2023. So, over the past 12 months, the interest expenses increased by roughly 20%. I was curious to know which portion of the debt was up to renewal between June 30th 2023 and June 30th 2024 to have generated this 20% increase. That was $6B, and in the next 12 months (we will see another $6.5B up for renewal). With $6B up for renewal in the past 12 months, how much have interest expenses increased? Assuming interest expense increases by about 20% again in 2024, we should see a total interest expense of nearly $2B (1.937B) in the next 12 months. This is a little bit more than $300M in free cash flow the company must generate to cover the debt without borrowing more. Speaking of cash flow…. So far, we have seen debt going up steadily since 2017. We have now seen how quickly interest expenses are rising and we can expect anything between $200M to $300M more in interest expenses in the next 12 months vs. what BCE paid over the past 12 months. The whole point of borrowing so much money was to invest in BCE’s business and generate more cash flow. Let’s take a look at what has been happening with cash from operations and free cash flow: Again, since 2020, we have seen no growth in cash flow from operations or free cash flow. That could be explained by a serious lack of growth from BCE over the past five years. The next graph shows that this is an industry problem, as Telus and Rogers also struggled to generate revenue growth over the past five years. The big jump for those two companies is related to acquisitions. The Big Three have invested massively but haven’t been able to generate organic growth to match those investments. With higher interest rates, this becomes a serious problem. We now have a terrible combination of rising debt, rising interest expenses and struggling cash flow growth. The main reason why most people want BCE in their portfolio is the dividend. Unfortunately, many investors are blinded by the yield and the company’s reputation and think things won’t change. If BCE has been able to systematically increase its dividend for over a decade, there is no way the company will stop. Wrong. To be clear, I’m not saying BCE will cut its dividend, but I’m saying it’s wrong to think that a company will be there for you forever. Back to the dividend, and is it safe? Let’s take a look at the numbers. These graphs show the dividend payment (top graph)) and the free cash flow (bottom graph). Since 2021, BCE hasn’t generated enough free cash flow to cover its dividend. Therefore, to cover business expenses, capital expenditure and dividends, the company had no choice but to issue more debt. We have seen the debt increase and the results on interest expenses earlier. While this is a valid strategy where a company must sometimes use leverage to grow, it’s important to note it’s not a sustainable strategy over the long haul. After all, you can’t systematically borrow money to pay for traveling and car expenses. Sooner or later, you will have to spend less than you earn and pay down that debt. Let’s take a deeper look at the free cash flow per share vs. the dividend per share. This graph clearly shows that dividend payments have exceeded free cash flow since 2021. Considering the amount of new debt and the rising cost of interest, it’s fair to say that BCE will likely borrow more money in 2025 to cover its expenses if nothing changes. BCE can’t continue borrowing money and distributing dividends like candies on Halloween. If I was CEO, I would seriously think of chopping this useless payment in my income statement called dividends to pay off debts and provides BCE with additional “financial flexibility”. I don’t think BCE is there yet, and we have more chances to see a pause in the dividend growth in 2025. That would be the minimum the business could do to get out of this rut and get back on track. BCE has created a situation where if it hits another road bump (such as a recession), it won’t be able to maintain its promises. The portfolio is slowly taking shape with 11 companies spread across 7 sectors. My goal is to build a portfolio generating 4-5% in yield across 15 positions. I will continue to add new stock monthly until I reach that goal. My current yield is 4.68%. Two months ago, I made a “larger play” into CWB.TO by purchasing about $1,500 worth of shares. I used my regular $500 per month plus $1,000 from the margin account to make that purchase. This month, I’m not doing a new buy and simply reimbursing a portion of the margin account to bring it down to $0. I’m using the margin account when I see a good opportunity and I want to bolster my positions quickly. Once again, keep in mind that it’s not a significant amount compared to all my assets and that’s why I’m “playing” with this money. Here’s my SM portfolio as of September 5th, 2024 (before the bell): Let’s look at my CDN portfolio. Numbers are as of September 5th, 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$1,084.74 (+1%) since August’s income report. Alimentation Couche-Tard disappoints again ATD reported a mixed quarter as revenue jumped by 17%, but EPS declined by 4%. The decrease in EPS was largely driven by softer traffic and fuel demand along with reduced fuel margins in the U.S. markets. However, the company maintained healthy margins on its merchandise which partially mitigated the impact of lower fuel profitability. Same-store sales were also down across all segments (-1.1% in US, -2.1% in Europe and 3.9% in Canada). ATD hasn’t spoken about its offer to acquire Seven & i, but we know 7Eleven wants a higher price for its assets. We know ATD to be disciplined so they may increase their offer, but ATD will surely not overpay. I discussed the situation on The Moose on the Loose podcast episode below. CCL Industries thrives on strong organic growth CCL Industries reported a record quarter with revenue up 12% and EPS up 26%. This growth was driven by 8.5% organic sales growth, a 3% contribution from acquisitions, and 0.7% from currency translation. Sales per segment were CCL +14.5%, 4.6% from acquisitions, and mid-single digit organic sales growth in Europe and North America and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Avery was up 3.3% (mix of organic and acquisition), while Checkpoint was up 16.1% on 17.5% organic growth. Innovia was up 8.3% with 6.2% of that being organic growth. CCL expects the operating performance of its segments, particularly in RFID and Direct-to-Consumer badging at Avery, to continue driving growth. Granite REIT is “business as usual” Granite REIT reported another good quarter with revenue up 8% and AFFO per share up 7%. The payout ratio for the quarter was 70% (vs 73% last year) and 69% for the first 6 months (vs 71%). NOI was $116.8 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $108.6 million in the prior year period. That was an increase of $8.2 million primarily as a result of the completion of a development property in Brantford, Canada in the first quarter of 2024, contractual rent adjustments and consumer price index-based increases and renewal leasing activity. National Bank is a rockstar It feels like National Bank is playing in another league these days. The bank reported EPS up 24%, driven by strong performance across all segments. P&C was up 15%, driven by growth in loan and deposit volumes while PCLs were up only $4M vs. last year. Wealth management was up 19% driven by growth in fee-based revenues and net interest income. Financial markets were up 55%, driven by growth in global markets revenue and in corporate and investment banking revenues. U.S. Specialty & Intl. was also up 23% driven by a strong performance of both Credigy and ABA Bank. NA also expects to close the acquisition of CWB by the end of 2025. Royal Bank is robust Royal Bank reported a robust quarter with revenue up 13% and EPS up 15%. Personal & commercial banking was up 17%, driven by HSBC assets acquisition. Excluding HSBC Canada results, net income was up 7%. Wealth management was up 30% driven by higher fee-based client assets reflecting market appreciation and net sales. Insurance was down 21% largely due to lower insurance investment. Capital markets were up 23%, primarily due to higher municipal banking activity, higher loan syndication activity in the U.S., higher debt origination in North America and favorable USD conversion factors. You can watch my complete Canadian Banks most recent Quarterly Review here: Stella Jones sells more utility poles and railway ties Stella-Jones reported another solid quarter with revenue up 8% and EPS up 13%. This growth was driven by a strong performance in its infrastructure-related businesses, particularly in the utility poles and railway tie segments which saw organic sales growth of 10%. The utility pole segment benefited from increasing demand for pole replacement programs in both the U.S. and Canada, while railway ties growth was driven by higher pricing and steady demand from Class 1 railroads. Sales in the residential lumber segment saw a slight decline due to lower demand and a softening in lumber prices. Here’s my US portfolio now. Numbers are as of September 5th, 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$3,969.13 (+3.4%) since August’s income report. Brookfield Corp break $1T in assets under management! Brookfield continues to perform well this year with higher distributable earnings per share (+11% before selling assets, +80% after selling assets this quarter). The company raised $68 billion in the second quarter bringing total assets under management to approximately $1 trillion. Cash and liquid assets increased to $62 billion while deployable capital reached $150 billion. Brookfield completed $800 million of share buybacks in 2024. The company is focusing on growing its insurance and credit capabilities, which are expected to be a strong driver of future earnings growth. Home Depot faces headwinds Home Depot did better than expected despite mediocre growth (revenue +0.6%, and EPS +0.4%). Revenue includes approximately $1.3B in contributions from its recent acquisition of SRS Distribution. However, comparable sales fell by 3.3%, reflecting ongoing challenges in consumer demand due to higher interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite declining comparable sales, Home Depot met its earnings expectations, benefiting from disciplined cost management and efficiency improvements. Management expects more headwinds for the rest of the year, with comparable sales down 3 to 4% in 2024 and EPS down 2% to 4%. Each quarter we run an exclusive report for Dividend Stocks Rock (DSR) members who subscribe to our very special additional service called DSR PRO. The PRO report includes a summary of each company’s earnings report for the period. We have been doing this for an entire year now and I wanted to share my own DSR PRO report for this portfolio. You can download the full PDF showing all the information about all my holdings. Results have been updated as of June 30th, 2024. Download my portfolio Q1 2024 report. All companies in my portfolio have increased their dividends over the past 12 months, resulting in an almost double-digit increase this month. So far this year, I’m on pace to show 8% dividend growth across my portfolio. Dividend growth (over the past 12 months): Canadian Holding payouts: $260.60 CAD. U.S. Holding payouts: $144.58 USD. Total payouts: $456.07 CAD. *I used a USD/CAD conversion rate of 1.352 Since I started this portfolio in September 2017, I have received a total of $27,210.71 CAD in dividends. Keep in mind that this is a “pure dividend growth portfolio” as no capital can be added to this account other than retained and/or reinvested dividends. Therefore, all dividend growth is coming from the stocks and not from any additional capital being added to the account. You probably noticed I moved above $1,000 in cash across my US and Canadian accounts. This liquidity will soon be used to increase my position in Toromont Industries (TIH.TO) since it’s my smallest holding. I don’t expect to do any other trades by the end of the year unless one of my top holdings breaks the 10% barrier of all my portfolios (hello, Apple!). Cheers, Mike.
