U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7—the day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 25:The Microsoft Copilot app is displayed on a smartphone on April 25, 2025 ... More in Berlin, Germany. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock has declined approximately 7% this year, primarily due to investor concerns about potential tariff impacts. However, this concern appears largely overblown as Microsoft’s business model centers around Azure cloud services and software rather than hardware, making it substantially less vulnerable to tariff-related disruptions than hardware-focused tech companies. Separately, for another strong tech name, see Should You Buy GOOG Stock After A Q1 Beat? Looking beyond short-term fluctuations reveals an impressive trajectory: Microsoft's stock has gained approximately 65% since early 2023, driven by: Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% revenue increase, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $262 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Despite a slight margin contraction (from 36.7% to 35.4%) due to increased AI and R&D investments, Microsoft maintains an exceptionally healthy 35% net margin. The company's EPS has increased 29% from $9.65 in 2022 to $12.41 in the trailing twelve months. Microsoft has demonstrated remarkable resilience during market downturns: Microsoft has positioned itself as essential infrastructure for the AI revolution. Similar to how Nvidia provides the GPU processing power, Microsoft delivers the computing resources, data storage, and networking capabilities that underpin AI development across numerous companies, including OpenAI. This allows investors exposure to the broader AI growth story without needing to predict which specific AI application will ultimately dominate. Microsoft represents a compelling investment opportunity despite near-term volatility. Its cloud-first business model shields it from significant tariff impacts, while its position as fundamental infrastructure for the AI revolution provides substantial long-term growth potential with less risk than pure-play AI companies. Currently trading around $390, Microsoft's stock has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31x. Although this is higher than the 24x P/E ratio observed in 2022, it is still below the stock's four-year average P/E of 35x, suggesting potential for further appreciation. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception.
