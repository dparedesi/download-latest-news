The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / September 19, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. This month, I couldn’t help discussing BCE. Let’s start with the numbers as of September 5th 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – August 2024): 150.27% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 83 months): 14.18% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 13.62% (total return 141.80%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 9.27% (total return 84.60%) I’m sorry for the strong title. I had to make it crystal clear and get your attention: I’ve never been a fan of BCE, which I always saw as a deluxe bond: a stock that pays a good yield with a good dividend growth policy, but where I don’t expect much stock price appreciation over time. That’s how BCE compares advantageously to a bond: capital stability with better income growth expectations. So, what do we do when the capital isn’t that stable and the dividend growth policy is reduced from 5% to 3%? We do a deep dive into the financials. I’m often asked by members to bring you all with me on this journey into financial statements. In general, I don’t read financial statements from cover to cover. I only do a deep dive when I have questions that don’t have self evident answers. I’m doing this analysis of BCE to find out what will happen with the dividend in 2025. I have summarized my thoughts in the video below, but strongly encourage you to read the complete article. So, let’s start the journey with the elephant in the room… Telcos are capital-intensive. It means they must spend considerable amounts of money to maintain and improve their networks. They will go through periods where they borrow more money than they generate because those investments will generate profit in the future. That’s like obtaining a large mortgage in your 20s with the anticipation that you will increase your salary over time. You take the loan now, and you bank on your ability to generate stronger cash flow in the future. Let’s take a look at what the long-term debt looks like in BCE’s 2023 annual statement first: This chart tells us two things. What the chart doesn’t tell us is what is going on this year so far (we have 2 more quarters to know where this story is going). Let’s take a look at the most recent numbers. I’ll start by looking at the total long-term debt trend for the past 10 years to see where we were, and where we are going. As you can see, we are not going in the right direction. Since 2017, BCE has been on a streak of securing more and more debt. As I’ve discussed this topic before, the point was to obtain inexpensive debt and invest massively in BCE’s network. The good old adage of “you need to spend money to make money”. That’s true… until it isn’t. It all depends on the cost of your debt and the quality of your investments. We will initially focus on the cost of the debt, and we will discuss the results of those investments (cash flow generation) later on. I’ve pulled the latest quarterly update for BCE’s debt. My focus on the next chart is how much of that debt will come to maturity in the next 12 months. It is true that interest rates are a bit lower now than they were 6 months ago. However, Moody’s (a credit rating agency) recently downgraded BCE to one notch above the level of junk bonds (to Baa3 from Baa2). This will not help BCE secure better borrowing rates in the coming months. I’d like to draw your attention to the amount of debt up for renewal in the next 12 months (between June 30th 2024 and June 30th 2025). That’s 17% of BCE’s debt that will cost more than it was before. Speaking of interest charges, it’s also out of control. From its latest quarterly earnings report, BCE shows interest expense up by 19% Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023 and up 20% ytd 2024 vs ytd 2023. So, over the past 12 months, the interest expenses increased by roughly 20%. I was curious to know which portio... (truncated)

Title: Oracle’s Larry Ellison Is Now the World’s 3rd Richest Person Thanks to the A.I. Boom

Time Published: 2024-09-18T17:12:40Z

Larry Ellison, the founder and chairman of software giant Oracle, is the latest tech entrepreneur to reap the rewards of the A.I. boom. The billionaire is currently the world’s third wealthiest person and briefly surpassed Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos as the second richest person this week (behind Elon Musk). A recent Oracle stock surge has sent Ellison’s net worth soaring to an estimated $203.5 billion. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Fueling Ellison’s good fortune is an unprecedented demand for data centers, which power the A.I. models underpinning products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Oracle beat Wall Street’s expectations earlier this month when it reported a 7 percent year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $13.3 billion, with the company’s cloud services revenue skyrocketing by 21 percent to $5.6 billion. The news has been a booster for Oracle’s share price, which has soared more than 47 percent in the past 12 months and almost doubled since the beginning of 2023. Oracle currently has 162 data centers in operation and under construction globally, Ellison told analysts during a recent earnings call, adding that he expects the company to eventually have 1,000 to 2,000 of these facilities. The company’s largest data center is 800 megawatts and will contain “acres” of Nvidia (NVDA)’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train A.I. models, he said. Nvidia’s GPUs have been in high demand as Big Tech races to deploy A.I. products. During an Oracle financial analyst meeting on Sept. 12, Ellison described a dinner with Elon Musk and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, where the Oracle head and Musk were “begging” Jensen for more A.I. chips. “Please take our money. No, take more of it. You’re not taking enough, we need you to take more of it,” recalled Ellison, who said the strategy worked. Oracle also recently bolstered its database power by partnering up with Amazon’s cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The deal, which will allow customers to access Oracle’s database offerings within AWS, follows a slew of similar cloud partnerships the company has struck with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). “We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” said Ellison during the earnings call. Ellison, 80, co-founded Oracle in 1977 and helmed the company as CEO until 2014. He also recently made headlines for his financial backing of the acquisition of Paramount (PARA) by Skydance, a media company founded by his son David Ellison. He reportedly is set to have an influential role in the takeover as a major shareholder. But for the time being, the billionaire appears to be firmly stationed on A.I.—and he has grand ambitions for the new technology. In addition to generative A.I.’s potential to help spot forest fires and identify agricultural output needs via drones, he lauded the ability of A.I.-enabled cameras to enhance surveillance while speaking at Oracle’s financial analyst meeting. “Citizens will be on their best behavior because we’re constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on,” he noted. Police officers, meanwhile, will be supervised at all times, with body cameras prepared to alert the appropriate authorities of any misconduct. “The world is going to be a better place as we exploit these opportunities and take advantage of this great technology,” he added. But who will take advantage first remains up in the air. “There’s really one winner. Someone’s going to be better at this than anyone else, and multiple people are trying,” said Ellison of the A.I. boom, likening the technology arms race to “Formula 1.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: The 3 Best Big Closed-End Funds Of 2024

Businessman analyzes the graph of trend market growth in 2024 Sometimes as income investors we face a situation that sounds like a good problem to have: We have to pick among a group of very impressive investments! That’s obviously much tougher than, say, picking between a stock or fund with a winning record and another with a losing one. But when you think about the investment choices you’ve made over the years, I think you’ll find that picking between options that seem equally good is actually what you’ve had to do most of the time. To get into how to make a call when you face this situation, we’re going to use my favorite high-income plays: closed-end funds (CEFs), which routinely yield 8%+. That way I can show you what I do to come to that perfect (or as close to perfect as possible!) mix of high, safe dividends, potential upside and overall investment quality. On the surface, the three funds we’ll look at below will all look great to many income investors. Here’s why: Granted, these features all sound perfect, so you could be forgiven if your first instinct is to just buy all three of these funds. But if we dig into the details, we find that there is, in fact, a clear winner here. Our three CEFs boast the strongest performance in the space this year. They are: the Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund (KYN), Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Diversified Equity Fund (ETY) and General American Investors Co. (GAM). As you can see below, they’ve absolutely soared since January 1: 3 CEFs Soar 2024 And when we dig into their stats, we see they have what it takes to back up that run: 3 CEFs As you can see, each fund offers a big yield and a steep discount (except ETY, though its 3.8% discount is still pretty respectable). And look at the “yield on NAV” column. That’s the yield as calculated on the fund’s NAV, not the discounted market price. That’s part of the magic of CEFs: The yield on NAV is lower than the yield on market price (or the yield we get, in other words), making the payout easier for management to cover. All right, this all sounds good so far. But we’re no closer to making our choice. Well, maybe we are, actually, because if we zoom out to the past decade, we see that one fund of these three is a clear winner on the performance side of things. KYN Lags While ETY and GAM have posted strong total returns, up 184% and 166%, respectively, KYN is down a lot. So despite the strong return KYN posted this year, this fund is not a long-term hold. That makes sense: KYN holds oil and energy-related infrastructure firms, and energy is a cyclical industry that rises and falls with volatile oil and gas prices. So KYN makes sense if you’re bullish on oil, which was a good place to be at the start of 2024, with oil rising throughout the year, defying expectations. But the trick with this fund is that you’ll need to sell (and likely quickly) when expectations for oil get too hot. That makes KYN a good short-term play that gets you a nice 8.2% dividend yield as you wait for oil to reach the price you expect it to get to. At my CEF Insider service, however, we focus on holding funds for the long term, so we can collect their income over years instead of weeks or months. And that’s why ETY and GAM, despite the former’s smaller discount and the latter’s smaller yield, make more sense for us. So we’re down to two funds. But which is worth buying now? Again, going by a quick glance, GAM’s bigger discount makes it look more appealing. But look at this chart: GAM Big Discount We see that GAM’s 14.9% discount (the orange line) is actually smaller than the 16.3% it’s averaged over the last decade, so it isn’t as much of a deal as it appears to be. In fact, GAM could see price declines as its discount reverts to the average. What’s more, as you can see in the purple line above, ETY trades at premiums every so often, making its relatively humble 3.8% discount look better. That’s especially true since ETY has slightly outperformed GAM over the last decade, with that 184% to 166% total return we saw earlier. Plus, ETY yields more! With an 8.4% yield on market price, it’s actually the most generous of these three funds. However, there is one thing we need to keep in mind: ETY invests in a lot of household-name large-cap stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Walmart (WMT), then writes call options on those stocks to generate income it uses to help fund its payout. That strategy does tend to slow overall returns, as a fund’s best performers get sold or “called away.” But management has successfully navigated that, throttling its call-option sales in a timely way to minimize that drag. The result: that 184% total return over the last decade—and that superior 8.4% dividend, too. Taken together, ETY has a well-rounded collection of strengths that put it above GAM and KYN. And there are plenty of other CEFs out there that do, too, paying outsized dividends—the average yield across CEFs is 8.2%—and even paying us every month inst... (truncated)

Title: Watch These Microsoft Stock Price Levels Amid Recent Bullish Momentum

Microsoft (MSFT) shares logged their seventh consecutive higher close on Tuesday, with the latest gains coming after the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% and approved a $60 billion stock buyback. Bullish sentiment may carry into Wednesday after the tech giant and the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, announced plans late Tuesday to launch a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure fund to build data centers and energy projects aimed at meeting the growing demands for the technology’s computing power. The fund, which will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing, includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment company MGX as a partner, while AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) plans to contribute expertise. Below, we’ll take a closer look at Microsoft’s chart and turn to technical analysis to identify important price levels to watch out for. Since bottoming just below the closely watched 200-day moving average (MA) in early August, Microsoft shares traded mostly sideways before resuming another move higher earlier this month. However, it’s worth noting the stock’s recent advance has occurred on declining trading volume, indicating a lack of participation from larger market participants. Moreover, the price may potentially be carving out a head and shoulders top, a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. Microsoft shares gained 0.9% on Tuesday to close at $435.15. Looking ahead, it’s worth keeping an eye on four key price levels that investors will likely be watching. If the shares continue rising, they could initially meet overhead resistance around $448, where traders who bought earlier this month may look for exit points near a trendline that connects a period of narrow consolidation in June with a minor countertrend peak in July. A move above this level could see the shares retest the $468 area, where they would likely encounter selling pressure around their all-time high (ATH) set in early July. A breakout though this area would invalidate a head and shoulders formation. Amid share price weakness, investors should keep a close eye on the $410 area, a location on the chart just below the rising 200-day MA where the price finds support from a horizontal line linking a series of comparable trading levels from late January through to this month. Ongoing selling could trigger a decline to around $385, a region where bulls may look for buying opportunities near the November swing high and August swing low. A breakdown below this levels would confirm a head and shoulders formation on Microsoft’s chart. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
