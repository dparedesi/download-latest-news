Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Qualcomm (QCOM) came to CES 2025 on a mission to stake its claim as a major player in the PC market, and it proved it’s on its way with the release of its latest Snapdragon X chip. Available in mid-range laptops priced at roughly $600, the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run on-device AI applications and features without having to break the bank. But the company isn’t content with simply taking on the likes of AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) in the laptop space. It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers. And during an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months. “We want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot+ PC,” Amon said outside Qualcomm’s booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas. “We're not stopping here. We're just starting with [that] portfolio of products.” In particular, Amon said, Qualcomm is looking to expand into the high-performance PC graphics market, something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA). Qualcomm isn’t new to the PC space. The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops, but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps. But things are different this time around. Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive, with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and long-lasting batteries that you don’t find on AMD or Intel-powered systems. Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft (MSFT) to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intel’s chips can run on Qualcomm’s. So far, the companies are doing well enough at the task. In my own testing, Microsoft’s Snapdragon-powered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didn’t suffer from any app compatibility issues. Gaming, however, is a different story. Gamers require serious processing and graphics power, and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip, gamers, especially desktop gamers, will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles. It’s unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space; Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors. If it is looking to get into the dedicated graphics space, however, it would mean having to tangle with Nvidia, which controls a staggering 88% of the desktop graphics space alone, according to Tom’s Hardware. If taking on Nvidia isn’t enough, Qualcomm’s entire PC effort relies on stealing share from AMD and Intel, and that’s a tall task. According to Mercury Research, via Tom’s Hardware, Intel still controls some 76% of the PC market, but the company’s recent struggles related to its massive turnaround effort, including the ouster of CEO Pat Gelsinger, give Qualcomm an opportunity to take market share from the chip behemoth. AMD isn’t resting on its laurels either. The company is similarly looking to capture greater market share from its archrival and is doing so by leaning heavily on AI PCs and gaming. For his part, Amon said Qualcomm’s growth has little to do with its competitor’s struggles and everything to do with its own efforts. “The incredible traction you're seeing right now is just because we develop a very competitive platform …independent of what our competitors were doing,” Amon said. “We're just starting. We’ll continue to have a roadmap of products and we will be pushing the boundaries of performance and battery life at every generation,” he added. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Stocks are priced for 'perfection' and more vulnerable to a correction, Goldman warns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now. Read more: TD Ameritrade's former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters, Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025. Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.
