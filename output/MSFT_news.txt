ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft's stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has climbed over 30% in the past six months, driven by strong quarterly results marked by improving revenue growth and expanding margins. However, with the stock now trading at 37 times its trailing earnings, the key question for investors is whether MSFT is still worth buying. We believe MSFT stock currently looks expensive due to its elevated valuation. Our view is based on a detailed analysis comparing the stock’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and its overall financial position, both current and historical. While Microsoft shows strong operational and financial performance, these strengths already seem priced into its lofty valuation, as outlined below. That said, if you’re looking for upside potential with lower volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering returns of over 91% since inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Set To Surge 30%? Let’s explore the key factors we assessed. This table shows how MSFT’s valuation compares with the broader market.

For more details, see: MSFT Operating Income Comparison MSFT has shown slightly better resilience than the S&P 500 during major downturns, based on both (a) the depth of the drop and (b) the speed of recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock While Microsoft has excelled across financial and operational metrics, its current 37x earnings multiple is higher than other tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta (see how Microsoft’s valuation compares). While Azure’s growth could convince some investors that an even higher multiple is justified, we think from a risk standpoint it’s better to wait for a price pullback before buying MSFT. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has a consistent track record of outperforming its benchmark, which includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with lower risk versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nebius Stock: Next AWS In The Making?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shares of Nebius Group stock (NASDAQ: NBIS) increased by over 45% in after-hours trading on Monday following the company’s announcement of a significant deal to supply Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with GPU infrastructure capacity valued at $17.4 billion over a five-year span. Different from conventional hyperscalers like Amazon’s AWS or Microsoft’s Azure, which provide a wide array of general-purpose cloud services, Nebius falls into a new category referred to as “Neoclouds” – specifically targeting high-performance infrastructure tailored for AI tasks. The firm delivers computing, storage, managed services, and tools aimed at developing, fine-tuning, and executing AI models. So what implications does this deal hold for Nebius, and does it enhance the attractiveness of the stock? This agreement is transformative for Nebius. In an SEC filing, the company stated that GPU services will be implemented in several tranches, with an overall contract total of $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft also holds the option to acquire an extra $2 billion in services. Over the five-year period, this translates to revenues exceeding $3.5 billion annually – a significant increase compared to Nebius’s anticipated revenues of only $570 million for 2025. Microsoft has increasingly relied on third-party solutions to tackle a deficit in cloud infrastructure aimed at AI workloads. The software giant has frequently encountered shortfalls in the AI compute capacity required for both its internal AI product development and the sale of Azure-branded AI services. Additionally, Microsoft is dedicated to providing computing resources to its AI partner OpenAI, which further strains its capacity. To satisfy this demand, Nebius will supply Microsoft with dedicated capacity from a new data center located in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. The company also revealed that it is assessing financing options to expedite growth, with capital expenditures for this deal supported by cash flow generated from the contract and debt secured against it. However attractive it may be, investing in a single stock comes with high risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio has been designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. With the demand for generative AI remaining strong, even though there are other specialized competitors in the field, Nebius distinguishes itself for several reasons. First, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which produces the most advanced chips and effectively sets industry standards. Nvidia acts as both a key partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and owning over 1 million shares of the company. This connection might afford Nebius prioritized access to Nvidia's highly coveted GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, in comparison to other cloud service providers. This could represent a significant edge in a GPU market constrained by supply, where demand significantly surpasses availability, especially for cutting-edge chips. Another aspect that differentiates Nebius is its vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, eliminating the need for OEMs and engaging directly with manufacturers to reduce costs, optimize performance more effectively, and swiftly incorporate the latest GPUs. This degree of control not only lessens supply chain dependencies but also accelerates deployment cycles. This is crucial for keeping pace with rapid AI lifecycles and also provides the company with an advantage in terms of performance-per-watt compared to its competitors. Is Nebius stock a wise purchase at the current price of around $95 per share? The stock trades at roughly 40 times consensus FY’25 revenue. In comparison, larger competitor CoreWeave trades at about 10 times FY’25 revenue. However, several justifiable reasons exist for the higher valuation. To begin with, Nebius' growth prospects are strong. According to consensus estimates, Nebius's sales are expected to grow by 160% next year, outpacing CoreWeave, and this figure could be notably higher when considering the MSFT deal. Furthermore, Nebius's technological advantages, such as its proprietary technology stack, may aid in setting it apart from its rivals. By managing both hardware and software, Nebius is able to fine-tune performance for specific AI workloads, giving it a long-term competitive advantage. Nebius additionally possesses a solid balance sheet. As of the end of the most recent quarter, NBIS debt stood at $1.2 billion, leading to a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 5%. The cash for NBIS (including cash equivalents) accounts for $1.7 billion of a total of $5.1 billion in assets, resulting in a Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 32.9%. This should enable Nebius to continue expanding its global presence with lower financial risk. This could lead to significant interest expenses and potentially hinder profitability in the long run, even with its rapid revenue growth. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this success? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with diminished risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
