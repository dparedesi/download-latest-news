By Greg Guenthner Posted October 29, 2024 Short sellers took a beating last week following Tesla’s post-earnings romp that shot the stock higher by more than 25%. TSLA posted its best trading day in over a decade when management announced it topped Q3 profit estimates and improved automotive gross margins. Just two days later, the shorts banked losses of $4.2 billion closing out bets against the stock during its historic rally, according to data from S3 Partners. Not bad for a company so many investors love to hate… It’s no secret Tesla is a company that evokes strong emotions from just about everybody. Whether we’re talking about Elon Musk’s politics or online trolling, the latest Cybertruck recalls, or dwindling demand throughout the EV space, even casual investors held negative opinions on Tesla following its ugly first-half performance. Tesla shares were driven into the ground despite a roaring bull market for mega-cap tech earlier this year. And even as the stock began to show signs of bottoming out over the summer, most investors continued to expect the worst. I started getting bulled up on TSLA in late June as the beaten-down stock approached a potential breakout at $200. My reasoning was simple: The stock chart was quickly improving, posting a positive reaction to mediocre earnings back in April. Meanwhile, the bearish arguments were getting louder. Well, that $200 breakout lit the fuse for a quick 30% rally in July. And after a hard reset, shares were once again perking up as the fourth quarter began. Following last week’s earnings beat, the stock is now green on the year and threatening to run to $300… and beyond. Why does any of this matter? Because TSLA’s earnings rally was a potential preview of what’s coming when more of the Mag 7 mega-caps report this week. Earnings are unavoidable for anyone with a trading timeframe longer than a couple of months. But momentum and swing traders can mostly avoid earnings surprises if they so choose. That’s usually my style: selling (or partially selling) open swing trades ahead of earnings announcements, and making a point to avoid jumping into a new play directly in front of an earnings release. But I do keep a close watch on earnings, specifically how the Street reacts to the numbers. If TSLA is any indication, we could be in for more than a few powerful post-earnings rallies this week as many of the biggest names report. Here’s what you should expect… Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)Market cap: $2.06 trillion Reports Tuesday (Oct 29) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.84 per shareRevenue – $86.39B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.95 per share Actual: $2.94 per share Revenue – Consensus: 64.38B Actual: $68.71B Google (I refuse to call this company Alphabet) missed its annual earnings estimates for the 2022 fiscal year. But revenue remained on track. The company is back in the habit of beating earnings regularly, crushing April’s estimates by 25%. Turning to the chart, we have a lovely setup for a post-earnings rally should the numbers impress investors: GOOG is up more than 90% since the Nov. 2022 bottom, yet it’s approximately 15% off its all-time highs logged on July 10. The stock decisively cleared its 2021 peak in April, breaking into new all-time highs. Price has retested those former highs, found support, and now challenges the upper bounds of a multi-month consolidation. I love springboard plays like this where price retests an area of resistance-turned support. GOOG has already started to bounce – and could quickly run back to those all-time highs near $200 following a positive earnings reaction. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Market cap: $3.56 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.59 per shareRevenue – $94.46B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $1.34 per share Actual: $1.40 per share Revenue – Consensus: $393.09B Actual: $383.29B AAPL is a beast, and arguably the most magnificent of the seven mega-caps. The company has exceeded earning estimates since 2020 – no small feat! And it has crushed its past four earnings reports. Oh, and did I mention the chart is a thing of beauty? Check it out: The stock is up more than 85% off its early 2023 lows. And despite a maximum drop of approximately 30% during its most recent drawdown, the stock continues to power higher off each and every one of those lows. AAPL shares are coiled tightly just below all-time highs. Barring a major negative surprise or a seismic shift in the market, it’s difficult to imagine this stock failing to post new highs in the weeks ahead. Microsoft (MSFT) Market cap: $3.18 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $3.10 per shareRevenue – $64.57B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.94 per share Actual: $2.95 per share Revenue – Consensus: $244.82B Actual: $245.12B Like many companies, Microsoft had a tough time during the 2022 bear market, missing top and bottom line estimates. But it’s back on track and exceeding quarterly projections. Everyone on Wall Street is expecting a strong performance. If MSFT’s performance off its 2022 lows is any indication, we should see a continuation higher: MSFT has more than doubled since Nov. 2022. But the stock has essentially moved sideways for the past eight months. It’s now about 10% off its all-time high set back in July. The big question: Can MSFT escape its choppy, sideways range and continue higher? We’ll see if Wednesday’s earnings can ignite a fresh move higher to begin the journey… Meta (META)Market cap: $1.46 trillion Reports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $5.21 per shareRevenue – $40.19 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $14.41 per share Actual: $14.87 per share Revenue – Consensus: $133.68B Actual: $134.90B Meta was one of the hardest-hit tech names of the 2022 bear market. The company had just changed its name from Facebook to Meta and was feeling the heat, falling short of earnings estimates as the stock sunk into the abyss. But Meta has miraculously gone from worst to first since bottoming out in late 2022. Now, it’s back on track delivering beats since Q1 of last year. Just look at that comeback rally: Say what you like about Zuck and his metaverse plans – META is up 545% off its 2022 lows. Today it sits just about 5% off its all-time highs posted earlier this month. The stock just completed a 5-month consolidation on its way to new all-time highs, making it the strongest chart of the Mag 7s heading into earnings. A solid beat could keep the party going to $600 and beyond… Amazon (AMZN) Market cap: $1.99 trillionReports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $1.14 per shareRevenue – $157.26 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.70 per share Actual: $2.90 per share Revenue – Consensus: $570.87B Actual: $574.78B Here’s the thing about AMZN: those boxes will keep showing up on your doorstep, no matter what. But the company hasn’t exactly set the world on fire lately. Revenue fell short in 2021 and earnings missed in 2022, yet it steadily beats estimates since the start of 2023. Is there a bigger comeback in the works? Let’s check the chart: If you had to pick a dog to run with TSLA, it has to be AMZN. While we’ve witnessed a strong comeback from its 2022 lows, the stock has yet to post a significant rally above its 2021 peak. If AMZN can impress investors this week, could we finally see a bigger breakout? It’s possible! This is a great chart from a risk/reward standpoint.

Title: This 8% Dividend Is The Perfect Buy As Markets Turn Choppy

Old man and the sea, in a rowboat or skiff paddling and fighting the waves of the ocean. I get it if you’re a bit wary of this latest market rally: We’ve got a volatile (to say the least!) election now days away. And while the Fed says rates are headed lower, there’s still a lingering uncertainty about where, exactly, they’ll land. While a bit of anxiety is understandable, we do not want to make the same mistake many “vanilla” investors do at times like these: go all into cash. For one, humans are terrible at predicting the future—remember those warnings of a 100% chance of a recession in 2023?—so safe to say a good number of today’s investment worries are unlikely to come to pass. Worse, for us dividend investors, going to cash carries an extra cost: We lose our income stream. And if you’re in closed-end funds (CEFs), you stand to lose a lot of income indeed: CEFs yield around 8% as I write this, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service yields even more: around 9.4% as I write this. Just as a fast aside before we go further: One thing that bothers me about the discussion around CEFs these days is that people who don’t know much about them talk about them like they’re speculative investments. Nothing could be further from the truth: Fact is, CEFs are heavily regulated. Just like big companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) or Walmart (WMT), CEFs must account for their operations and file statements with the SEC every quarter. Even more reassuringly, most CEFs are managed by big financial institutions, which have a lot of investment resources at their disposal, as well as access to top portfolio-management talent and deep connections in the markets in which their funds operate. So instead of going to cash, we’re taking a pragmatic, dividend-focused (and CEF-focused) approach to the potential volatility ahead: We’re going to: The first thing that jumps out about ADX (besides the dividend yield) is its age: This one has been around since 1929, so it’s weathered the Great Depression, Second World War, soaring rates, falling rates, financial crises, a pandemic, you name it. (I’ve actually heard of some people who pass their holding in ADX down from generation to generation.) Adams has parlayed its long institutional experience into a stellar total return for ADX—nearly 3,500% since late 1988! This is where the fund’s value comes in, because as I write this, ADX trades at an 11.5% discount to NAV, letting us buy in below the value of its assets. (Or 11.5% less than where these stocks trade today, if you were to buy them “direct” yourself.) This discount is a holdover from a few months back, when the fund had a policy of paying most of its dividend as a year-end special payout that could be difficult to predict. Many CEF investors either didn’t understand the payout structure or were too impatient, so they left ADX aside. But management changed that policy and now will pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That should help ADX’s discount narrow, pulling its price up as it does. And either way, ADX’s policy really amounts to “translating” its portfolio gains into an income stream for you and me. Given the general direction of the market is up over the long term, it’s fair to expect our payouts to rise in the long run, too. Meantime, the fund’s portfolio is extremely modern. Its holdings have a strong tech bent, giving us a chance to buy rapid growers like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) at that 11.5% discount. ADX Portfolio Plus, as you can see, these top holdings also give us a smattering of non-tech names, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The 8% yield means that an investment of $500,000 in ADX would kick out roughly $40,000 of annual income, allowing you to live off dividends while reducing the need to draw down your principal. Here’s another fun fact: While the vast majority of that quadruple-digit return ADX has posted since 1988 was in dividend payouts that were then reinvested, the payout hasn’t hogged the entire spotlight: Shares traded for around $9.75 each back in 1988 and have more than doubled since: They’re around $22 now. So even if you took out all of those dividends and spent them to pay your bills, take vacations, invest elsewhere, whatever—you still saw your original buy double. Not bad!

Title: AMD to report Q3 earnings as AI takes center stage again

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings report will give investors and analysts a look at what to expect from Nvidia when it announces its own earnings on Nov. 20. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

October 28, 2024 12:15 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on November 01, 2024 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective November 04, 2024: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty-five shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately twenty-five-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 04, 2024. The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for- twenty-five reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-25 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere, stocks in Japan rallied after the country's ruling party failed to hold onto its majority in elections on Sunday — underscoring political risks to markets with the US presidential vote just days away. Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

Tel Aviv’s attack against Iranian military facilities early Saturday were in response to Tehran’s missile strikes on October 1. Oil was volatile in the weeks preceding the retaliation with Brent touching $80 per barrel as traders speculated whether Israel would strike against Iran’s oil infrastructure.

U.S. stock futures are higher as investors prepare for big tech earnings this week; McDonald's (MCD) is bringing its Quarter Pounders back to more than 900 restaurants following an E. coli outbreak; Boeing (BA) announces a $19 billion capital raise amid a costly strike; U.S.-listed shares of Philips (PHG) are plunging as the Dutch conglomerate lowers its full-year sales outlook on a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand; and crude futures are sinking after an Israeli strike on Iran spared the country's oil facilities. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as investors prepare for a busy week of earnings and economic data. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) all report quarterly earnings this week, and the tech giants have helped the Nasdaq post gains for seven straight weeks and advance 0.7% in premarket trading Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% after delivering losses in each session last week, while S&P 500 futures also are higher, by 0.5%. Gold is trading lower, while bitcoin is up about 1%. McDonald's (MCD) will bring its Quarter Pounders back to the menu in more than 900 restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming, as well as portions of nine other states, after an E. coli outbreak last week. Company officials identified slivered onions from distributor Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility as the likely source, and won't be serving them on the burger when sales resume there. The news comes ahead of McDonald's third-quarter earnings Tuesday, with analysts expecting revenue to rise but profits to drop slightly. Shares of McDonald's are up by 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced it will seek to raise more than $19 billion in capital through public offerings of common stock and depositary shares. The aircraft maker will offer 90 million shares of common stock, which at its most recent closing price of $155.01 would be valued at $13.95 billion, as well as $5 billion in depositary shares. Boeing will use the funding for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt it said. The move comes as Boeing has been struggling with a strike by its union machinists that has lasted more than six weeks. Shares of Boeing initially rose on the news but are now 1% lower in premarket trading. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Koninklijke Philips (PHG) are 17% lower in premarket trading after the Dutch conglomerate cut its 2024 sales outlook amid a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand. Philips said it now expects 2024 comparable sales growth between 0.5% and 1.5%, down from its previous forecast of between 3% and 5%. The company's third-quarter revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) all came in lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Oil prices are sinking after Israel avoided hitting energy facilities in its latest strike on Iran. Israel struck several Iranian military facilities Saturday in retaliation for an earlier attack by Iran, but did not disrupt its oil operations. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are falling by almost 6% to trade at around $67.60 a barrel, while Brent crude is down more than 5% at $71.40 a barrel. Iran makes up about 4% of the global oil trade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. OpenAI and its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT), are discussing how to divide up the spoils of the artificial intelligence upstart when OpenAI becomes a for-profit company, but agreeing on a fair market value for those assets will be a tall task. It all depends on who is doing the math, according to legal experts. "The issue is that there are probably six to 10 different ways to value a company," said Columbia University Business School professor Angela Lee. "And depending on who you ask, and my guess is, depending on which model you use, you could be off by a factor of like 3x to 5x." Arriving at a precise valuation for the startup responsible for ChatGPT will be nearly impossible, added Case Western Reserve University corporate law professor Anat Alon-Beck. "I suggest that any valuation in this context should be treated as a range rather than a definitive figure, given the inherent uncertainties," Alon-Beck said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that OpenAI and Microsoft hired Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to advise them on these discussions after OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round valuing it at $157 billion. Microsoft, among the investors in the latest funding round, has now devoted a total of nearly $14 billion to OpenAI since 2019. The question is how much equity Microsoft should receive in a new for-profit OpenAI in exchange for that $14 billion. There are also other thorny questions about rights to future profits that need to be ironed out. These issues are being debated while the bonds between the two companies start to show signs of wear, according to reporting in The New York Times, as financial pressures, executive exits, and disagreements among employees take their toll. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year, according to the Times. OpenAI’s current implied valuation of $157 billion would put it on par with the market caps of some of America’s largest and best-known companies, including Goldman, the Wall Street giant offering OpenAI advice during the talks with Microsoft. Goldman is currently valued just north of $160 billion. Lee said there are understandable justifications for OpenAI's $157 billion valuation, but critics could reasonably argue the figure is off base. "When talking about hyper-growth companies like Open AI, we are basing it off what it could be valued in five to 10 years," Lee said. "So you don't have performance. You're basing it off potential, and that's why this is so difficult." Arguments can be made for or against a higher or lower number. On one hand, OpenAI’s in-demand industry of artificial intelligence and its meteoric pace of growth both justify pushing up its valuation, according to Lee. On the other hand, she said, its business model hasn’t shown a path to profitability, losing roughly $1 billion per year. That, coupled with a market that’s been slow for dealmaking, should drive down the price, Lee added. Alon-Beck said "information asymmetry" and legal compliance requirements to switch from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity also make traditional valuation techniques less reliable. "The organization’s proprietary models, algorithms, and decision-making processes are not fully transparent to potential investors," Alon-Beck said, and that could cause investors to overestimate or underestimate the value. The reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago. It began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits. Things got more complicated in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including the billions from Microsoft. It was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power. The inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023 when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later. In the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny. What could make these negotiations even more challenging for OpenAI is that unfair compensation to the nonprofit could expose OpenAI to legal challenges, according to Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. State attorney generals, particularly in Delaware where the nonprofit is registered, could file suit against parties that violate that legal requirement. "One question the investment bankers have to ask is how realistic people are about the valuation … even the negotiation," she said. "I'm wondering who's going to speak for the nonprofit because the other side might have incentive to devalue it." On top of that, Chan Loui said, fair market value would typically include a premium to the nonprofit for giving up future participation and majority control. Microsoft, legal experts said, should be prepared for significant ongoing outlays to transition away from a nonprofit model, as more money will be needed for the valuation work, legal compliance, and operational integration. OpenAI has said it would seek to become a public benefit corporation (PBC), which is required to balance shareholder interests with broader societal benefits. "Microsoft’s financial exposure is not limited to its initial investment," Alon-Beck said. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

Title: Bitcoin is better than gold — even as gold hits record highs. Here's why

Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL-1.31%), Nvidia (NVDA-0.98%), Microsoft (MSFT+0.67%), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Microsoft's Earnings

UPDATE—Oct. 30, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price information. Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report fiscal first-quarter earnings results after markets close Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching growth in the company's Azure cloud computing platform. Analysts expect revenue to jump 14% year-over-year to $64.47 billion. Net income is projected to land at $23.21 billion or $3.11 per share, up from $22.29 billion or $2.99 per share a year earlier. In the prior quarter, Microsoft reported cloud revenue of $36.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, but short of the $37.2 billion analysts expected. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure, accounted for $28.5 billion in revenue, driven by a 29% jump in revenue from Azure and other services. Deutsche Bank analysts said they expect Azure to post a percentage in the low-to-mid 30s for the fiscal first quarter, adding Microsoft “needs to deliver Azure outperformance and guidance for little if any deceleration” in order to satisfy investors' lofty expectations. Microsoft told investors when it reported earnings in July that it would raise its investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in order to meet AI demand. Worries about whether Microsoft's higher spending will pay off weighed on the company's stock price in the wake of the report. Goldman Sachs analysts said they view Microsoft's buildout as a "necessary investment ahead of the structural shift to Gen-AI, which is likely to present a vast revenue opportunity across all layers of the AI technology stack." Microsoft announced several new AI-related features and initiatives in recent weeks, including upgrades to its Copilot AI assistant and autonomous AI agents for Copilot. Shares of Microsoft have gained over 16% since the start of the year, at $437.82 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the company's earnings release.

Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is back in the news, with its stock trading at a 25-year high. TradingView’s recent data shows that MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $235.89 in Thursday’s session. The stock’s price increased by more than 7% on October 25th. MicroStrategy’s price action last Thursday continued its 6-week rally and came ahead of its scheduled Q3 earnings report. This week’s stock performance reflected the company’s consistent growth over the past few years. MicroStrategy has outperformed most of its peers in the S&P 500 index and even outpaced Microsoft’s growth since 1999. According to observers, MicroStrategy is bullish, with market analysts listing $245 as the stock’s next target. MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based Bitcoin development company, is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with 252,222 BTC. With Bitcoin’s current price of $67,392, the company holds more than $17 billion in assets. MicroStrategy Stock Hits New Highs MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has soared over 7% to a 25-year high of $236, with a current market cap of $47 billion, overtaking Microsoft in all-time stock gains. Since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset in 2020, MicroStrategy’s stock is up… pic.twitter.com/cyXS0KODCD — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) October 25, 2024 Initially, the company developed software to analyze external and internal data to help decision-making, with IBM Cognos, Oracle Corporation’s BI Platform, and SAP AG Business objects as its primary competitors. However, in August 2020, the company changed its business model to focus on Bitcoin. The company has raised $4.25 billion from its equity offerings, the foundation for growing its Bitcoin holdings. As part of its Bitcoin plan, it aims to buy BTC at every opportunity. For the most part, Saylor’s strategy was a hit. However, the business plan to focus on Bitcoin came at a cost, and Saylor earned a few detractors and critics along the way. For example, the company has expanded its convertible note offering to raise funds to buy more Bitcoin. However, the bulk of these notes do not mature until 2032. Some market observers also say that MicroStrategy is in a difficult situation, especially during market downturns. Since the company relies on Bitcoin, the company’s future is dependent on crypto’s extreme volatility. Although most criticisms are valid, Michael Saylor remains defiant and has since doubled its BTC investments. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 Market observers are now bullish on Saylor’s company. According to Mark Palmer, the company’s stock has boasted a 17.8% yield since starting its Bitcoin strategy. Palmer and the other analysts now target $245 to address this sudden surge and bullish sentiment. Palmer adds that the company’s share price has increased by 1,600% in the last four years, and more gains are possible. It also helps that Michael Saylor has remained steadfast in his vision and passion for Bitcoin. In a recent Twitter/X post, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman hinted at the company’s next move and made a pitch to Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

The era of double-digit growth in the stock market may be coming to an end.

UPDATE—Oct. 30, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price information. Meta (META) will report earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with investors watching whether the social media giant's stock can keep up its strong performance so far this year. Analysts expect Meta to post third-quarter revenue of $40.27 billion, surging nearly 18% year-over-year. Net income is projected to land at $13.58 billion or $5.21 per share, up from $11.58 billion or $4.39 per share a year ago. Meta shares popped after the social media giant reported in July that it's seen early gains from artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize user engagement, benefitting its ad business. Deutsche Bank analysts told clients earlier this month they expect Meta's AI-driven optimization campaign to continue to bring "durable ad wallet share gains.” Meta posted advertising revenue of $38.33 billion in the second quarter, with the Street consensus sitting at $39.56 for the third quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta AI is "on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.” In September, Meta released Llama 3.2, its most capable open-source AI model yet, in its efforts to compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Ahead of the company's earnings call, Bank of America analysts called the social media giant a “top AI pick,” pointing to strong core ad growth, growing core app usage among younger users, and the capability of the company’s large language model. All but two of the 30 analysts covering Meta tracked by Visible Alpha hold a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $613.72, implying about 3% upside from Wednesday's intraday price. Meta shares have surged nearly 70% since the start of the year, at $596.21 in Wednesday morning trading.

Title: Tesla's Stock Taps the Brakes, But It's Still Rising—And So Is the Magnificent Seven

Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Title: NUKZ: Brand-New Nuclear Energy ETF is one of 2024’s Hottest ETFs

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The brand new Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) is one of the hottest ETFs of 2024, gaining nearly 70% since its launch in January. And while AI and large-cap tech have gotten most of the limelight from investors this year, NUKZ focuses on a different segment of the market entirely – nuclear energy. That said, NUKZ is still an intriguing way to potentially gain backdoor exposure to the growth of AI, the growing need for data centers, and other big tech themes. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to its impressive performance and its exposure to uranium producers, utilities, and manufacturers that are essential for the potential shift toward nuclear energy. This transition is becoming increasingly urgent as the need for sustainable energy solutions becomes more evident. The NUKZ ETF was launched on January 23, 2024, by Range ETFs. It is still a small fund with $40.7 in assets under management (AUM), but it picked a good time to debut as investor interest in nuclear energy is reaching new heights in 2024. According to Range ETFs, NUKZ “is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction & services, and fuel.” Nuclear energy is a clean and efficient form of energy. It produces no greenhouse gases, and it is more efficient and reliable than solar or wind energy. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy finds that the typical nuclear plant has a capacity factor of 92.5%, meaning it is working at full capacity 92.5% of the time, versus just 35.4% for wind and a paltry 24.9% for solar. Nuclear energy is a baseload energy source that is more reliable than solar and wind. Consulting firm McKinsey forecasts that electricity demand will triple by 2050, so there is clearly a need for the efficient and clean baseload energy that nuclear can provide. Plus, with so much demand likely to come online, there is room for multiple winners as nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas will all be needed, so this isn’t a zero-sum game. The AI revolution is also putting a finer point on this growing demand for power. More data centers are being built to house the computing power that hyperscalers need to power their AI solutions, and nuclear energy can play a key role in providing them with clean energy. Already, we’ve seen mega-cap tech companies commit to and invest in nuclear energy. Amazon recently announced its support for several new nuclear projects in Washington and Virginia, including the construction of new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an exciting new breed of nuclear reactor with a smaller physical footprint and shorter lead time. Also, Alphabet (GOOG) announced it will buy nuclear power produced by SMRs that will be developed by a company called Kairos Power. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) struck a deal with major power company Constellation Energy (CEG) to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. NUKZ owns 39 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 53.4% of its assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of NUKZ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. The fund’s largest holding is Cameco (CCO), the world’s largest uranium producer. Beyond Cameco, NUKZ also owns utilities like Constellation Energy, which maintains the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States with 21 nuclear reactors. The fund also owns NuScale Power (SMR), which makes the types of small module reactors discussed above. There’s also a place for Industrials, like GE Vernova (GEV) and Honeywell (HON) within the NUKZ ETF. GE Vernova manufactures nuclear turbine islands used by nuclear plants, while Honeywell operates a uranium conversion facility that makes a component needed for the enriched nuclear fuel utilized by nuclear reactors. One word of caution is that as a new ETF with relatively low assets under management, NUKZ is an expensive ETF, charging a fee of 0.85%. This means that an investor allocating $10,000 into the fund will pay $85 in fees on an annual basis. This is considerably more expensive than the fees many investors are used to seeing with broad-market index ETFs, and well above the average expense ratio for all ETFs (0.52%). If the ETF continues to perform well over the long term, the high expense ratio won’t trouble many holders, but it is something for investors to keep in mind, especially if the ETF’s performance begins to lag. Aside from the high expense ratio, other risks to this investment include the fact that it is a new ETF without a long-term track record, and a very small one at that, so it could prove volatile. Stocks in this space have already had quite a run in 2024, so there could be volatility to the downside. However, overall, I believe this is still a good long-term investment, as we are still in the early stages of the nuclear story. Turning to Wall Street, NUKZ earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average NUKZ stock price target of $42.38 implies about 2.0% upside potential from current levels. I’m bullish on NUKZ due to the increasing demand for clean and efficient baseload energy as electricity consumption rises. The recent embrace of nuclear energy by major tech firms like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft underscores its importance in powering data centers and is attracting new investor interest in these stocks. Moreover, we are still in the early stages of the transition to nuclear energy. While NUKZ has performed well in 2024, there is likely significant upside potential ahead, though volatility is expected along the way. Additionally, NUKZ provides a solid way to gain broad exposure to the nuclear energy sector, investing in uranium producers like Cameco, utilities such as Constellation Energy, and reactor manufacturers like NuScale.
