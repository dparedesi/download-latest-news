Title: Amazon Is Set To Report Earnings Today. Here's What Investors Should Know
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-is-set-to-report-earnings-today-what-investors-should-know-11840316
Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:55:58Z
Full Content:
Amazon is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday, and all eyes are likely to be on the e-commerce giant’s cloud business. Amazon is expected to report third-quarter revenue of about $178 billion, a 12% increase from last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Its earnings are expected to increase 10% to $1.57 a share. While Amazon’s e-commerce operation makes up the bulk of its business, investors will be most focused on its AI efforts, represented by cloud revenue and capital expenditures. Amazon’s cloud growth of 17.5% in the second quarter exceeded official expectations, but disappointed Wall Street after two blowout reports from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). On Wednesday, both of those companies again posted cloud revenue well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, setting another high bar for Amazon to clear. Amazon's array of businesses spans e-commerce, logistics, advertising, cloud computing and more, making its results a partial reflection of the financial health of U.S. consumers and businesses. Its market capitalization—well over $2 trillion as of midday Thursday—makes its stock one of the most influential in the stock market. Investors may also be primed for Amazon to increase its capital expenditures guidance after Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META) did so with their reports Wednesday. Amazon’s second-quarter capex of $32.2 billion was about 25% higher than analysts expected. Wedbush analysts expect Amazon’s full-year capex to total $119 billion, implying growth of about 10% between the first and second halves of this year. “We are constructive on the setup leading into the report given positive commentary around [Amazon Web Services] growth, healthy trends for the core retail business, and strong advertiser demand,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a note late last week. Amazon stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven recently, with shares up just 3% since the start of the year. Concerns about tariffs and lagging cloud growth have weighed on the stock. Some investors see the potential for shares to close the gap with the rest of the Mag 7 after earnings. Options prices on Thursday morning suggest traders expect Amazon stock to move about 6.3% in either direction by end of the week. A move higher off of Wednesday’s closing price would put shares around $244.75, which would be their first all-time high since early February, while an equivalent decline would put the stock at about $216. Wall Street is generally bullish on the outlook for Amazon stock, with all 22 of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha assigning it a “Buy” rating. Their median price target of $270 is nearly 20% above the stock’s intraday price on Thursday. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect analysts’ estimates for Amazon's diluted earnings per share.

Stock futures are losing ground amid a barrage of earnings reports from major companies, as investors assess the latest developments in trade talks and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's warning that more rate cuts aren't a certainty; President Donald Trump said his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping resulted in a rare earths mineral agreement and a reduction in certain tariffs on China; shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are losing ground after the Magnificent Seven members reported results late yesterday, while Alphabet (GOOG) shares are surging after the Google parent reported more than $100 billion in quarterly sales; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are due to release their quarterly reports after the closing bell; and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the company reported strong sales of weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it." The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week. President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates. Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%.. More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models. Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Amazon Stock To Move After Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is slated to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and some traders are betting the results can lift the stock, the laggard of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, to a fresh record. Amazon stock is expected to move about 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to recent options pricing data. A move of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put Amazon shares at about $243.50, an all-time high, or $215. Amazon's $2.4 trillion market capitalization makes its stock one of the most impactful in the U.S. equity market. A big share price move after Thursday's results would have a larger effect on the major indexes than nearly every other stock. Amazon stock has moved an average of 4.7% following its four most recent earnings reports. Shares slumped more than 8% after the company in July reported cloud revenue growth that disappointed Wall Street after strong showings from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). The last time Amazon stock rose following an earnings report was this time last year, when the company topped sales and earnings estimates on strong cloud and advertising growth. Amazon is the worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven so far this year, with the company’s outsized tariff exposure weighing on shares. The stock is up just 5% since the start of the year. Amazon’s retail business is contending with increased tariff costs and increasingly squeezed consumers, while its cloud computing unit is making massive data center investments to meet demand for AI workloads. As such, cost savings will be top of mind for investors during Thursday’s earnings call with executives. Amazon on Tuesday announced it would cut 14,000 corporate roles, reportedly part of a larger downsizing that could see the company slash up to 30,000 office jobs, nearly 10% of its white collar workforce. And according to a recent New York Times report, some executives expect warehouse robotics to keep the company from hiring as many as 600,000 workers in the coming years. Cloud growth and capital expenditures will also be in focus. Amazon’s infrastructure investments totaled more than $31 billion in the second quarter, about 20% more than Wall Street was expecting. Chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky forecast the second quarter's spending would be "reasonably representative" of capex spending for the remainder of the year. Update—October 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and stock prices.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.
