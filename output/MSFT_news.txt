Tesla's (TSLA) stock has known only one direction in February: reverse. Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker dropped another 2% to $321 each in pre-market trading on Wednesday, continuing an eye-opening slide from their recent 52-week high. At its current pre-market price, Tesla's stock is down 33% since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for President Donald Trump — who was heavily backed by Musk. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven" group of tech megacaps: Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL). Musk's net worth — which is closely connected to the fortunes of Tesla — has plunged $54 billion year to date, according to Bloomberg data. He is still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $378 billion "The bears are owning the narrative," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me. And the bears have a lot to feast on regarding Tesla at the moment. For starters, numbers on Tesla sales in important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. "We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker," Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises "There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective," Rusch said. The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued. Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively. Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be "a little bit challenged" in the coming years, unless the company can "deliver on a number of promises" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.

Title: Palantir stock has been on a tear. But a reckoning could come soon

Palantir Technologies (PLTR-0.50%) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company’s bright earnings prospects won’t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it’s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That’s taken Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. “The stock’s not made of teflon,” said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an “extraordinary” level that can’t last forever. “Eventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,” Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter — a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir’s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts’ estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company’s earnings prospects. He said analysts’ estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang’s optimism about Palantir’s potential work for the Trump administration — and his caution about the stock’s immediate prospects. “Revenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter — but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,” Rechenthin said. He said he won’t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT-0.12%) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir’s AI Platforms (AIP). Palantir’s products will be deployed in Microsoft’s Azure cloud for government, including clouds for top secret use. —Britney Nguyen and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Title: 3 new reasons to dump Magnificent 7 stocks
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-new-reasons-to-dump-magnificent-7-stocks-200016898.html
Time Published: 2025-02-11T20:00:16Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up. "Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent," Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year. Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks — despite their sell-off — also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, "The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern." Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. "We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their fund’s beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years," Parker said. One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness. Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Mag Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found. With the investment thesis on the Mag Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Why Tesla's stock has been cratering

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Elon Musk may be President Trump's first buddy, but Tesla (TSLA) investors have swung back to focusing more on the company's fundamentals than the billionaire's close proximity to the Resolute desk. Their decision? To send Tesla's stock tumbling less than two months into 2025. Shares of the electric vehicle maker led by Musk are down 28% to $349.18 since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for Trump. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven," which includes Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL). At the time, enthusiasm was running high that Musk's fierce support of Trump would unlock big-time profits as driverless cars would get quicker approval — among other bullish lines of thinking. But since reaching that peak, Tesla's stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average, according to Yahoo Finance data. The next test of investor sentiment on Tesla is coming at $334, or the 100-day moving average. Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286. Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024. "Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note. Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target. The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous. For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers. On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. "They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter," Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results "kind of squishy." Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report. "Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition," Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.

Title: Why the Federal Reserve could shock the markets this summer: Economist

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. If there is shock coming to markets, it could arrive this summer. And it could be in the form of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok says the US economy is already running at a healthy 3% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth pace, supported by high stock prices, investments in AI data centers by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), and strong defense spending. Layering on Trump tariffs would add fuel to the economic fire and drive up inflation, warns the veteran economist. "So if with that backdrop we have policies that are now lifting inflation modestly from an already too high level, then my view would certainly be that then maybe we are not done with the Fed hiking rates. There is a risk that we could still have a rate hike later this year," Slok told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Slok believes that should inflation accelerate as tariffs take hold, the first rate hike from Fed could come at its mid-June meeting. More may follow, Slok says, which could surprise a market that has settled into the view of the Fed standing pat on rates this year — if not lowering them further. "If we have a significant increase in inflation because of a strong economy and potentially some policies that give a modest lift to inflation, then you could have several hikes later this year," Slok added. The seeds for a renewed bout of inflation are being planted. On Monday, president Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Last Tuesday, the president imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on top of existing tariffs on the country. China retaliated, placing tariffs on select chips and metals. It also began investigating Google (GOOG) and blacklisted US apparel brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, operated by PVH Corp. (PVH). Trump recently agreed to pause 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days. Estimates on the impact of tariffs on inflation vary, but economists agree there will some consequences. A new report from Deutsche Bank economists project the steel and aluminum tariffs alone could boost the core personal expenditures price index (PCE) — a key read on inflation — by 0.4%. Should the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go through, inflation could rise more than 3.5%, Deutsche Bank said. On this front, Goldman Sachs economists estimated "long-term" 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico imports could lift the PCE by 0.7% and hurt GDP by 0.4%. Slok says the market hasn't priced in the prospect of rate hikes yet. The markets would be forced to adjust their profit estimates lower, explained Goldman Sachs chief US strategist David Kostin. If the US implements sustained tariffs on exports consistent with those currently outlined, it would likely cut earnings per share for the S&P 500 by 2% to 3%, Kostin found. “If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed. If companies pass along the higher costs to end customers, then sales volumes may suffer. Firms may try to push back on their suppliers and ask them to absorb part of the cost of the tariff through lower prices," said Kostin. — Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of natural food company Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) fell 22.5% in the morning session after the company reported weak fourth-quarter results: its revenue, EBITDA, and EPS missed significantly. The company attributed the weak performance to "poor in-store performance in snacks, driven by marketing and promotion effectiveness, and supply chain challenges." Overall, this was a poor quarter. The shares closed the day at $4.19, down 10.3% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Hain Celestial? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Hain Celestial’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Hain Celestial and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 31.3% on the news that the company reported strong second-quarter results. Hain Celestial blew past analysts' EPS expectations, and its organic revenue growth also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, guidance was promising, with FY'25 organic sales expected to be flat (vs. -2% decline recorded in FY'24). Similarly, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow by mid-single digits, year on year, while free cash flow is expected to be at least $60m. Zooming out, this was a fantastic quarter, which is being reflected in the significant stock move. Hain Celestial is down 30.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.16 per share, it is trading 58.4% below its 52-week high of $10 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Hain Celestial’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $156.86.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: This 7.6% Dividend Can Protect Your Wealth From A Trade War

USA flag Canadian Flag Mexico Flag side by side Trade tensions ratcheted up to 11 this week, and I know that for many readers the wild swings we’re seeing can feel sickening. To you, I say that times like these are exactly why we hold the closed-end funds in our CEF Insider portfolio. Their high, steady dividends (more than 10% on average across the portfolio) let us collect our income while stocks regain their footing. We also avoid the trap of panic selling, then seeing the story whipsaw the other way, locking in our losses (which would’ve happened if you’d hit the sell button first thing Monday morning). That’s a key advantage of all CEFs. And perhaps the coolest thing here is that we have CEFs that are purpose-built for times like these, like the Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX)—current yield 7.6%. That’s because SPXX “goes on offense” in the form of exposure to S&P 500 stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), American Express (AXP) and Pfizer (PFE). At the same time, it plays “defense” with a strategy that creates more income when volatility ticks up. That strategy is the fund’s sales of covered-call options. These offer investors the right to buy SPXX’s stocks at a fixed time in the future, at a fixed price. If the stock fails to hit that price (more likely in a correction), nothing happens, and SPXX keeps the fee it charges for the option, fueling its 7.6% payout. Here’s how recent trade drama sets the table for SPXX and CEFs like it. No matter what ultimately happens, in terms of the length or level of tariffs ultimately imposed (and on whom), the question is to what extent they’d change the flow of funds between manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers. More important, we want to know whether those changes would result in less consumption and, as a result, economic troubles. For Canada, tariffs would almost certainly mean a recession, since 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. The situation is similar in Mexico. About 78% of that country’s exports go to the U.S., with the automotive, agricultural and energy sectors most likely to get hit. This, in turn, could cause prices for food from Mexico and energy from Canada to rise. This also explains why the U.S., Canada, and Mexico reached a deal to pause these tariffs for a month, which means investors don’t have to worry about the impacts of a potential trade war for now. But a month isn’t a particularly long time, and we can expect other factors influencing trade and prices to become more significant. Expect more discussion about other factors driving the price movements of food and energy that could offset the tariffs, such as the fact that Canada has boosted energy production, including 7% year-over-year increases in crude-oil output, according to the Canadian government. All of this leaves first-level investors — by those I mean the ones who stick mainly to the big-cap S&P 500 names — struggling to figure out if Trump’s tariffs will damage company valuations or not. One thing that’s for sure (as we CEF investors know well) is that, given that the worst-case scenario is for higher inflation, selling stocks and going to cash (which loses value faster as inflation rises) makes no sense. Further, a U.S. recession is unlikely, as early indicators of over 3% GDP growth suggest the economy is firing on all cylinders. Even in a scenario where China, Canada and Mexico were to retaliate in full, America just doesn’t export enough for that to hit the entire economy all at the same time. A jittery stock market underpinned by a still-strong economy is perfect for SPXX and other covered-call CEFs. That fact is starting to catch more investors’ attention. Consider that since I wrote about SPXX here on Contrarian Outlook in late November, it has returned about 5%, as of this writing, while the S&P 500 has been flat. Market volatility has been driving SPXX’s performance, and the attention that’s been attracting has shrunk its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the stocks it holds) to 4.7%. Note that SPXX’s discount hasn’t flipped to the big premium it saw in 2022, when investors were hunting for pretty well anything that could give them a volatility hedge. And if fears keep growing — on tariffs or whatever else — expect SPXX’s discount to flip to a premium (taking its market price with it). Meantime, buying SPXX now means collecting its 7.6% dividend while we wait for that to happen. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
