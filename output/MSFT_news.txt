November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: Wall Street's Biggest IREN Bull Hiked Price Target to $142 After $9.7B Microsoft AI Deal

Wall Street continues to try and stay ahead of the hot-handed IREN (IREN) after yesterday's $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to supply 200 megawatts (MW) of AI data center capacity. The company's biggest sell-side fan is Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch. Bullish on the stock this past summer when it was trading for $10 and continually hiking his price target since, Knoblauch yesterday raised again, this time to $142 from $100. That implies more than a 100% upside from yesterday's close of $67.75. Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, meanwhile, said the deal with MSFT cements IREN's position as one of the few infrastructure players owning its own power assets. He hiked his IREN price target to $125 from $75 and reiterated its outperform rating. The pact could generate $2 billion in annual recurring AI cloud revenue for IREN by 2027, on top of roughly $500 million from existing operations, Chhugani said. Unlike competitors such as CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), IREN’s 2.9 gigawatt (GW) portfolio allows it to expand in line with demand without relying on co-location partners, a structure which will boost profitability, Chhugani continued. Chhugani now forecasts $2.5 billion in AI cloud revenue by 2027, up from $1.1 billion previously, and values IREN’s Sweetwater site at $5 million per megawatt, based on recent M&A multiples. Further, the Microsoft deal taps only about 10% of IREN’s total power capacity across British Columbia and Texas, leaving scope to scale further with Microsoft or other hyperscalers. Roth Capital has also lifted its price target to $94 from $82. Shares are lower by nearly 5% early Tuesday alongside a general swoon in markets, with Nasdaq futures down 1.5% and bitcoin threatening to tumble below $100,000 level.
