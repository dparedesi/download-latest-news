Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA-6.02%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+4.39%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL-0.41%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT-1.25%), Google (GOOGL-0.55%), Meta (META-4.53%) or Amazon (AMZN-4.34%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA-5.49%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR-10.49%), Salesforce (CRM-2.21%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.
