Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) With a 15% rise year-to-date (YTD), Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) has fared much better than the broader S&P 500 index, which has gained just 2%. This outperformance is partly attributed to rising demand for Azure amid the AI boom. Microsoft’s substantial AI investments, especially its partnership with OpenAI, have made Azure a highly appealing cloud platform for businesses looking to integrate AI into their operations. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, MSFT stock has doubled since early 2023, supported by three major factors: We’ll examine these drivers in more detail. While MSFT stock has delivered strong returns, those seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks might explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see Archer Aviation: What’s Happening With ACHR Stock? Microsoft has demonstrated solid fundamental performance with a 32% rise in revenue, growing from $198 billion in 2022 to $270 billion in the trailing twelve months. This growth is fueled by several enduring factors: Microsoft's stock has experienced a significant increase in valuation multiples, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio jumping 48% from 9x in 2022 to 13.3x currently. Several key factors are driving this sustained growth: Currently trading around $480, MSFT stock’s P/S multiple of 13.3x is slightly higher than its four-year average of 12.4x. Refer to Microsoft’s Valuation Ratios for additional context. We believe that Microsoft’s valuation is poised for further growth driven by strategic AI initiatives. Azure will benefit from rising enterprise AI adoption, increasing demand for cloud infrastructure, and AI platform services. Additionally, AI integration across Microsoft 365 will boost productivity, enhance user workflows and collaboration, leading to higher subscription retention and premium tier adoption. These AI features are also expected to strengthen Teams engagement, drive enterprise software licensing growth, and accelerate the shift to higher-value cloud services as businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft's comprehensive AI-powered ecosystem. Despite the strong outlook, there are notable risks. In the inflation-led 2022 downturn, MSFT stock dropped 38%, declining from a high of $343 in November 2021 to $214 in November 2022. In contrast, the S&P 500 saw a smaller decline of 25%. Although MSFT rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by June 2023, a similar sell-off occurred earlier this year amid trade war concerns, where MSFT fell nearly 20%, aligning with a 19% drawdown for the S&P 500. More on this is available in our Buy or Sell Microsoft Stock dashboard. Apart from macro and geopolitical risks, Microsoft faces internal challenges, especially regarding its significant capital expenditures. Since 2022, the company’s capital expenditures bill has crossed $144 billion. A pressing question remains: What if these large-scale investments don’t yield the expected returns? Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 3 Big AI Dividends Cashing In On The Next Big Leap

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young Asian couple managing finance and investment online, analyzing stock market trades with mobile ... More app on laptop and smartphone. Making financial plans. Banking and finance, investment, financial trading, mobile banking concept Still wondering if artificial intelligence will replace human workers? Well, you can stop. Because it’s already happening—and boosting corporate profits (and AI dividends) as it does. That’s tough news for workers, of course. But there’s a silver lining for those of us investing for dividends. Because the “growth-without-hiring” trend AI has touched off is setting up one of the strongest income opportunities I’ve seen in years. (I’ll name three AI plays yielding up to 8.5% below.) Wait, AI is setting the stage for big dividends? I know. AI is known for a lot of things—many of which have been, er, less than helpful, such as infringing on copyrights and forcing McNuggets on pleading McDonald’s (MCD) drive-thru customers. But dividends? Most people will tell you that AI stocks are a dividend desert. They’re not exactly wrong. Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) pay somewhere between nothing and almost nothing. But we contrarians know to look deeper. For starters, the real AI magic isn’t in chatbots like ChatGPT. That’s surface-level stuff. It’s in applications, like the FedEx (FDX) Surround system, which uses AI to monitor and shift, if necessary, time-sensitive shipments. It’s in Meta’s recent proposal to use AI to run entire ad campaigns (including creative) based on an image of a client’s product and a budget. That could let smaller businesses access agency-level marketing, boosting their profits (and Meta’s, of course). As we mentioned earlier, yes, these changes will result in fewer hires. That’s already showing up in the numbers: Over the past year, Meta, for example, has raised revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Alphabet grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. Sure, Nvidia did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%. Microsoft, meantime, saw 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase. Tech firms are the thin edge of the wedge here. Other companies are going this way, too. This is where dividends come in because we can easily buy this trend through closed-end funds (CEFs) that: Here are three you can blend to get this sweet income (and gain!) setup. We’ll start with a “pure” tech fund and move through to one focused more on AI users than providers. The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks, with Broadcom (AVGO), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. STK also holds Visa (V) and fuel-cell-maker Bloom Energy (BE). Let’s call those “tech-adjacent.” STK sells call options on part of its portfolio, which generates extra income to support its 6.3% dividend. This strategy works well with tech stocks, as they tend to be more volatile. Moreover, portfolio manager Paul Wick has 38 years of experience and it shows: In the last five years STK’s total return has outpaced the NASDAQ, which we all know has been on a tear: STK Total Returns One thing to remember is that STK is on investors’ radar, so it trades at a premium to NAV. But that premium is well below the peaks it’s hit in recent years, making STK something of a bargain in disguise. That premium could turn some folks who don’t know STK’s history away, providing an opportunity to step in. The Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX), as the name says, holds NASDAQ stocks. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: 8.5%. Like STK, QQQX fuels its payout, in part, through option sales. QQQX’s portfolio of NASDAQ stocks includes the tech kingpins, plus firms like travel site operator Booking Holdings (BKG) that also benefit from “growth without hiring.” The fund’s 5.7% discount gives us another tailwind as it narrows and (likely, in my view) flips to a premium—something it’s long overdue for: QQQX Discount NAV Now let’s add more “tech-adjacent” holdings with … The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV) rounds out our trio with a focus on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses. Top holdings include Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and American Express (AXP). GDV yields 6.5% and is the steadiest payer of the bunch, with a payout that hasn’t been cut since the 2009 financial crisis. The fund’s discount has been stuck in double digits in recent years, but it has been narrowing lately. I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance. That would slingshot the fund’s price higher, adding gains to that 6.5% payout. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Amazon (AMZN) Analysis: Performance, Market Dynamics, and AI-Driven Insights as of June 17, 2025 (Serhii Bondarenko)

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains a titan in the technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing sectors, consistently shaping market trends through innovation and scale. As of June 17, 2025, AMZN’s stock has exhibited robust performance, driven by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and operational efficiencies. This article provides a comprehensive financial analysis of AMZN’s recent market movements, key news driving its performance, a comparison with a correlated stock, insights into trading with inverse ETFs, and the role of AI-driven tools in navigating its volatility. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, AMZN stock surged by 6.75%, outpacing the broader market and reflecting strong investor confidence in Amazon’s growth trajectory. This momentum continued into mid-June, with the stock rising 1.57% on June 16, 2025, according to The Motley Fool. Amazon’s year-to-date performance has been remarkable, with shares rebounding 42% from a 52-week low of $151.76, fueled by record earnings projections for 2025 and 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, Amazon reported a 62% year-over-year increase in earnings per share (EPS), with net sales reaching $155.7 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, posted $29.3 billion in sales, up 17% year-over-year, though margins softened slightly to 39.5%. Operating income climbed 20% to $18.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $17.48 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for Q2 2025 projects net sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, representing approximately 9% growth at the midpoint, with operating income expected between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted significantly, dropping from 90 in 2021 to 30 as of March 2025, while trading at 17 times operating cash flow, its lowest ever. This suggests AMZN may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, particularly given its 50% revenue growth and doubled operating margins since 2021. However, free cash flow declined 48% over the last twelve months, reflecting heavy capital expenditures, including a $100 billion+ investment planned for 2025, primarily in AI and AWS infrastructure. Several macroeconomic and company-specific developments have influenced AMZN’s stock movement as of June 17, 2025. On June 16, the broader market saw gains, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rising amid optimism over contained geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, boosting risk appetite. Amazon benefited from this sentiment, particularly due to its exposure to global trade. The company’s e-commerce operations, which account for nearly 40% of U.S. online sales, are poised to capitalize on easing trade tensions, as Amazon sells and facilitates imported goods. Additionally, Amazon’s partnership with Roku, announced on June 16, 2025, to create the “largest authenticated Connected TV (CTV) footprint” in the U.S. through Amazon Ads, drove a 10% surge in Roku’s stock and further bolstered AMZN’s advertising segment, which grew 18% year-over-year in Q1 2025. Amazon’s increasing reliance on AI to optimize operations, including robotics in its fulfillment network and custom silicon for AI workloads, has also garnered Wall Street attention, with analysts projecting new highs for AMZN in the second half of 2025. However, risks persist. High tariffs on Chinese imports, as noted by Zacks, could pressure Amazon’s retail margins, though the company’s diversified revenue streams—particularly AWS—mitigate this exposure. Softer-than-expected inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, reported on June 12, 2025, further supported growth stocks like AMZN, as lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for capital-intensive investments. Amazon’s stock performance is closely correlated with other mega-cap technology companies, particularly Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), due to their shared dominance in cloud computing and AI. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, MSFT gained 5.2%, trailing AMZN’s 6.75% increase, indicating Amazon’s stronger short-term momentum. Both companies benefit from the surging demand for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft’s Azure competing directly with AWS. However, Amazon’s broader exposure to e-commerce and advertising provides a diversified revenue base, giving it an edge in certain market conditions. While Microsoft’s cloud growth is robust, AWS’s projected 17-20% year-over-year growth and record-high margins of 39.5% in Q1 2025 underscore Amazon’s leadership in the cloud sector. Investors eyeing AMZN may find MSFT a complementary holding, but Amazon’s multi-sector presence makes it a more versatile growth play. For traders seeking to hedge or capitalize on AMZN’s volatility, inverse ETFs like the ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) offer a strategic tool. PSQ is designed to deliver daily inverse performance to the Nasdaq-100, which includes AMZN as a major holding. Given AMZN’s high correlation with the Nasdaq-100 (beta of approximately 1.2), PSQ provides a near-perfect anti-correlation, making it ideal for short-term strategies. When AMZN rallies, PSQ typically declines, and vice versa, allowing traders to profit from downward movements without shorting the stock directly. However, inverse ETFs carry higher risks due to daily rebalancing, which can lead to compounding losses in volatile markets. Traders must employ disciplined risk management, using tools like stop-loss orders, to mitigate these risks. Pairing AMZN with PSQ enables a balanced approach, capturing gains from bullish trends while hedging against potential corrections. The integration of AI into financial markets has transformed how investors approach stocks like AMZN. Advanced platforms leverage machine learning to analyze vast datasets, identifying patterns that human traders might miss. One such platform, led by CEO Sergey Savastiouk, utilizes Financial Learning Models (FLMs) to combine technical analysis with AI, offering precise entry and exit signals for high-liquidity stocks like AMZN. These tools, including user-friendly trading bots and Double Agents that detect both bullish and bearish signals, empower traders to navigate AMZN’s volatility with greater confidence. For instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for AMZN turned positive on June 6, 2025, signaling a bullish trend that AI-driven tools could have capitalized on. Such innovations highlight the growing role of AI in optimizing trading strategies. Amazon’s stock remains a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Its robust Q1 2025 performance, driven by AWS growth and operational efficiencies, positions it for further gains, though heavy capital expenditures and potential tariff pressures warrant caution. The company’s AI investments, including a 70% increase in in-house chip shipments projected for 2025, signal long-term growth potential. Traders can leverage AMZN’s momentum while using inverse ETFs like PSQ for hedging, supported by AI-driven tools to enhance decision-making. As market optimism grows with easing trade and geopolitical tensions, AMZN is well-positioned to lead the next phase of the tech bull market, potentially hitting new highs by year-end
