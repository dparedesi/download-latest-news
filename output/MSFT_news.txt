Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

Nvidia becomes world’s first $4 trillion company, marking a historic milestone in the AI-driven tech race. Surging 2.5% in stock value, Nvidia outpaced Apple and Microsoft to claim the top global spot. Fueled by skyrocketing demand for AI chips powering platforms like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, the chipmaker reported $44.1 billion in revenue last quarter. Despite export restrictions and challenges from Chinese rivals, Nvidia has rallied 74% since April. CEO Jensen Huang sees global AI expansion just beginning. With future projections hitting $6 trillion, Nvidia remains at the center of the AI revolution, reshaping the world’s industries, infrastructure, and innovation.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.
