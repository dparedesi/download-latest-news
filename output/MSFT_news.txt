Title: Buy Or Sell MSFT Stock At $510?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has excelled this year, with its stock climbing over 20%. This notably exceeds the broader market performance, as the S&P 500 is up 7%, and competitors like Amazon have achieved just a 5% increase, while Google has gained less than 1%. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to strong cloud expansion—Azure revenue alone surged 33% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025—and its ongoing advances in AI integration. Microsoft’s solid position in the emerging AI boom has undoubtedly been a significant factor contributing to investor trust. However, at the current price of $510, is there still potential for growth? We believe there is. We arrived at this conclusion by evaluating MSFT stock’s current valuation against its operating performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Microsoft, considering essential factors such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, indicates a company with robust operating performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. That being said, if you're looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 with returns surpassing 91% since its inception. On a separate note, is PepsiCo stock still appealing? See What’s Happening With PepsiCo Stock? When considering what you pay for each dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears costly relative to the wider market. Microsoft's Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft's profit margins significantly exceed those of most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft's balance sheet appears very robust. MSFT stock has demonstrated a performance slightly better than the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard – How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash – provides an in-depth analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft's performance across the aforementioned parameters can be summarized as follows: In summary, Microsoft stock has significantly excelled across all critical parameters, which contributes to its premium valuation. Currently priced at $510, the stock stands at 39 times its trailing earnings, marking a slight increase from its four-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 35. Nonetheless, we contend that this premium is warranted, and there exists the possibility for further growth. This optimism is fueled by impressive sales growth in Azure and improved profitability, as demonstrated by Microsoft’s operating margin expanding from 41.8% in 2023 to 45.2% now.

Of course, our evaluation may be incorrect, and investors might hesitate to pay an even higher premium for MSFT stock considering its already elevated valuation and other risks, such as the recent security breach. Nevertheless, if you have confidence that AI growth will persist, and you possess a 3-5 year investment perspective, Microsoft is likely to be a successful stock. Not particularly fond of the volatile nature of MSFT stock? Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio; it boasts a collection of 30 stocks and has a strong track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns while incurring less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
