Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating its stock could climb to all-time highs. Current options pricing suggests traders expect Microsoft stock could move nearly 4% in either direction from recent levels by the end of Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares to a fresh record near $531 or drop them to about $494, about where they were at the start of July. The shares hovered around $512 in recent trading, just below Friday's closing high after setting multiple records earlier this month. Microsoft's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 5% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. April was the exception, when shares jumped 8% the day after earnings as cloud and AI growth drove better-than-expected results. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings report, all 20 brokers covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" ratings for the stock. Their average price target around $580 represents a 13% premium over Tuesday's closing price just above $512. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft’s quarterly revenue and profits to have surged year-over-year amid growing AI demand. Wedbush analysts, who recently raised their price target to $600, said the company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and its cloud-computing platform Azure. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values.

Title: Watch These Microsoft Stock Price Levels as Tech Giant Set to Report Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday but remain near a record high as investors await the scheduled release of the company's quarterly results on Wednesday. Just as with other Magnificent Seven companies, investors will be seeking updates on the tech giant’s spending plans as the AI arms race among tech rivals intensifies. Last week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) lifted its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, up from its prior forecast of $75 billion. Microsoft shares slipped 0.2% to close Monday's session at $512.50. The stock has gained nearly 22% since the start of the year, boosted by strong growth in the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment and successful efforts to integrate AI into its Copilot chatbot and Azure cloud platform. Below, we break down the technicals on Microsoft’s chart and point out price levels worth watching out for. Since gapping decisively above the 200-day moving average (MA) in early May, Microsoft shares have trended steadily higher within as ascending channel. During this time, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA to form a bullish golden cross, while the relative strength index has remained near overbought territory to signal strong price momentum. It’s also worth noting that volatility has fallen sharply in the stock since it bottomed in early April as shown by the average true range percent indicator—a technical tool that signals how much an asset typically moves as a percentage of its price. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential upside target on Microsoft’s chart if the shares continue trending higher and also identify crucial support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast a potential upside target in the stock by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Microsoft’s chart, we calculate the height of the ascending channel from its low to high rounded to the nearest dollar and add that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, we add $93 to $527, which projects a target of $620, about 21% above today's closing price. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should watch for a retest of crucial support around $468. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near last year’s prominent July swing high. Finally, a decisive close below this level could see Microsoft shares drop to $430. This location finds a confluence of support from the closely watched 200-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a series of corresponding price action on the chart extending back to March last year.

Title: What Analysts Think of Microsoft Stock Ahead of Earnings

Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street resoundingly bullish on the software giant heading into the results. All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71. The shares have added about a fifth of their value in 2025 so far, hovering around $512 in recent trading. Wedbush, which has Microsoft on its "Best Ideas List," recently raised its price target to $600. The company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," Wedbush said, thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and the cloud-computing platform Azure. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, is expected to grow 22% to $28.96 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts have called Microsoft their "top pick," giving it a price target of $613. The bank said Microsoft has pricing and margin power that is "nearly unmatched in enterprise software." Jefferies analysts issued a price target of $600 earlier this month. Analysts on average expect Microsoft to report quarterly revenue of $73.86 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and net income of $25.27 billion, or $3.38 per share, compared to $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street will be watching for updates on Microsoft's AI spending ambitions in fiscal year 2026, which began this month. In April, CFO Amy Hood said capital expenditures are expected to grow this fiscal year, but at a slower rate than in fiscal 2025. Microsoft at the time said it expected $80 billion of capex in fiscal 2025. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last week raised its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion. Rival hyperscaler Meta (META), like Microsoft, is set to report earnings after the bell today. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are slated to follow tomorrow.
