Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) fell 9.7% in the afternoon session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected. Management noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025. Lastly, CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region. ASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's (ASML) critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Lam Research? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Lam Research’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 19 days ago when the stock gained 7.5% as semiconductor stocks, especially the memory chip manufacturers, surged after Micron reported impressive fourth-quarter earnings results. Micron beat across most of the key metrics we track, including revenue, operating profit, and EPS. Notably, the company recorded a whopping 93% revenue growth compared to the previous year, showing that the AI party is still ongoing. Micron attributed the outperformance to the growing demand for memory chips that power generative AI applications. Looking ahead, Micron provided strong sales and profitability guidance for the next quarter, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Overall, the result highlights the abundant growth opportunities for chip makers with technologies to accelerate the booming AI trend. Lam Research is up 3.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $77.41 per share, it is still trading 31.3% below its 52-week high of $112.73 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lam Research’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,198. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. Sign in to access your portfolio

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.

Title: Is Microsoft Stock Heading To A $4 Trillion Valuation? Taking Cues From Buyback And Dividend Hike Plans

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) After a jubilant runup to all-time highs, Microsoft (MSFT) shares are taking a pause subsequent to a protracted period of AI optimism for big techs. The tech giant’s elevated levels of AI capital spending that have yet to translate into tangible returns appear to be causing some unease among investors. Exacerbating the concerns, growth in Microsoft’s much-hailed Azure cloud services during the recent fourth quarter was perceived as weaker than expected. The beginning of a Fed rate easing cycle is also motivating investors to look beyond the overheated valuations of mega techs. Microsoft recently announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend alongside a mammoth share buyback program of up to $60 billion. Is the Microsoft stock a buy in view of its dividend hike and stock buyback plans? Where is the Microsoft stock headed? Is a $4 trillion valuation in the cards for the MSFT stock? After touching a 52-week intra-day high of $468.35 on July 5, the stock receded and closed at a low of $394.44 on August 5 following its fourth-quarter earnings release on July 30. Although MSFT reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter, the market chose to focus on the shortfall in its Azure cloud revenues. Azure is a key area of focus for analysts, as it competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Microsoft is going head-to-head with the other two for capturing new business. The investments towards Azure AI growth, drive a significant portion of the capex spend for MSFT. So, it’s good to know that AI services contributed 8 percentage points, accounting for more than a fifth of the growth in “Azure and other cloud services” revenue during the fourth quarter. In response to an analyst’s query in the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Microsoft attributed capacity constraints for impacting Azure growth, noting that AI demand remained higher than available capacity. These capacity restrictions alongside softness in non-AI consumption in some European geographies are expected to continue into the first half of fiscal 2025. However, Azure growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025, as capital investments should increase available AI capacity to serve the growing demand.

In July, Microsoft noted that its revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% year over year during the fourth quarter. (Typically, Microsoft does not disclose the dollar value of revenue for this category.) The growth was 30% in constant currency (assuming constant exchange rates) in line with Microsoft’s guidance for 30% to 31% growth, but fell short of the 31% growth pegged by analysts. It caught the market off-guard as Azure growth numbers have never missed estimates since 2022. The lack of visibility into cloud consumption trends also poses a problem. The Azure consumption business (in which businesses only pay for the resources and services consumed), which includes AI, has historically grown faster than the per user business. However, Microsoft typically features the slower-growing per-user pieces in the Azure and other cloud services’ revenue stream, complicating the visibility into the consumption of Azure. However, in August, Microsoft updated its reporting structure to enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI for the overall business. Under the new reporting framework, the slower growing per-user revenue streams such as the Power BI data analytics tool and the Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) product suite will be excluded from the closely monitored Azure and other cloud services metric. With the relocation of these two components, the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to the consumption business. However, Microsoft will be adding revenue from its search and news advertising category into Azure and other cloud services. So, the updated Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric will include revenue from Azure and other cloud services, including cloud and AI-consumption based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings and other cloud services. Subsequent to the reclassification, Microsoft restated its investor metrics, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth and updated its first-quarter guidance. Based on the restatement, revenue from Azure and other cloud services for the fourth quarter grew 34% to 35% in constant currency (vs. 29% to 30% growth in constant currency reported in July). For the first quarter, revenue growth for the new Azure and other cloud services is expected to be 33% in constant currency (vs. prior projections for growth of 28% to 29% in constant currency in July). Based on the takeaways from the July earnings call, there appears to be no slowdown in demand for Azure consumption. The quote from Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood, “Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure.” has a nice reassuring ring to it. With the reorganization in reporting structure, the upcoming first quarter earnings print will likely offer more helpful context on how Azure is shaping up for the second quarter and future periods. Microsoft’s intelligent digital assistants called Copilot streamline workflows. Copilot can help draft emails and reports, summarize documents, provide data insights, create presentations, generate software code and automate repetitive tasks. About 60% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Copilots. Copilot is used in GitHub (which is a code-sharing platform) for providing AI assistance in software coding. More than 77,000 organizations have adopted GitHub Copilot, and the number is up 180% year over year. The use of Copilot has pushed GitHub’s annual revenue run rate to $2 billion and accounted for 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is gaining solid traction; customers grew more than 60% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of people who used Copilot daily at work doubled. The number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis and EY, which alone is expected to deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. Copilot is still in the nascent stages of growth, but already showing great promise as a future driver of recurring revenue growth for MSFT. With the rollout of additional features and functionality, Copilot is expected to deliver even greater value. The Copilot add-on for Microsoft 365 plan costs $30 per user per month, while a basic business subscription for Microsoft 365 costs $6 per user per month, a standard business subscription costs $12.50 and a premium business subscription costs $22.50.

During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft addressed the elephant in the room–the raging industry debate about the monetization of its significant investments in generative AI. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, totaled $55.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (including $11.2 billion in first-quarter 2024, $11.5 billion in second-quarter 2024, $14 billion in third-quarter 2024 and $19 billion in fourth-quarter-2024) up 75% year over year. A bulk of the capex spend is towards cloud and AI-related investments. Microsoft said that nearly 50% of its capex went towards infrastructure needs, like the land and data center buildout, while the rest was decided by “demand signals.” CPUs or GPus will be bought only based on these demand signals. Azure AI growth, and recurring customers for Microsoft 365 Copilot are some of the demand signals that decide the trajectory of more than 50% of Microsoft’s capital spending toward cloud and AI-related investments. While responding to an analyst’s question, Microsoft said it could see consistent revenue growth even without this sort of elevated capital expense because of the variable nature of the capex. In what could be viewed as an elaboration on the demand signals, Microsoft said it witnessed record commitments to its Microsoft Cloud platform in the fourth quarter and commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations rising 17% (and 19% in constant currency) year over year, thanks to growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Microsoft has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year with the average spend per customer continuing to grow. Microsoft said that the expansion of its data center footprint targeting investments across four continents aimed to create long-term assets globally to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. Fiscal 2025 capex is expected to be higher vs. fiscal 2024, and tied to demand signals and adoption of its AI-based services. MSFT plans to be more disciplined to keep its opex growth in the single digit for fiscal 2025 to somewhat compensate for the higher capex. Besides, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion for fiscal 2024, resulting in an attractive free cash flow (FCF) generation of approximately $74 billion, even after the escalated spending. Strong FCF generation characteristics render solid support for Microsoft’s capital spending plans. MSFT appears to have adequately addressed the concerns regarding its capex boost for fiscal 2025. It is now up to investors to take a deep, long look and decide if they are comfortable with the answers. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% during the fourth quarter, of which 58 points were attributed to Activision. The acquisition of Activision has given Microsoft a strong content pipeline and a foothold in mobile gaming, a turf where it virtually had no presence before. In gaming, Microsoft now has more than 500 million monthly active users, across devices and platforms. Microsoft’s official cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming, allows a user to play native console games in the cloud and stream it to a phone, PC, or console. The game catalog for Xbox Cloud Gaming has more than 200 titles including a number of EA Play games that make it quite appealing for users. Xbox Cloud Gaming is only available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, a service that costs $19.99 a month. For the first quarter, Xbox content and services revenue is expected to grow in the low to mid-50s percentage. Gaming could likely turn out to be a good revenue avenue, amid the projected growth in the global cloud gaming market from an estimated $5.8 billion in 2023 to $9.7 billion in 2024, thanks to the rise in mobile cloud gaming, according to Fortune Business Insights. Microsoft has made partnerships the cornerstone of its growth strategy. To understand the economic value partners realize through their collaboration with Microsoft and its technology—particularly with AI, IDC conducted a global study (commissioned by Microsoft). A key finding of this web-based global survey of 638 Microsoft partners was the “partner multiplier” metric. For every $1 of Microsoft revenue, Microsoft partners who provide services generate $8.45 and partners who develop software generate $10.93. This compelling number could spur further partner-led growth for MSFT. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft noted that it “continues to prioritize security above all else.” It has more than 1.2 million security customers. “Defender for Cloud”—MSFT’s cloud security solutions for protecting customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the past year (as of July 31, 2024). It is interesting that Nadella should reinforce MSFT’s commitment to prioritize security above all else. On July 18, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a flawed software update, crashing millions of Windows devices. Microsoft pegged this estimate to 8.5 million Windows devices representing around 1% of all Windows machines. However, many of these customers were providers of critical services, like airlines and Banks. Although the outage was caused by the CrowdStrike update, Microsoft may likely face some pushback about the perceived chinks in its operating system. Of course, other risks include Microsoft not meeting its AI objectives and the subsequent repercussions that could stem from it. Cloud revenues and operating income for the latest June quarter: New data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, shows that second-quarter enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services totaled $79 billion globally, up 22% year over year. Amazon remained the market leader during the June quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Microsoft’s lead in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is narrowing. Microsoft had a head-start advantage in the space through its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. However, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic (the creator of Claude LLMs) and Google’s introduction of its Gemini model are leveling the playing field. Although ChatGPT remains the most popular chat-bot currently, experts opine that the offerings from Anthropic and Google have demonstrated superior performance vs. ChatGPT on various benchmarks. While Amazon and Google are playing catchup with ChatGPT, MSFT is adding its own in-house data center-bound AI chips, the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator for training and running AI models, and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU, which is optimized for general purpose workloads. As of now, MSFT accounts for nearly 20% of Nvidia’s revenues, while Google and Amazon represent about 5% each. With its own AI chips, MSFT has the potential to close the much-touted cost advantage with AMZN and GOOG. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. The new buyback authorization, which represents nearly 2% of MSFT’s market cap of $3.1 trillion, has no expiration date and replaces a $60 billion buyback program announced in 2021. Shareholder return initiatives are not new for Microsoft, which returned more than $34 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in fiscal 2024. The company has repurchased shares consistently over the last two decades. However, the new buyback authorization does signal that the tech giant remains committed to robust free cash flow generation, despite its elevated AI-driven investments. Atop the battle for AI dominance, the top tech majors are also actively competing on buyback and dividend programs, which bodes well for shareholders. In May, Apple announced the biggest-ever $110 billion stock buyback authorization, following Google parent Alphabet’s $70 billion buyback authorization announcement in April. Microsoft ranks third so far this year in terms of buyback size. In February, Meta authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases, which represented 5% of its $1 trillion market cap at the time. Meta’s market cap has since grown by 50% to $1.5 trillion. Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend payout by 10% or 8 cents to $0.83 per share from the present $0.75 per share and made the announcement in mid-September along with the buyback plans. The dividend is payable to shareholders on December 12. MSFT stock goes ex-dividend– the cutoff date for new buyers of the stock to be eligible for the upcoming dividend–on November 21. At current stock prices, the new dividend has a forward yield of nearly 0.8%. Here’s a fun fact. Every year, the new quarterly dividend increase tops the year-ago dividend increase by a penny–a pattern that can be observed since November 2021. For example, the upcoming new dividend is $0.83 per share, a 8-cent increase from $0.75 per share in 2023, which is a 7-cent increase from $0.68 in 2022, and this represents a 6-cent increase from $0.62 in 2021. Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades now. This compares very favorably with the sector’s ten consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Considering that Microsoft has consistently paid and increased dividends, there isn’t much in the way of surprises that would significantly impact MSFT stock behavior—unless Microsoft were to halt or cut its dividend payments. Such a move could serve as a notable negative catalyst, though the probability of that occurring is extremely low. Currently, Microsoft distributes more than 25% of its annual earnings as dividends, which seems safe and sustainable for now. Earnings reports, company developments and competitive dynamics have a stronger sway on MSFT’s stock price. Amid the pressure to show payoffs on their huge AI capital spending, other mega techs are turning more shareholder friendly. In February, Meta joined the throngs of Apple and Microsoft, by initiating its first-ever dividend of 50 cents per share, which would be paid on a quarterly basis. After the dividend announcement on February 1, META stock closed 20% higher on February 2. Google parent Alphabet initiated a cash dividend of 20 cents per share in April and the stock gained 10% the next day. Amazon is the only major tech that does not offer a dividend yet. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the MSFT stock with an average price target of $496, which represents roughly an 18% upside from current stock price levels of around $420. MSFT stock has no Sell ratings and a few Hold ratings. Goldman Sachs (GS) maintains a Buy rating but reduced the price target on Microsoft to $500 from $515. GS expects 14% revenue growth for the first quarter, inline with the consensus, and sees EPS of $3.14, slightly above the consensus. Oppenheimer downgrades Microsoft to “Perform” From “Outperform,” citing higher-than-expected losses from Microsoft’s OpenAI investment and slower enterprise adoption of AI technology. Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to “Neutral” from “Buy,” keeping the price target unchanged at $475, citing concerns over the narrowing AI lead of Microsoft vs. rivals Google and Amazon, and MSFT’s heavy reliance on Nvidia for AI infrastructure. Jefferies is keeping its Buy rating, and price target unchanged at $550, citing the strong performance of Azure, and the promising trajectory of the M365 Copilot initiative. MSFT is 10% off its 52-week intraday high reached on July 5. After more than doubling in value over the past two years, a 10% correction in the MSFT stock is not exactly devastating. It could also be an opportunity to buy into a quality, futuristic business with the stock headed for new heights. In the near-term, there’s a very high likelihood of the Microsoft stock revisiting its highs, given an upcoming key catalyst, Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings report scheduled for release on October 30. In the longer run, AI is here to stay and is not going anywhere in a hurry. By building an evolving AI ecosystem around its products, MSFT is positioning itself as a major force within AI and cloud services. The market is in the “show me the money” mode. However, investors should remember that data centers cannot be built in a day and scaling up is a herculean task. Microsoft is definitely making progress and AI investments are already generating additional business for Microsoft, as can be seen by the strong signups for Azure AI and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Analysts expect $140 billion in incremental revenue from AI services for MSFT by 2027. Adding this to the fiscal 2024 revenue of $245 billion, Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027 based on its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 10.6x, representing 30% upside from current levels. Not to forget the long-term dividends and share buybacks that could further unlock value for investors. Microsoft stock is the top holding of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The Trust owns roughly $14.7 billion worth of Microsoft stock, representing about 30% of its $48 billion portfolio. Microsoft has been growing dividends and implementing buybacks over the last two decades. So, the recent buyback/dividend announcement is not expected to have much sway on the stock price. If the stock rallies, it could be attributed to the upcoming first-quarter earnings report slated for release on October 30. It appears that Microsoft has adequately addressed the concerns related to its capital spending in its fourth-quarter earnings call, expounding on the growing demand signals for Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilots and the variable, demand-driven nature of capex. Strong FCF generation characteristics render support to its capital spending plans. The revamp to its reporting structure will likely enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI on the overall business and ease any investor apprehensions. With growth in Xbox Content and Services revenue, gaming will likely shape up to a decent revenue stream as the global cloud gaming market gathers pace. Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027, if all goes as planned.

Atypical of technology stocks, Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades. This compares favorably with the sector’s 10 consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Microsoft has repurchased shares actively over the last two decades. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. Stock buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and offset any dilutive impact for existing shareholders from a past stock offering or stock option exercise. Buyback announcements tend to push up the stock price but not always. Have any buybacks gone wrong?Pharma giant Merck’s shares lost 15% in the month, subsequent to the unveiling of its huge $10 billion buyback program on February 22, 2000. The selloff was because investors believed that the $10 billion could have been put to better use to bolster Merck’s drug pipeline that was running dry. Microsoft pays a dividend with a forward yield of 0.8%. The yield may look small, but that is because of the strong rally in the MSFT stock over the past years. Typically, investors buy the MSFT stock for its capital appreciation potential with lesser emphasis placed on the dividend.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose again Monday in the wake of bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. The stock gained 2.4% to finish at a record closing high of $138.07 and has nearly tripled in value this year, as demand for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI) has surged. Shares are just shy of their intraday high of $140.76 set in June. Several stocks with ties to the chipmaker, including partners Arm Holdings (ARM), TSMC (TSM), and Nvidia-backed Soundhound AI (SOUN), gained Monday. The moves helped boost the tech sector, leading the S&P 500 index to a record high. In a note to clients Sunday, Citi analysts said Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market. They said they expect chipmaker’s GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) will double this year. Citi and all but one of the other 22 analysts covering Nvidia tracked by Visible Alpha held a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $152.41, implying about 10% upside from Monday’s closing price. Citi’s comments come after Goldman Sachs analysts said Friday they came away from an investor meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “with a better appreciation of the company’s competitive moat,” citing the company’s large customer base, “robust and growing” software offerings, and ability to innovate. The analysts said orders for Nvidia’s Blackwell chip are booked out with lead times extending up to a year, and that Nvidia “expects supply to remain tight for the foreseeable future.” Goldman Sachs analysts also maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, and raised their price target to $150 from $135 previously. A week ago, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's second largest company by market capitalization, behind only Apple (AAPL). With Monday's gains, Nvidia's market cap is at $3.386 trillion, compared with Apple's $3.516 trillion. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft are the only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion.

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”

Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

US stocks rose on Monday to head for fresh record highs as Nvidia stock climbed and investors prepared for more big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing."

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.
