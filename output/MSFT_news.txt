Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

Time Published: 2025-04-06T10:00:00Z

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.

Title: Apple leads Magnificent 7 stock drop amid Trump tariffs

Apple (AAPL-4.15%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN+2.61%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META+2.71%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA+3.89%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-2.73%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL+0.84%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-0.59%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-2.33%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
