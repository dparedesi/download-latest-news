Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Wednesday as the upbeat mood that followed last week's interest-rate cut showed signs of dissipating. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% on the day, receding from the all-time closing high posted in the previous session. The Dow fell 0.7%, failing to extend its streak of four consecutive record closes. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal daily gain of less than 0.1%. Shares of the financial technology company Global Payments (GPN) plunged 6.5%, posting the widest loss of any stock in the S&P 500 for the second straight day. The payment solutions provider issued underwhelming profit guidance at an investor conference earlier this week, noting it expects a year of transition in fiscal 2025. Analysts at the financial firm BTIG downgraded Global Payment stock to neutral, citing a lack of visibility in the company's growth trajectory that they believe leaves the stock in "no man's land" over the coming quarters. Amgen (AMGN) shares lost 5.5% after the drugmaker released data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of an experimental eczema treatment. Although Amgen's drug met its primary endpoint in the study, analysts question whether the results were strong enough for the treatment to merit a strong share in a market already served by Dupixent, a medication jointly developed by Amgen rivals Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN). Shares of major U.S. automakers moved lower following unfavorable comments from analysts at Morgan Stanley. The investment firm downgraded General Motors (GM) to "underweight" from "equal weight" and scaled back its view on Ford Motor (F) to "equal weight" from "overweight," citing increased competition in China and a challenging environment for U.S. consumers. GM shares were down 4.9% on Wednesday, while Ford shares slid 4.1%. Vistra (VST) shares soared 5.9%, securing the S&P 500's top daily performance after Jefferies and Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the utility stock. Analysts reacted positively to Vistra's recent acquisition of the remaining stake in its Vistra Vision subsidiary. In addition, the analysts said they believe the recent deal by fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) to power Microsoft (MSFT) data centers sets a positive precedent for other attractive agreements. Constellation Energy shares were up 3.7% on the day. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) jumped 5.1% as Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" and lifted its price target. Analysts pointed to signs of recovery in the enterprise hardware business and said they view HPE stock as one of the best ways to invest in this trend. Barclays also believes HPE can continue to increase sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) servers, make gains in the storage market, and benefit from its acquisition of Juniper Networks (JNPR) announced at the beginning of the year. Intel (INTC) shares added 3.2%, extending strong gains posted this week amid reports of a potential investment of up to $5 billion from asset management firm Apollo Global Management. Intel has also reportedly drawn interest from fellow chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM). In addition, Intel launched two new AI products on Tuesday that are central to its strategy of improving its position in the data center market.

Meanwhile, shares of Constellation Energy — a provider of nuclear power services and owner of the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — have risen 129%. Constellation — which recently signed a 10-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, according to Seeking Alpha — could be a better investment than Nvidia. Here are three reasons: One downside to consider is that analysts’ price targets fully capture Constellation’s upside, according to TipRanks. The demand for energy to operate data centers is forecast to rise as Nvidia revenue growth slows. U.S. power demand has remained roughly unchanged between 2014 and 2024, noted TheStreet. However overall power demand in data centers is projected to surge “160% by 2030,” according to a May 2024 Goldman Sachs report. To be sure, demand for AI-related hardware and software is also forecast to grow rapidly. More specifically, Bain estimates the total addressable market will increase by 40% to 55% annually, ranging between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027, according to Barron’s. While Nvidia expects to grow faster than the industry, the AI chip designer’s revenue growth is slowing down. Nvidia’s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265%, between the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, according to Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia is still growing rapidly — but at a lower rate. For instance, the AI chip designer’s revenue increased 122% in the second quarter of 2024 and the company forecasts 80% growth in the third quarter of 2024, I noted in a September post on Forbes. Constellation Energy operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, which is the preferred electricity-generating fuel for tech companies, according to Seeking Alpha. In February 2022, Constellation was spun off from utility company, Exelon. Constellation stock surged 22% on September 20 following the announcement of a 20-year deal with Microsoft to supply electricity from a $1.6 billion restart of the undamaged 835-megawatt nuclear Unit 1 of Three Mile Island — which “closed under economic pressure” in 2019, noted the Wall Street Journal. The facility’s Unit 2 was shut down in 1979 after a partial core meltdown. The resulting five days of panic “heightened awareness of nuclear plants’ potential safety problems and contributed to a loss of enthusiasm for the industry that lasted decades,” the Journal reported. The company’s latest financial report for the June 2024-ending quarter fell short of earnings and revenue expectations. However, Constellation Energy raised its earnings per share forecast for 2024. Specifically, the company’s EPS of $1.68 was four cents below the consensus estimate while the company’s $5.48 billion in revenue fell $70 million short of analysts’ consensus forecast, noted TheStreet. Constellation raised its adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2024 by 4.8% to $8 a share at the midpoint of the range — 19 cents more than the consensus, TheStreet reported. Might this boost in Constellation’s earnings growth target foreshadow expectations-beating revenue growth? Analysts lifted the company’s stock price target significantly in the wake of the company’s deal with Microsoft. Examples include: Other analysts were bullish on Constellation. While Guggenheim's Shahriar Pourreza added “the hyperscaler demand for clean megawatts is real,” Mizuho's Maheep Mandloi indicated the arrangement “points to the need for 24×7 clean energy to meet data center needs,” MarketWatch noted. To be sure, anti-nuclear sentiment — while negative at times — is arguably less pronounced than in the past. With state and federal governments urging utilities to use nuclear and renewables fuel to make electricity, Constellation has more support than before. Moreover, since it requires “neither expensive battery storage nor quick-on extra natural gas capacity equal to 110% of renewable capacity,” nuclear has advantages over renewables, reported TheStreet. It appears Wall Street still sees more upside to Nvidia stock. The 42 analysts covering the AI chip designer set an average price target of $152 — representing 24% upside, according to TipRanks, which notes Constellation’s average price target of $214 from 20 analysts makes the stock about 1% overvalued.

By: Temidayo Omoniyi | Updated: 2024-09-25 | Comments | Related: > Cloud Strategy With the ever-growing demand for data to power Large Language models (LLM), the need for streaming data is on the rise. The influx of data coming in real-time needs to be stored and made useful for prediction or descriptive use cases. Microsoft Azure has tools to achieve this use case with its many resources for data professionals. We can achieve predictive and descriptive models by introducing resources like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, and Power BI services. To better understand this article, it is advised to read the previous article titled "Data Streaming Micro-Service Architecture with Azure Technology". This article is a continuation, with a few resources being provisioned. Project Architecture Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is a cloud-based service designed to process and analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources, including applications, social media feeds, and sensors, in real-time. The following steps should be taken to provide an Azures Stream Analytics job. Step 1: Basic Settings. In your Azure portal, fill in the following information, as seen in the image below. Step 2: Storage Account (Optional). This is optional. You can add a storage account to Azure Stream Analytics by setting up your container in Azure Data Lake. This is also used to sort the ingested data in real-time in the Azure storage account. Leave all other settings at default and click Review + create to provision the Azure Stream Analytics Job. Now that we have successfully provisioned the Azure Stream Analytics Job, we need to read and analyze the data. Set Input. This refers to the source at which the data will be ingested in Azure Stream Analytics. This is obtained from Azure Event Hub. From Azure Stream Analytics, expand Job topology, then select Inputs. This should open a new window, where you click Add input and select Event Hub. In the new window, fill in the following from the image below and click Save. Note: Leave the rest at default. Test Input Connection. After successfully creating the Azure Event Hub input, test the connection by clicking the test connection icon (not shown). If all is done appropriately, you should receive a Successful connection test message. Set Output. From the Project Architecture, we plan to move aggregated data from Azure Stream Analytics to the Power BI Streaming Dataset. The next steps should be followed to achieve the output dataset: Step 1: Create Power BI Workspace. A workspace is a collaborative area containing datasets (semantic models), reports, dashboards, etc., where colleagues develop and share business intelligence reports. You can learn more about the Power BI Service workspace by reading one of our previous articles. In your Power BI Service, click on Workspaces and select New | Workspace. This should open a new window where you need to fill in the following information and click Apply. Step 2: Assign Stream Analytic Output to Power BI Workspace. Now that you have created the Power BI workspace, head back to your Azure Stream Analytics in your Stream Analytics. In your Stream Analytics, select Outputs, Add Output, and choose Power BI. In the new window, fill in the following information from the image below. Click Save. Step 3: Query Stream Data. In your Stream Analytics, click on Query. This will open a new window where you are expected to fill in the following. From the query below, you will notice the data is being read from Stream Analytics and pushed into the Power BI workspace streamyahoofinance we created earlier. If you are satisfied with the query, start the Stream Analytics job by clicking the Start job button. This automatically starts Steam Analytics and pushes the data to the Power BI Service dataset. Now that your Stream Analytics job is running, head to the Power BI Service workspace created to confirm the dataset. If you notice the dataset is not appearing, try refreshing the web browser and run again. In your Semantic model, click the 3 dots and select Create report. This will open Power BI Design Canvas. In Power BI Report Canvas, you can create simple reports of your choice. The report below might have a limited amount of insight because it was done on a weekend when most stock markets are closed for the week. Azure Machine Learning Studio is a web-based development environment for data professionals for building, testing, and deploying machine learning models on the Microsoft Azure Platform. The following steps should be taken to create Azure Machine Learning. Step 1: Basic Configuration. In your Azure Portal, search for Azure ML Studio and fill in the necessary settings. Click Review + create. Step 2: Launch Studio. After successfully provisioning Azure ML Studio, click Launch studio to start building your models. Step 3: Create Compute. Azure ML Compute refers to the computing resources you use to run your machine learning projects in Azure Machine Learning. These resources provide the processing power and memory needed to train your models, analyze data, and deploy them into production. There are different types of computing available in Azure Machine Learning. For this article, we will focus on the Compute Instance and Compute Cluster, their differences, and when best to use them. Create the Compute Instance: You can manually stop the cluster if you are not using it or set it to off after a certain inactive period. During real-world scenarios, it is best to develop your model in a test environment and then import it to Azure Machine Learning. This is for cost-saving purposes and other use cases. We will use the Jupyter Notebook to test and deploy the base to Azure ML for production use cases. The following steps will help to create a forecast model from Yahoo Finance: Step 1: Install All Necessary Libraries. Before starting the process, we need to install all necessary libraries for this project. Open your Windows terminal and paste the script below to install all the required Python Wheels. Step 2: Import All Needed Libraries. Here is a list of imported libraries needed for this project. Step 3: Get Historical Data. Note:Since we want to create a forecast model, we need historical data to train the model for prediction purposes. Data ingested from Yahoo Finance API with the Azure Function Timer trigger are in real-time; this means we don't have enough historical data to create a predictive model. Create a function that will help get the Nvidia stock data from the start date of 2010-01-01 till current date. This date range would provide enough historical data to train the model. Step 4: Visualization. Using the matplotlib library, we will create a line chart to provide a trend to understand the closing price of NVDA stock over the past couple of years. Step 5: Filter Closing Price Column. We need to create a new DataFrame with only the Close column. We plan to create a forecast model based on the Closing price column. Step 6: Standardize the Data. Scaling the data using the MinMaxScaler function is a method to slice the data to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. The MinMaxScaler is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module. Step 7: Split Data to Train. Splitting the data will help prepare the training data for the machine learning model, specifically for our case, which is a time series prediction. Step 8: Convert x_train and y_train to Numpy Array. We need to convert the training data list into a numpy array and reshape the input data into the needed format for the forecast machine learning model, which is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Step 9: Create Model. Using the LSTM model for time prediction, the following lines of code are used in creating the needed model: The following specifies the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset using the epoch number. Step 10: Split Data to Test. The code snippet below is used to split the data into both the x_test and y_test needed for the forecast model. Step 11: Create a Forecast Chart. With all the necessary information, we can create a forecast chart using the historical data. Looking at the image below, you will notice that the Predicted Trend and Validation trend are close to the train forecast. We can further improve the model's accuracy by performing hyper-parameter and model tuning. Now that we are satisfied with the model, we can import it to Azure Machine Learning. In your Azure Machine Learning Notebook tab, click the 3 dots (not shown), and then select Upload files. This will open another window. In the new window, click the + icon to upload the .ipynb file from your local machine, check all the boxes, and click Upload. With the file successfully uploaded, we can save the notebook, install all necessary libraries, and run the model. In this article, we have covered both descriptive and predictive models based on streaming data. We created a Power BI service workspace to ingest financial data from Yahoo Finance into the Power BI Stream Dataset Semantic model. The same process was repeated for the predictive model, where we created a model to forecast price prediction based on historical data. For the Forecast model, we could not use it in real-time as we needed historical data to first train the model before creating predictions. Subsequent articles on this project will be released to make further improvements to the predictive model.

All may not be going well for Bernard Arnault, who owns luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, after a whopping $54 billion wipeout. LVMH’s Arnault was once considered to be the world’s richest man, but has now fallen to 5th place. With an aim to stay in his role longer, the founder of the Paris-based behemoth pushed to raise the retirement age from 75 to 80 in 2022. “I have five members of the family working in the group, he told Bloomberg in an interview this year. “Let’s see if one of them has the capacity to take over.” The 75-year-old boss had an estimated net worth of $231 billion in March, falling to $200 billion by June, before eventually plummeting to $177 billion on Monday. While he still remains wealthier than former Microsoft (MSFT) CEOs Bill Gates ($163 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($150 billion), he now ranks lower than Elon Musk ($265 billion), Jeff Bezos ($216 billion), Mark Zuckerberg ($200 billion) and Larry Ellison ($178 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Arnault’s rank comes after the company’s stock price dipped 20%, wiping out $54 billion from his net worth. LVMH reported a fall in revenues, with its wine and spirits section being hit the hardest. According to its earnings report, Champagne sales declined 15% in the first half of the year compared to the same period a year ago. But LVMH is not alone. Analysts at Bank of America Securities (BAC) recently downgraded European luxury stocks, citing sectorial slowdown into the second half of 2024 and next year. While LVMH was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral, Germany’s Hugo Boss (BOSSY) was moved from “buy” to “underperform.” The bank analysts warn of falling demand for luxury brands among high-spending Chinese consumers. Across European luxury firms, the Bank of America analysts expect a 1% revenue decline in 2024, addressing challenges across the luxury sector. France remains a key exporter of luxury bags in China. According to a study by consultancy Asterès, LVMH’s fashion exports accounted for 4% of total French exports in 2023. But LVMH may face some headwinds. The ongoing tensions between China and Europe could also put LVMH in a tough spot. The challenge also comes at a time when there have been some leadership shifts in the organization, with all five of Arnault’s children in operational roles and four having board seats. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter.
