Title: Apple could hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025

Apple’s (AAPL+1.15%) artificial intelligence rollout could drive demand for the iPhone 16 this holiday season — and send the tech giant’s market value to a new record high. Analysts at Wedbush, led by Dan Ives, said in a recent note that the Cupertino, California-based company “is set to have a strong holiday season ahead as iPhone 16 upgrades across its installed base are trending well into Christmas.” In particular, Apple stands to sell upwards of 240 million iPhones in the 2025 fiscal year, fueled by AI-driven upgrades. The researchers said this could be “the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple’s history.” Shares of Apple closed at $254.49 each Friday, up nearly 2%. So far this year, the company’s stock has surged 37%, lifting its market capitalization to $3.85 trillion. That makes it the most valuable company in the world, followed by Nvidia (NVDA+0.39%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.94%). Wedbush maintained its $300 price target, and said Apple is on track to become the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap by early 2025. Although iPhone sales jumped 6% year-over-year in the September quarter to $46.22 billion, the company’s annual revenue grew just 1% in the 2024 fiscal year. While the company has been banking on its new AI features, known as Apple Intelligence, to supercharge sales, some analysts have warned that more substantial innovations will be needed to drive interest. Wedbush said the “naysayers” are overlooking key opportunities within the company. With 2 billion iOS devices currently in use worldwide and 1.5 billion iPhones, Wedbush believes that there are approximately 300 million iPhones that haven’t been upgraded within the past four years. That, combined with a strong services business and the massive potential for Apple users to tap into AI through their iOS devices, could give Apple the boost it’s been gearing up for, the analysts said. “We believe the success of iPhone 16 with a strong holiday season ahead over the next week will be the launching pad for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months,” they wrote.

Saylor, who was 33 at the time, says it was the most exquisite hotel room he'd ever seen, paid for by lead underwriter Merrill Lynch. The next morning, Saylor went to the floor of the Nasdaq to watch his company's stock open. He recalled seeing a note scrolling across the ticker, warning traders: "Please do not confuse MSTR with MSFT." The latter belonged to Microsoft, the software giant that had gone public 12 years earlier. MicroStrategy shares popped 76% in their debut, joining the parade of tech companies benefiting from the dot-com boom. "It was a good day," Saylor told CNBC. More than 26 years later, MicroStrategy and Microsoft were again linked together, but for an entirely different reason. In December 2024, Saylor stood before Microsoft's shareholders to try and convince them that the company, now valued at more than $3 trillion, should put some of its $78.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investment into bitcoin. "Microsoft can't afford to miss the next technology wave, and bitcoin is that wave," Saylor said in a video presentation that he released on X last week. The post has more than 3.6 million views. Saylor has gone all in on that strategy. MicroStrategy has purchased 439,000 bitcoins since mid-2020, a stockpile that's now worth about $42 billion and is the basis for the company's market cap explosion to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion when the plan was put in place. On Monday, MicroStrategy said in a filing that over about the past week it acquired another 5,262 bitcoins for roughly $561 million, at $106,662 per coin. That brings its total holdings to 444,262 bitcoins. MicroStrategy's software unit, which specializes in business intelligence, generates just more than $100 million in revenue a quarter. After zooming up in 1998 and 1999, the stock crumbled in the dot-com bust, losing almost all its value. In the decades that followed, it slowly bounced back before rocketing up due to bitcoin. Four years into its bitcoin buying spree, MicroStrategy is the world's fourth-largest holder, behind only creator Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and crypto exchange Binance. At Microsoft, the shareholder vote supported by Saylor failed by a wide margin — less than 1% of its investors voted for it. But the spectacle provided Saylor, now 59, with yet another opportunity to preach the gospel of bitcoin and tout the benefits of converting as much cash as possible into that single digital asset. It's a story that Wall Street has been gobbling up. MicroStrategy shares are up 477% this year as of Friday's close, second to only AppLovin among all U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. That follows a 346% gain in 2023. While the rally was in full force well before November of this year, Donald Trump's election victory, funded heavily by the crypto industry, propelled the stock even more. The shares have climbed 60% since the Nov. 5 election, and finally exceeded their dot-com era high from 2000 on Nov. 11. Saylor has long talked about bitcoin in an evangelical fashion and co-authored a book about it in 2022 titled "What is Money?" But his critics have gotten louder than ever of late, describing Saylor as a cult-like leader and his strategy as a "ponzi loop" that involves issuing debt and equity to buy bitcoin, watching MicroStrategy's stock price go up, and then doing more of the same. "Wash, rinse, repeat — what could possibly go wrong?" wrote Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, in a Nov. 12 post on X to his 1 million followers. Saylor, who has 3.8 million followers, addressed the growing chorus of skeptics last week in an interview with CNBC's "Money Movers." "Just like developers in Manhattan, every time Manhattan real estate goes up in value, they issue more debt to develop more real estate, that's why your buildings are so tall in New York City," Saylor said, in a clip that's been posted to X by his legion of fans. "It's been going for 350 years. I would call it an economy." Saylor is a frequent guest on CNBC, making appearances on various programs throughout the year. He also agreed to two interviews with CNBC.com, one in September and another soon after the election. The first of those chats came back at the Lotte, just a few elevator stops from the penthouse where he stayed the night before his stock hit the Nasdaq. Saylor was delivering a conference keynote at the hotel and taking meetings on the side. He wore a designer suit and an orange Hermes tie, matching bitcoin's designated color. The election was less than two months away, and crypto companies were pumping money into the Trump campaign after the Republican nominee and ex-president, who previously called bitcoin a "scam against the dollar," started guaranteeing a much more crypto-friendly administration. Two months earlier, in July, Trump delivered a keynote at the biggest bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville, Tennessee, where he promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an industry critic, and said the U.S. would become the "crypto capital of the planet" if he won. "I think the election year has inspired the crypto community to find its voice, and I think it has catalyzed a lot of enthusiasm that was latent," Saylor said in the September interview. "When Trump came out tentatively positive, that was a big boost to the industry. When he came out fully positive, that was another boost." Until this year, MicroStrategy was one of the few ways many institutions could buy bitcoin. Because MicroStrategy was an equity, investment firms didn't need any special provisions to own it. The environment changed in January, when the SEC approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing investors to buy ETFs that track the value of bitcoin. Since Trump's victory, it's all been up and to the right. Bitcoin is up about 41% and BlackRock's ETF has climbed 39%. Gensler is preparing to leave the SEC, and Trump has picked deregulation advocate and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace him. Venture capitalist David Sacks, an outspoken conservative who hosted a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco, will be the "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar," Trump announced earlier this month in a post on his Truth Social platform. "With the red sweep, bitcoin is surging up with tail winds, and the rest of the digital assets will also begin to surge," Saylor told CNBC in a phone interview, soon after the election. He said bitcoin remains the "safe trade" in the crypto space, but as a "digital assets framework" is put into place for the broader crypto market, "there'll be a surge in the entire digital assets industry," he said. "Taxes are coming down. All the rhetoric about unrealized capital gains taxes and wealth taxes is off the table," Saylor said. "All of the hostility from the regulators to banks touching bitcoin" also goes away, he added. MicroStrategy has gotten even more aggressive with its bitcoin purchases. Saylor said in a post on Dec. 16, that over a six-day stretch starting Dec. 9, his company had acquired 15,350 bitcoins for $1.5 billion. So far this year, MicroStrategy has acquired over 255,000 bitcoins, with about two-thirds of those purchases occurring since Nov. 11. "We were going to do it regardless," Saylor said, referring to the election results. "But what was a headwind has become a tail wind." A week before the election, MicroStrategy announced in its quarterly earnings release a plan to raise $42 billion over three years. That included a stock sale of up to $21 billion through financial firms including TD Securities and Barclays, opening up that much more liquidity for bitcoin purchases. Saylor told CNBC it was "probably the single most important earnings call in the history of the company." No amount of ownership is too much for Saylor, who predicted in September that bitcoin could hit $13 million by 2045, which would equal 29% growth annually. "We'll just keep buying the top forever," he said in the same TV interview where he compared bitcoin to New York real estate. "Every day is a good day to buy bitcoin. We look at it as cyber-Manhattan." Saylor talks glowingly about bitcoin as the foundation of a new digital economy that will only get bigger. But even since his bitcoin strategy got underway in 2020, there have been pockets of severe pain for investors — the stock lost 74% of its value in 2022 before soaring the past two years. Still, he's advising companies to mimic his strategy. Microsoft didn't listen, but Saylor said there are plenty of "zombie companies," with core businesses that aren't going anywhere that could make better use of their cash. "The traditional advice would be, you do a transformational acquisition, you find that you need a merger partner. You're dead in the water. Go find somebody to merge with," Saylor said at the Lotte in September. "Bitcoin is the universal merger partner, right? The real appeal of digital capital is you can fix any company."

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/22/retire-on-460k-in-2025-with-this-simple-7-fund-portfolio/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Title: Nvidia stock rebounds after broad market rout as analysts stay bullish on outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity.
