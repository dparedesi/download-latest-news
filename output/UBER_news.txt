The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. by Andrew J. Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. “I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???” But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems. Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.) What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles. A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.) The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen. Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs. Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.” Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.” But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.

March 11, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, Global Chief Economist for BCG, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have an extra special guest, really fascinating conversation with Philip Carlson Lesak. He’s got a really interesting background, chief Economist at Sanford Bernstein. Worked at the OECD, began at McKinsey, ended up as global chief economist for the Boston Consultant Group Group, and really approaches economic analysis from a very different perspective critical of the industry’s over-reliance on models which have proven themselves to be not great predictors of what happens next, especially when the future in any way differs from the past. And so when we have things like the.com implosion, or especially internal to the market, the financial crisis of oh 8, 0 9, and even COVID models just don’t give you a, a good assessment. And he describes how he reached this conclusion in his book, shocks, crises, and False Alarms, how to assess true macroeconomic risk. He calls out a lot of people who get things wrong, especially the doomsayers who not only have been forecasting recessions incorrectly for, I don’t know, the better part of 15 years, most especially since CO. But their models just simply don’t allow them to understanding a dynamic changing global, interconnected economy. I, I thought the book was fascinating, and I thought our conversation was fascinating, and I know you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with the Boston Consulting Groups, Philip Carlson Lesak. Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: Thank you for having me. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s start with a little bit, I wanna talk about the book, but before we get to that, let’s talk a little bit about your background, which is kind of fascinating for an American, you get a bachelor’s at Oxford, a PhD at the London School of Economics. Was becoming an economist, always the career plan. Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: Well, let me correct you right there. I’m not American. I was born in Switzerland. I grew up there, but in a, in a number of other countries as well. So Barry Ritholtz: You have sort of an American accent. How long have you been here? I spent a lot of time here, Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: Yeah. Early on as well in my youth. And so growing up in, in different places, I always compared and contrasted what I saw. So I developed an interest in, in economics. So when it came to going to college, studying economics was a very natural choice. Barry Ritholtz: Where, where did you grow up in Switzerland, Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: Zurich. I was born there Barry Ritholtz: Okay. I, I recently visited both Geneva and Lake Geneva up, and it’s just spectacular. What a beautiful part of the world. It is. It really, really impressive. So first job out of school, McKinsey, is that right? That’s right. And and what was that experience like? Well, Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: I studied economics at LSC, actually not at Oxford. I did my PhD at Oxford, so the other way around, and that was at the turn of the century. Let me take a step back. It was the turn of the century. And I emphasized that because that was peak economics. So, you know, the, the hubris and the arrogance of the economics profession was at its peak. And, you know, we’re still seven, eight years out from the global financial crisis, which was a big humbling moment for the profession. So everything was very model driven theory, Quin, econometrics and all that. So, you know, I, I didn’t feel comfortable even then as an undergraduate, then as a graduate student, I branched out, I started reading a lot more, you know, going to political theory, finance history, much broader, building a mosaic of knowledge and, and also methods and, and approaches, frameworks. And so at the end of, of my graduate studies with a PhD, that’s when I landed in, in, in consulting at McKinsey. And the work was very different. So very nitty gritty, right? You go deep into corporations, other organizations, you do very, very granular work. So coming with this big picture view of the world and analyzing and going into this super nano, micro part of, of business was, was a big change. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s stay with the concept of peak economist. Yeah. I think it was Paul Krugman who did the saltwater versus freshwater comparison, which was essentially the economists along the coast seemed to have a very different model and very different approach to doing macro versus people more inland, at least in the us. Does that sort of dichotomy resonate with you? How do you, how do you think about that? Well, Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: I generally view all of of mainstream economics as, as two model based master model mentality in the book, sort of this belief that economics is a bit like a natural science and we can pass it off as a natural science. That belief is still still very much alive. And so physics envy, which has long been identified as the problem of the discipline, still reigns supreme in my view. And the book is really partly a repudiation of that. So my co-author and I, we take master model mentality to task in the book. And we think economics deserves a much more eclectic approach, drawing on many more disciplines than, than just sort of standards Economics Barry Ritholtz: What are your thoughts on the impact of behavioral economics that really took apart the homo economists that was front and center of classical economics and showed, Hey, people aren’t rational profit maximizing actors. They’re emotional and flawed and human Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: I think that is very, very interesting. It’s very valuable that we have that strand of research and economics, but it’s more in the micro side. It’s not really macro predominantly. And so I I firmly live in a global macro space where I think we still have very commoditized economics. You know, it’s, it’s all about a set of forecasts. People are still wedded to their models. It’s very much point forecast driven. And I think what we need is much more narrative based, judgment based, more eclectic approaches to reading the landscape. And that’s what the book is really, really about. Barry Ritholtz: So we’re, we’re gonna talk more about how poorly economists have done as forecasters over the past few decades. And you, you have numerous, numerous examples, but let’s stay with your early career. You’re, you’re going deep at McKinsey into the granularity of corporate behavior, then you very much a, a sea change alliance. Bernstein or Sanford Bernstein, you become chief economist. How different is it applying those wares on Wall Street in an investment environment versus the corporate world in a more, you know, execution basis? Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: You know, the, the switch to the sell side was, was really good for me. There was something I, I’d been missing in my skillset. I’d done a lot of deep thinking, writing, researching. I’d done the, the more microeconomics I, I learned more about the corporate world, but I hadn’t been exposed to the finance angle of it as much. I hadn’t talked to the buy side at all really before. And being at Sanford Bernstein, a firm with a storied history and, and equity research really, and swimming in this pool of, of really great equity analysts, just taught me a lot of things, not least how to frame research angles, how to be quick with research notes, how to get the thoughts out. And then the constant exposure to investors on the buy side really, really helped me sharpen my research skills. So that was almost like a, a, a missing piece in my recipe. It really unlocked something for me, and I learned a lot there and, and I had a really good time doing that work publishing, you know, many, many research reports over those years and often going very, very deep, often going very historical in the approach. So Bernstein is a firm that, that very much appreciates lateral thinking, differentiated approaches out there kind of ideas. And so I, I ran wild for a while just doing, doing work that I don’t think I would’ve done anywhere else. So 00:08:41 [Speaker Changed] You started a consultant, you briefly, at A NGO, at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and OECD, I don’t even know, development is, I guess the last date. Yep. You’re on the sell side. So you, you see the universe of career options as an economist. What brought you back to the Boston Consulting Group? 00:09:03 [Speaker Changed] So I had a history with BCG already, and, and I was well connected there and at some point I was approached if I’d like to come back and do the same kind of work I was doing on the sell side. But at, at B-C-G-B-C-G is a really great platform because not only is it deeply ingrained in the, in the corporate world, so you know, the access to boardrooms is, is very wide. You, you get to meet a lot of interesting executives and, and the prevalence they’re grappling with, but you also still have access into the institutional investor world who are also clients. So you really get both sides of the landscape and they, they’re really different, right? On the buy side, it’s mostly a, a, a look at firms outside in, they’re outside of what’s happening in the boardrooms. They’re trying to decode it from the outside. Being a consultant, working and talking with ’em, you’re much closer to what’s actually happening in their deliberations, the problems they’re facing, the questions they’re trying to answer. So to me, that platform is very attractive because it’s, it’s very versatile. It’s, it’s never gets boring. And I’ve, I’ve had a good run the last five years doing my work on that BCG platform. 00:10:14 [Speaker Changed] So I have no expertise in the consulting world, but I kind of hear people lump all the consultants together, McKinsey, B, C, G, all these different firms. I get the sense from speaking to various people that that’s kind of inaccurate that BCG is not McKinsey, they’re very different organizations. What’s your experience been? 00:10:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean they, they, they have different cultures for sure. They certainly vie for the same business, the three that you mentioned. So, so you, you constantly bump into those other two competitors. If you’re at any one of those three firms, I would think 00:10:48 [Speaker Changed] The third being 00:10:50 [Speaker Changed] Bain, I think you may Okay, yep. Be McKinsey, BCG, Bain, those three, there are others, but those are the core strategy consultants, if you will. And, you know, I would think the type of work that is done is obviously very similar to vying for the same business, but culturally it’s different. And, you know, they’re, they’re slightly different sizes. These three firms. B, CG today is about 12 billion in, in revenues annually. And we have about, I think 60, 70 offices and, and, no, sorry, well, well over a hundred offices in 60 countries, I think is the right metric here. Right. And you know, it’s, it’s, it’s a space that is, is very, very competitive, but that, that keeps everyone on their toes. 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] I, I would imagine. So let’s, let’s talk a advising companies and advising executives. You talk about explaining economic uncertainty and as we’ll get into in the book why there is this risk aversion and these fears of crises that never seem to come around. How do you approach advising executives on navigating all this? It seems like there’s always this fear of a disaster and lately it hasn’t really showed up. 00:12:11 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so a lot of what I do in conversations with executives is to uns skew, if you will, some of the perceptions they pick up in the press, in public discourse, which is reliably dialed down to the, to the sort of do mongering side of things, right? That is really true. It’s not just lately, since you mentioned it, sort of the inevitable recession that never, that never came, we’re really at the end of a string of such false alarms. You know, when covid hit, it was very common to predict a depression. Not just a recession, but a depression was very conventional wisdom in 2020 that this would take many years to recover. Then when interest rates rose, it was, it was fashionable to predict an emerging market, a cascade of, of defaults then, then of course when inflation spiked, it was cast as a 00:13:03 [Speaker Changed] Hyperinflation, 00:13:04 [Speaker Changed] Hyperinflation, structural inflation regime, break the 1970s, all that stuff that, that clearly even then I think was, was very clearly not, not what was playing out. And then the inevitable recession is really just the most recent in a string of false alarms. So often what I do is, is to meet people where they are. They, they pick up doomsday narratives because they’re very prevalent in public discourse. And we often go back to basics and ask, well, how does the system work? And importantly, what would it take for these big bad outcomes to, to happen? It’s not that they can’t happen, they’re part of a risk distribution, but very often we take these risks and public discourse that are the edges of the risk distribution, tail 00:13:46 [Speaker Changed] Risks, 00:13:46 [Speaker Changed] Tail risks, and we pretend that they’re in the middle of the distribution. Right? If you go through financial news, if you go to financial TV kind of conversations, you, you often get the impression that these risks, which are genuine risks are real. They’re part of the distribution, but you get the impression that they’re really the center of everything we should be watching. And so often, 00:14:07 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So this leads to an obvious question. Whenever I have an author in, I often ask what inspired them to write their book? It’s pretty clear what inspired you. It seems like it, it got to the point where, hey, everybody is freaking out about things that are either not happening or just so low probability events that they’re not contextualizing it well, what actually was the aha moment that said, I gotta put all this down in a book and instead of repeating myself over and over here, read this and it’ll it’ll explain why you’re fearing all the wrong things. 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It was the, it was the accumulation of, of situations where my co-author Paul Schwartz and I felt we had a pretty good access to this topic. We, we kind of got that one right, not because we were using models and sophisticated analysis, but we, we looked at it from a narrative driven perspective. We asked the right questions about what does it take to get to that really bad structural situation. And so we wanted to wrap that into a coherent story of how we think about economics. Not because we can get it right every single time. Even if you use a more eclectic approach to economics, you will get things wrong, but I think you hit rate can improve. And that was the motivation to, to write that all down in the book and, and yeah, that, that’s how this came about. 00:15:35 [Speaker Changed] So first, let, let’s just start out generally, you, you described the book as calling out pervasive dooming in public discourse about the economy and demonstrating how to navigate real financial and global risks more productively. Explain. So 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] Over the last few years, call it, since the, since the Covid pandemic, we’ve had a string of, of false alarms, as I would call ’em, right out the gate in 2020, we were told this will be a greater depression, maybe as bad as the 1930s. Worse in 2008, that wasn’t the case at all. Then we had an inflation spike that was spun into an inflation regime break forever, inflation hyperinflation that didn’t pan out. Then we had rising interest rates and that was spun into a doomsday story of emerging markets cascade of, of defaults. And then we had the, the story of an inevitable recession that we’re still waiting for, right? So we have across the board a lot of negativity across the board. We have a lot of doom saying public discourse is pervasive in that regard. The story always skew to the downside. And what the book does it, it provides a framework to think about this differently, more productively. And it does so across real economy risks, think recession, but also sort of longer term growth. It does so in the financial economy, think about stimulus and the effectiveness of stimulus, interest rates, inflation bubbles, that type of stuff. And it does so across the, the global space, the institutions that govern trade, et cetera. 00:17:11 [Speaker Changed] So you combine data analysis with both narrative storytelling and judgment over traditional macroeconomic models. Explain what led you to this way to contextualize what’s going on in the real world economy. 00:17:29 [Speaker Changed] So I, I, my path for economics was fairly eclectic. I started out studying economics in a traditional theoretical macroeconomic econometric sense. And then I went into studying much broader adjacent fields that, that are relevant to economics, finance, history, political theory, political economy, et cetera. Then I had different experiences in my career just just putting together different views of how to approach these problems. And over time and working on the sell side, as we discussed, I put all these together. And so it is just the insight that the models will not deliver. You cannot accurately forecast the economy. Economists shouldn’t feel so ashamed about that. It’s not like natural scientists are always doing better, think about epidemiologists. They also struggle to accurately forecast covid deaths, for example. So, you know, the, the whole physics envy and the whole inferiority complex that often besets the, the economics profession is misplaced in, in my view, we should embrace the uncertainty that prevents us from making precise point forecast. And we should live with that uncertainty, embrace the eclectic nature of what we’re trying to solve. It isn’t just about economics and policy, it’s about myriad other things that play into this. And when we do that and do it rationally, I think often we we’re gonna land in, in, in better, better predictions. 00:18:55 [Speaker Changed] You know, it’s funny about the physics envy. Richard Feynman once said, imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings. Feelings, yeah. Right. So it, it’s, it’s not a pure natural world. You have human behavior getting in the way. And, and you know, one of the quotes from the book, doom Cells, hasn’t that always been the case? That it appeals not only to our fear of existential threats from an evolution perspective, but just generally speaking, good news is sort of sneaks by and bad news gets our attention. 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s the, the clicks and, and the eyeballs that we’re, that we’re trying to attract in the, in the news business model. And that, that gives you the slant to the downside. I think it’s, it’s particularly pronounced these days, 00:19:49 [Speaker Changed] Social media and the rest, 00:19:51 [Speaker Changed] That’s part of it. But it’s also the case that when you think about the last 40 years or so, there was a window that we call good macro in the book. So a lot of macroeconomic variables, a lot of macroeconomic context was benign and was a tailwind, you know, for executives, but certainly for investors. So in the real economy cycles grew longer, volatility came down, like recessions were, were less frequent. The financial economy inflation structurally decline, pulling down interest rates with it in the, in the global realm, you had, you know, institutional growth and, and where we’re aligning value chains and, and all that really was a tailwind to executives and investors. And more recently, not just COVID, you can, you can go back to 2008. It’s sort of a growing crescendo of, of new noise and new disturbances. I think that good macro window is, is challenged, right? 00:20:44 We had a lot of generations, we had a lot of shocks, all the whiplash there. And so for executives, when it used to be possible to ignore the macro world or take it for granted, it’s now moved into the boardroom. N now you need to have a view on what these things mean for your business and you kind of need to do that almost ongoingly. Mm. So that has changed and because there’s more gyrations, there’s more whiplash, I think that has dialed up all the angst and it has dialed up the doom saying, and the string of false alarms that I went through earlier in my mind is, is is pretty dense. It’s, it’s, you know, every year we had a new doomsday narrative and, and every single year it, it just didn’t pan out that way. 00:21:23 [Speaker Changed] You know, there, there was a, I’m trying to remember which economists wrote this up at, at one point in history, your whole world was your local region and what happened globally or what happens across the ocean was not relevant. Now it doesn’t matter what corner of the earth you’re hiding in, the global macro world is knocking on your door regardless. How significant is that to both, to both coming up with a better macroeconomic framework and all of these false crises and fears that seem to be never ending? Yeah, 00:22:02 [Speaker Changed] I think the greater in interconnectedness and the, the real time aspect of economics and the pass through of, of influences and, and in, in, in often just hours transmitted often through financial markets, that just adds to that. It’s, it never, it never stops. It never takes a break. You know, you, you go to sleep with with sort of the latest data, you wake up with the latest data, right? I mean it’s sort of constant in that regard and I think that certainly feeds into that sense of heightened risk and, and crisis. 00:22:33 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about some shocks. Over the past quarter century. We had, and this is really just less global than US focused, but obviously international ramifications. We had the dotcom implosion in 2000. We had the September 11th attacks in oh one. Not long after that. We had the great financial crisis. We had COID in between, we had a couple of market events. The flash crash V again, I don’t know if you really consider those true economic shocks, but certainly.com nine 11 GFC and Covid were huge. Is this, have we been through more than the usual number of shocks or does it just seem that way recently? 00:23:19 [Speaker Changed] Well, we’ve always had shocks. I think 2008 stands out among the ones you mentioned because that’s where the US economy actually came close to the precipice of this could be a structural depression. Without the intervention, without the stimulus that was deployed at the time, this could have gone a lot worse. Covid in some sense was a replay of that risk, but, but action was more swift and more decisive. So it seems like we’ll learn something there 00:23:44 [Speaker Changed] And much more fiscal as opposed to the financial crisis, which was primarily a monetary response. And we ended up with two very different years that followed address that if you would. 00:23:57 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I think in 2008 you’ll remember tarp tarp was, was a, what now looks like a poultry sum of 700 billion. And it got voted down in Congress. Right, right. So 00:24:08 [Speaker Changed] I remember that week in October. Yeah. And the market seized so aggressively in the stock market sold off that it was voted down on a Monday by Friday it passed overwhelmingly. 00:24:19 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. And I think this is one of the big themes that we emphasize in the book Stimulus comes down to the willingness of politicians to act and the ability to act ability is more about financial markets, will bond markets, finance, this, this kind of action, which they do in times of crisis. But the willingness has to be there to act. And in times of crisis, the willingness to act usually arises. Partisanship is, is put aside. Politicians come together. They, they, they act to, you know, when the house is on fire, you, you, you will step up and and do something about it. And I think in 2020 that was in display and there was a learning curve from the more timid approach in 2008 and then in perhaps it was overdone in 2020 and the, and the following years. But certainly the, the risk was perceived perhaps we’re doing too little, so let’s rather go large and backstop the system. 00:25:11 [Speaker Changed] My favorite story from the 2020 Cares Act was a week before the country was shut down, Congress couldn’t agree on renaming a library in DC ’cause it was just along partisan lines. Everything got tabled then the world shut down. And the largest fiscal stimulus since World War ii, at least as a percentage of GDP flew through the House and Senate and was signed by CARES Act one was President Trump Cares Act. TRU two was President Trump Cares. Act three was President Biden. Did we learn something from the financial crisis about the lack of fiscal stimulus and maybe the pendulum swung too far the other way? What, what’s your takeaway from that? 00:25:58 [Speaker Changed] No, for sure. Look, I I think two crises were very different. You had in 2008 damage balance sheets, not just in the banking system, but households, their balance sheets had to be repaired. Households had to dig themselves outta that hole, had to rebuild our wealth. And that that would’ve called for more intervention than, than what we got in 2008. In 2020, I think policy makers, politicians, they had internalized that learning. So they went extra large on the fiscal side. And that hole that covid created was basically filled with, with fiscal stimulus as you know, it’s widely believed and accepted that this was extremely big, too much perhaps. And so we had an overshoot in, in certain consumption areas, particularly in the, in the good space, there was an overshoot and, and consumption. It, it, it pushed up demand it, it, it together with supply crunches, it pushed up inflation in an idiosyncratic and more tactical, cyclical way. Not structural, but, but tactical way. And so I think yes, policy makers did learn something and they were risk averse, so they went extra large. 00:27:08 [Speaker Changed] So you said the financial crisis clearly a shock. The other things not as much as a shock. And we’ve had plenty of false alarms. How do you define what a true shock or crises is and what do you put in the category of false alarms or things that are genuine, but just don’t rise to the level A as described? Yeah. 00:27:31 [Speaker Changed] There, there are two things to consider. One is sort of the news cycle level. We have a constant doom saying about suppose things that could lead to recession or otherwise downgrade the economy. You know, just the last few years we, we went numerous, you know, for example, consumers were supposed to run outta cash and consumers were not gonna keep up their spending. We had lots of false alarms about the labor market even last summer, right? We had last summer in August, there was a somewhat of a panic because supposedly the labor market was gonna be very soft and, and very weak. So we have these new cycle false alarms stories that, that often are rooted in a data point that is noteworthy, that is interesting, that does signify risk. But we extrapolating from the data point to conclusions that don’t hold up. That is one category of false alarms. 00:28:21 The other category is where you have real crises, but the question is, are they gonna have structural impact? Are they gonna have a long-term impact on the economy? Are they gonna downgrade the economy’s capacity? So 2008 does qualify, 2008 left an indelible mark on the US economy, but 2020 didn’t in terms of performance and output. We’ve regained the output to trend output that we were on the path we’re traveling on pre covid. We’ve, we’ve come back to that trend, output path. It has not left the kind of permanent mark on economic performance that you saw after 2008. Huh. So in that sense, we need to differentiate between what is a likely shock that that will pass and that we can fix versus what is something that changes the structural composition, structural setup of the economy, durably. Those are two very different types of, of, of situations 00:29:14 [Speaker Changed] That, that sounds like a usable framework for distinguishing between real crises. And do I call it media alarmism or, you know, I don’t, everybody’s blaming the media these days, especially with this administration, but there has been a fairly relentless negativity, especially in social media. What’s the best framework for, you know, separating the wheat from the chaff? 00:29:41 [Speaker Changed] Well, typically when we see kneejerk reactions and doomsday stories, they’re, they’re taking a data point and then they’re extrapolating usually on the basis of a model. So, I mean, think about the inevitable recession. Even Larry Summers, people like that, they came out and said, look, to bring down wage growth to bring down inflation, you need, I don’t know, five years of unemployment at this and that level. Why? Because 00:30:06 [Speaker Changed] Right, he threw out 10%, 00:30:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, 10% for one year, right? Or 5% for five years, right? So he had different configurations, but they were all based on basically the Phillips curve. This was all a Phillips curve take on the economy, which is, 00:30:18 [Speaker Changed] Which was a great model 50 years ago, wasn’t it? 00:30:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It, it described the UK and certain other countries empirically quite well. It wasn’t ever really a model and a theory. It was more of a description of empirical facts. But certainly it was useful for a window. It’s still useful as, as, as a, as a instrument to think about dynamics, right? But it was basically used as, as the truth. You know, there’s an input and there’s an output. And my model gives me the truth if I give it certain inputs. And then, well, what happens? We’re extrapolating data points often outside the range of empirical facts. The models are only trained on historical facts. You know, you can’t make up data points to train your model. So when a crisis hits likely, you get data points that were not empirically known in the past. So what does the model do? It extrapolates outside, it’s it’s historical empirical range. 00:31:12 And then you get these kind of point forecast that just don’t, don’t work. I mean, case in point in 2008, unemployment goes up to around 10%, right? And it takes almost the whole 2010s a full decade almost to bring down this very high unemployment rate. So in covid, when unemployment shoots up to 14%, what does the model do? It says, well, if it takes, you know, a decade to bring down 10% unemployment, it will take even longer to bring down 14% of unemployment. Right? And that is exactly this kind of, of, of limitation of the model based approach. Empirically, you never had 14% unemployment, right? So if the model extrapolates from past data points, it’s gonna go off the tracks. And that’s exactly what happened in that instance. 00:31:54 [Speaker Changed] So, so the underlying flaw built into most models is that the future will look like the past. And as we’ve learned, that often is not the case. 00:32:05 [Speaker Changed] It’s always idiosyncratic. Look, the, the US economy, since the second World war has only seen a dozen recessions. Now each of those recessions is totally idiosyncratic. And even, even if they had a lot of commonalities, 12 is not a sample size that a natural scientist would consider large enough to, to build sort of an empirical model around, right? Each of these crises or each of these recessions was idiosyncratic. And the idiosyncrasy demands much more than a simple model or even a sophisticated model. It demands the eclectic view across many, many drivers. And that comes down to judgment. There isn’t, there isn’t an output in an Excel sheet or a Python model or anything. In the end, it comes down to human judgment. And, and I think that that is something we lose sight of way too often. 00:32:51 [Speaker Changed] You very much strike me as a fan of Professor George Box. All models are wrong, but some are useful. Tell us a little bit about how models can be useful. 00:33:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, there are always a good starting point. Even the Phillips curve has, has a lot of validity to think about what might be happening. There are always this sketch of, of reality. But the moment we’re translating that from, you know, a sketch and a map into something that is hardwired in a quant quantified model, and the moment we then expect that the output will resemble anything like the truth, we’re, we’re sort of denying the reality of this. It, it just doesn’t work that way. Look, I’m not the first person to make that point. In fact, you know, Hayek, Kanes fund MEUs, they’ve long basically trashed economics for saying like, you’re too gullible and you’re too naive, right? About the constant nature of these variables. They, they’ve long pointed out that you don’t have this, this what the national sciences provide, which is stability in all these relations of variables. 00:33:58 You don’t have that in economics. And there’s a, there’s a, an anecdote that we pick up in the book. When Hayek receives the Nobel Prize in 1974, he actually uses his acceptance speech, or I think it was a dinner speech he gave right after being awarded the, the prize. He uses that speech to say, look, you shouldn’t do this prize in economics. You should, you should have never, you should have never done the Nobel Prize in economics. But if you must have this prize, at least ask the recipients to swear an oath of humility. Because unlike physicists and, and in chemistry and other natural sciences, economists have a big microphone, right? Policy makers listen to them, politicians listen, public listens to them, but they don’t have that certainty of analysis. They don’t have that stability in their model. So they’re gonna go off the tracks all the time. So at least ask them to be humble about what they’re doing. And I think that that is a good reminder of the long history of recognizing the limits of model-based approaches through the eyes of some of the leading, leading thinkers in this, in the space. 00:34:59 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about a lot of the false alarms and, and folk crises. So many economists got 2022, wrong, 20 23, 20 24, they were expecting a recession, it never showed up. Why is that? 00:35:19 [Speaker Changed] It starts with the master model mentality that we call out in the book where we place too much trust in models. So the Phillips curve was essentially used by many forecasters and 00:35:31 [Speaker Changed] Commentators define, define the Phillips curve for the lay reader who may not be familiar. Yeah. 00:35:34 [Speaker Changed] Phillips curve is, is as an, as an old theory going back middle of the last century describing the relationship between wage growth and, and unemployment. So the idea is that you trade off the two variables and that led commentators like Larry Summers to say, to bring inflation under control, you would need either many years of high unemployment or a sharp recession, 10% unemployment for a year to reset the inflation picture. In other words, in layperson’s terms, a soft landing isn impossible. Right? And this is what fit into the inevitable recession. That was the dominant received wisdom the last few years. Now, you know, these things are good starting points. They have validity historically and a lot of empirical data, but in the end it’s idiosyncratic, it’s very idiosyncratic constellation of drivers and risks. And so it was in the last few years. So let’s, let’s look at that for a moment. 00:36:25 One of these master models was also interest rate sensitivity, right? We, we think interest rates go up and that eases into disposable incomes for households, right? But in reality, mortgages in the us, unlike in Canada, mortgages are long term, didn’t actually take a big bite outta disposable income. Mostly fixed rate, exactly. Very long term fixed rate low. And most of them were done at low rates because we had low rates for a long time. Contrast that with the flexible contracts and mortgages in, in Canada where they lost a lot of disposable income. That wasn’t the case here. Same thing about interest rate sensitivity in the corporate sector. You know, the textbook tells you interest rates go up and investment will fall. But does it, you know, when you do the empirical analysis for whatever window, you’ll see a very flimsy correlation between interest rates and CapEx firms invest when they have a narrative to do so when they see a return on the investment, and if they believe the investment is beneficial to them, they’ll do it. 00:37:21 Whether the interest rate is two, three or 4%, and just look at what happened in the last few years. You had a lot of narrative and belief in worth worthwhile investments, data centers, software. So with or without higher interest rates, firms are going to do that. Particularly also because a lot of our investment has shifted away from, you know, fixed structures, physical investment to intellectual property, software type of investment, which has a much higher rate of depreciation. So a bridge or or road will be good for 30, 40 years, but software is maybe three or four years. So you constantly have to invest just to stand still, just to keep the stock of investment in this space, to keep it steady. You constantly have to run faster just to, to maintain that. And so there is, there was a lot of idiosyncratic drivers that led, that led to, to very different outcomes from what was predicted from a model based Phillips car type approach to, to reading that, that context. 00:38:20 [Speaker Changed] So a lot of highly regarded economists like Larry Summers kind of reminded me of the Paul Graham quote, all experts are experts in the way the world used to be. And we’re, we’re seeing a lot of that in that. So not only did people get the recession calls wrong for the past couple of years, what have we had two months of recessions in the past 15 years are, are we in a post-recession economy? Now, 00:38:49 [Speaker Changed] You can still get recessions, but I think we’ve, we’ve become better at fighting them. So this is the topic of stimulus. There, there are three different types of, there are two different types of stimulus that we describe in the book, across three chapters. And we differentiate between what we call tactical stimulus, which is just to smooth the cycle, accelerate growth in between recessions, maybe de-risk the cycle when necessary versus existential stimulus, which is when, when policymakers politicians step in, when the economy’s truly at risk of a structural break, those two types of stimulus, they’re, they’re evolving differently. I think the tactical kind is more challenged going forward. It was very easy when inflation was below target. It was very easy when interest rates were very, very low, there was little cost to the fed put you could do that. There wasn’t sort of an inflation risk as associated with it. That’s different now. And I think they will remain different now that we’re, we’re skewed to the upside. And in terms of inflation, we’re interest rates are, are likely to be higher for much longer. But the existential type of stimulus, the ability to step up when it’s needed, I think that is still very strong. And if you have another shock or a crisis or a recession, I think we’ll be able to deploy stimulus effectively still. So 00:40:03 [Speaker Changed] We said earlier, all recessions are not homogeneous, they’re all idiosyncratic and unique. But one of the things you mentioned in the book that kind of intrigued me, we shouldn’t conflate recession intensity and recovery. Explain what that means. 00:40:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. When covid hit, we had extreme data prints unemployment is, is, is sort of the exhibit A of the story. Unemployment went to 10% in 2008, but it went to 14% in 2020, right? So the intensity, the, the sudden collapse of activity was much more pronounced in covid than it was in 2008. GDP 00:40:42 [Speaker Changed] Also much worse during the first few months of covid. Then g 00:40:46 [Speaker Changed] All variables. And we have a chart early in the book that shows the fifth to 90th percentile of, of historical experience of these variables. And covid is like far outside that historical range. So you get data prints that you’re not used to, that the models don’t know. The models were trained on, on data points that were simply not experienced until they happened in Covid. Now all of that fed into extreme intensity was equated with this will be a very long and difficult recovery, why the 10% unemployment rate led to many years of, of recovery in the 2010s, right? So now if the unemployment rate is even higher, it’s gonna take even longer to work it down to a level that is, that is, you know, a good economy again. But that wasn’t, that wasn’t the case. 2020 wasn’t about a balance sheet recession, it wasn’t about banks repairing their balance sheets. It wasn’t about households repairing the balance sheet. We, we took care of that with stimulus and therefore the ability to recover was much faster, much stronger. There were other idiosyncratic factors. Essentially what was underestimated was the, the ability to adapt of society. You know, societies found, found ways to, to work around the virus. The, the pathway to a vaccine was faster. So there were a lot of things that were underestimated. 00:41:59 [Speaker Changed] You know, it kind of reminds me of the Y 2K fear that when there’s a little bit of a fear of panic, the expected crisis may not show up because we’re taking steps to avoid it. We don’t know what was Y two KA false alarm or did the fear lead us to make sufficient changes to avoid problems? I, I honestly can’t answer that question. I, I’m wondering how you look at crises in terms of do some of the fear mongering and some of the, you know, media absolute extremism lead to government action that prevents the worst case scenario from happening. 00:42:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s possible that it shapes the perception of, of policy makers and politicians, but I think the realities on the ground, you know, the variables that are visible and measurable, the unemployment rate, GDP growth, you know, imports, exports, all of that was under pressure. I think that is more telling for those who, who take decisions than what public discourse does. Is public discourse, particularly fearful in a lot of angst, pervades how we think about the economy? Does that spur action? Maybe that, that’s part of it. So we, we don’t know, as you rightly say, what is, what is what would’ve been in a counterfactual world. But essentially when the economy is genuinely in trouble, I think the, the willingness to act on the stimulus side is very strong. 00:43:29 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about some of those metrics. You, you have a image in the book scanning the recession barcode. So tell us about that and the history of us recessions, which seem to have been more frequent and more intense. You go back a century, they were depressions, not even recessions. Tell us about how this has changed over the past, I don’t know, couple of hundred years. 00:43:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so if you do a very long run chart for recessions in the US economy and you shade each recession as a bar, what you get is a barcode of image that looks a bit like a barcode, but it thins out as you move to the right. So you had recessions very frequently a hundred years ago and, and further back the economy was constantly in recession, essentially half the time it was in recession. Banking 00:44:21 [Speaker Changed] Panics all the time. Yeah. 00:44:22 [Speaker Changed] But also real economy, you know, the economy was very agrarian, A bad harvest could drag down performance of the economy. So, so there were a lot of shocks, but yes, yes, there were also banking crises and, and things like that. And what we identify in the book is a recession risk framework. We say, look, all recessions come in one of three flavors. They’re either real economy recessions, which is when investment and consumption drop abruptly and pull GDP growth down. So that’s the real economy type of recession. The second is a policy error. When policy makers get it wrong, they raise interest rates too fast or too high, which only you ever know exposed whether it was the right thing to do. So it’s a very tricky thing to do. And the third type of recession is, is the most pernicious kind. It’s a financial recession when something blows up in the financial system like, like 2008. 00:45:09 And what we’re showing in, in, in this chapter of the book. Over the long run, the composition of these two drivers has changed over the last 40 years. The real economy recessions, they really took a backseat because the economy calmed down. The volatility come down, services play a bigger role in the economy today. So the less volatile than, than physical production, but also policy makers just got better at, at managing the cycle. So, you know, policy errors kind of also lost a lot of share, if you will, in, in the overall prevalence of, of recessions. But when you think about what has given us the biggest headaches, it was 2008 a financial recession. and.com in a way is also a financial type of recession. So the share and the risk from financial blowups is, is significant if you look at it in recent history. And that doesn’t mean that the next recession will be that type, but its share of the risk spectrum is, is relatively high. 00:46:07 [Speaker Changed] So what should we be listening to when we hear economists discussing various risks? What are the red flags that hey, maybe this is a little too doom and gloomy for our own portfolio’s best interests? 00:46:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think the, the litmus test for me is often what would it take for a certain outcome, a for a certain doomsday outcome to actually come to pass. Not just will it happen and what would be the damage, but walk me through the conditions that actually lead us to the precipice and then make us fall off that macroeconomic cliff. Right? We, we need to, we need to talk about drivers causes, we need to talk about their probabilities and their constellations. So, you know, it’s, it’s not good enough to say, you know, the model says the recession will happen. Walk us through exactly what is the confluence of headwinds that together make that credible. Right? It’s, it’s, it’s, it’s more than the point forecast. 00:47:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh? Real, really kind of intriguing. I also notice that I’m not an economist, but when I listen to economists talk about the possibility of a black swan or the possibility of this event, it, it’s almost as if there won’t be any intervening actions either by the market or the policy makers. Tell us a little bit about that. What was George Soros phrase? Reflexivity reflexivity. That, that when certain events happen, there are gonna be natural reactions that just prevent this extrapolation to infinity or, or to zero as the case may be. Yeah, 00:47:46 [Speaker Changed] I mean this is back to the topic of stimulus for first and foremost, 2008 came as a big surprise because the models in, in, in the early part of the two thousands, they didn’t even really look at the financial sector as a risk driver. They kind of assumed the financial system away. And then when the, when the problem brewed and, and the financial system itself, the models were kind of blind to that. And then the reaction couldn’t be, couldn’t be gauged if you didn’t have view of that. And the reaction really depended on, on stimulus. And stimulus is about politics. It is about policy. It’s not about economics. First and foremost, it’s about political economy. It’s about people coming together and, and fighting crises. And so I, I think that remains the case that the idiosyncrasy happens before the crisis. The drivers are idiosyncratic. But the moment a crisis starts, a shock hits, what happens as a reaction is also idiosyncratic. It is political, it is, it is about society, it’s about choices. It’s not stuff that you can model in a rigid natural science way. 00:48:50 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about something that clearly wasn’t in the models. Forget 20 years ago. They weren’t in the models five years ago or even three years ago. And that’s the impact of artificial intelligence on our economy, on the labor pool and on productivity. How do you look at a giant structural change like ai? How do you put this into context as to what it might mean across all these different areas within tra both traditional economic modeling and, and the real world? 00:49:25 [Speaker Changed] You know, we, we’ve had productivity growth the last few decades. Even though often the narrative is productivity growth is really, really low. We’ve had productivity growth just not in services, but in the physical economy there’s been pretty decent productivity growth even the last 20 years where we didn’t have productivity growth with services because it didn’t have the technology to move that part of the economy along. Now why is that? Essentially productivity growth goes up when technology displaces labor. That is really the definition of productivity growth. You need to produce the same with less labor inputs or more with the same labor inputs. But either way, technology, whether we like it or not, is about the displacement of labor. And we weren’t able to do that in the service economy. Now with ai, I think you have a better chance of doing this, at least the promise is very strong that this will work. 00:50:18 But I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves and I’m not saying that now we’ve published on this over the last few years, even even as, as Covid hit and even before ai, when the zoom economy was sort of this dominant narrative. It’s a hard slog to do this. It happens over years and it’s little by little. It’s not a flip of the switch. It happens very incrementally. And I don’t think AI will turbocharge GDP growth. It is a lift to growth over the medium term, but there are many little obstacles. There are many little things that need to fall into place for people to really adopt the technology. And for this to little by little give us a tailwind. So it’s not an abrupt step change, it’s, it’s something that is credible, something we need to work through. And then it will, will show impact over a 10 year frame, 15 year frame. 00:51:05 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back a little bit on one thing you said. And I seem to have this ongoing debate with economists who work in a larger corporate framework. We’re here in Bloomberg, giant company, big operation. My day job is a much smaller company under a hundred employees. And I have noticed just over the course of the past decade how our productivity has skyrocketed and it’s a services business. Finance is a services business and it just feels like the things that used to take so long to do 15 and 20 years ago are now automated. And it’s not that we’re hiring fewer people and it’s not that we’re working shorter hours, but the same size team can just accomplish so much more than they were capable of per like I recall the days of quarterly reporting and having to literally run a model, create a printout for every client, print it out, stick it into the right, and like it, it was like a week long process, right? 00:52:17 That all hands on deck every quarter and now it’s updated 24 7, tick by tick, it’s automated. No one cares about quarterly reports ’cause you could get it. And the joke is you have 24 7 access to your daily, weekly, monthly, year to date, five year, 10 year performance reports. Just try not to check it second by second, right? But the, the way, and that’s just one example, being able to communicate with clients to record and embed an interactive video with charts and everything else, right? That was like a massive undertaking and now it’s like child’s play, even though you’re, you’re doing the same thing, you’re just doing it faster, better, cheaper, easier. Are, are we somehow underestimating the productivity gains or are these just specific to, you know, that Yeah. One area. 00:53:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I, I have some pushback on that. I think the bar for productivity growth is, is a little higher and it’s very specific. It’s, it’s less inputs per output. So do things get more comfortable? Are they moving faster? Are they qualitatively perhaps better? Yes. But are we using less inputs to generate the same value or are we using the same level of inputs to generate more value? That is what we need to achieve. To speak of productivity growth, and let me give you an example that we use in the book. You know, I took an Uber from my apartment to, to come here into the studio today. And Uber is often upheld as, as the epitome of progress in tech. And it is fascinating. It’s a great app. I love to use it. It’s, it’s nice. But look, if you want to improve the productivity growth in taxi transportation, we have to talk about inputs and outputs, right? And the inputs are on the capital side, a car, and you’re not getting rid of that car. And on the labor side, it’s, it’s the driver. And the Uber car still has that driver, 00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] Not Waymo in parts of, of the west coast. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And this is why I said it takes time incrementally that will happen and that will unfold. But do you think you’re gonna have driverless taxis in New York in 2028 or 2030? I don’t, it’s 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] Like, well we have it in 2050, probably in 2040. I can’t tell you what exact year it’ll happen, but Right, it’s coming. 00:54:39 [Speaker Changed] I agree with you. And that’s the, 00:54:40 [Speaker Changed] The sooner we embed those RFID devices in vehicles and on street corners, like doing it visually in lidar is very 20th century, 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] Right? Yeah. And that’s why I said it takes time over time. This will, this will be substantial lift to, to economic output. But it doesn’t happen overnight. It’s, it’s actually, it takes time, right? And there’s an additional important point about productivity growth that is, can also be shown in this taxi example when technology is truly productivity enhancing. You see that in falling prices, technology is deflationary, right? As technology does away with input costs, firms will compete with lower prices to gain market share. So across history, wherever you look as technology is becoming a credible force in production, prices will fall. Now look at Uber. Uber prices in New York tend to be higher than a yellow cab. Why? Because despite this expensive technology, you’re not able to produce this ride more cheaply. You’re not, in fact, you kind of have to monetize the technological expense. The app is expensive, all is expensive. So generally you’re paying a, a premium for the smoothness of the app and all that. Over time that may change. But watch prices, you wanna see productivity growth, whether it’s happening or not, you gotta look at prices. And that’s one of the arguments we’re making in the book. 00:56:03 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s phonically adjust. We’ll stay with Uber, let’s phonically adjust that in New York City, if you want to taxi during rush hour, hey, sorry, you’re outta luck. Because the monopoly that, that was imbued by the taxing Limousine Commission and a handful of big medallion chain owners decided in their infinite wisdom that we don’t need to move people around rush hour. We’re gonna change shifts then. Which by the way, is my pet theory for how Uber penetrated. And so a, you could get a Uber during rush hour that you can’t during cab rides. You could get an Uber when it’s raining. Good luck hailing a cab in, in New York City rain. And you have the ability to schedule an Uber, you have the ability to get a higher quality car. You could get an electric car if you choose a larger car. Like I, I’m not a huge fan of traditional hedonic adjustment because it was a way of kind of tamping down on the cost of living adjustments always felt sort of disingenuous. 00:57:08 But I don’t think you could get anybody to say that Uber is not only better and I’m not a big Uber fan, but as a user, Uber is certainly better than a cab. And in many ways orders of magnitude better, more choices. More options and just a higher quality experience. Plus, you know, just the idea of having, Hey, is this a a work thing or I’m gonna use that card on the app. Well, no, this is personal, I’ll use that card. Right? So, so maybe taxis aren’t the best example, but when, let, let’s talk about economists. I, I want, again, I wanna stay with this ’cause I love the topic. Think about the quantity of research you push, you push out the ability to integrate charts and data and like I am been in this business long enough that I can rem First of all, when I started the guys in the technical group, they were doing charts with pencil and graph paper. 00:58:11 I’m not exaggerating, maybe that’s just a function of my age. But think about how, and the, the cheat was, you get a different feel when you’re doing it point by point than when you’re just generating it. Whether that’s true or not, at least that was the, when, when computers came along, people continued to do that. But think about the access you have to the just endless array of data, the ability to, to do that. I, I, I haven’t even mentioned your fortune column. Think about how much time and effort goes into putting out a column and you go back 25 years and it was just a horrific grinds. Like, at this point, everybody seems to use some version of Grammarly or some other editing software. The ability to put out, and I’m not talking about asking chat GPT to generate a garbage article for you. You writing something, cleaning it up, betting a lot of data and images, it just feels like, you know, to quote Hemingway, you know, gradually, and then all at once, it just feels like it’s so much easier to put out a much higher quality product with either the same or less effort than 25 years ago. Maybe I’m just hyperfocused on the junk I do, but what’s incrementally your experience been 00:59:36 [Speaker Changed] Like Incre Absolutely. Incrementally, there’s progress. But again, the, the, the bar we need to meet is, is value. Are we generating more value with the same inputs, or are we generating the same value with less inputs? That’s the definition of productivity growth. So if you can make all these charts faster and you save one economist on the team, well that’s productivity growth. Or you keep the economist and you double your, your number of reports and you also manage to monetize them and earn revenue for it. Well, that’s productivity growth. If the charts get prettier faster, fancier with the same number of economists in the same number of revenues, well, from an economic sense perspective, that’s not productivity growth. So it’s gotta be a change in the relationship of inputs to outputs if we are comfortably talking about productivity growth. And back to the Uber example, you’re right, you can get different cars to ride in. You can get the car, the Uber car when it’s raining, but you’re paying for that, right? So it’s not produced more productively. Right. You’re paying a surcharge, you’re paying the, the, the, the, the search pricing. I think they call it an Uber, right? So, you know, yeah, you can get it when it rains, but you’ll, you’ll pay twice as much. So it wasn’t, it wasn’t done more productively. Right. 01:00:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. The gap between the increased quantity and quality of output, if we’re not monetizing it, or as a consumer, if you’re not seeing price de declines, then it doesn’t really count as productivity 01:01:02 [Speaker Changed] Gains. No, it’s gotta be a change in the ratio of inputs to outputs on either side. Either we keep all the staff and we earn more revenue with it. That’s productivity growth. Or we keep the revenue constant and we do it with less inputs. That’s more productivity growth. But you know, I, again, I’m not saying there isn’t productivity. There is, and, and there will be more and AI will have impact. It just needs to show up in value. Gotcha. In that, in that relationship between inputs and outputs, I, 01:01:28 [Speaker Changed] I see it qualitatively, but I completely get what, what you’re saying quantitatively are, are you still doing the Fortune column on a regular 01:01:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, we publish in Fortune relatively regularly. Whenever we see a, a cyclical or a thematic topic that we feel is pressing, we we publish with, with Fortune. Yep. 01:01:48 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. All right. I only have you for a limited amount of time. I know you’re catching a flight today. Let me jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with what are you streaming these days? What’s keeping you entertained either Netflix or podcasts or whatever? 01:02:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I’m, I’m not very big on, on shows or Hollywood. I mean, to give an idea, I think I’m on the second season of Slow Horses. I think, I think there are four seasons of it. I’m kind of slowly making my way through the second, second one. It’s very entertaining. I, I love Gary Ottman, 01:02:21 [Speaker Changed] So interesting. He’s great in 01:02:22 [Speaker Changed] It. Yeah. It was sort of the taking down the genre of, of spy movies in a, in a very entertaining way. So I’m, I’m doing that, but also I tend to watch late in the day when I’m tired. So it’s, it’s entirely possible I fall asleep and I take like two, three evenings to get through on episode. Yeah. So I, I’m, I’m not, I’m not all that big on, on that, on that front. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Tell us about your mentors who helped to shape your career. 01:02:44 [Speaker Changed] So many people, right, because a lot of it is teamwork and, and you don’t, you don’t progress without mentors and, and role models. I would say in the, in my current role, I would probably call that two people, rich, lesser our long time CEO. And our chairman, he, he had the vision for a macro product, as did Martin Reeves, who, who runs our research institute, the Henderson Institute. And they’re really the two people who brought me into this role and coached me. So they stand out outside of BCG Kathleen Stefansson. She had many, many different roles on Wall Street and economist role. She’s, she’s been a, a great help navigating my career the last many years. And further back and academia, thesis advisors and many others there, there, it’s, it’s always teamwork in a way. So you have many, many role models and mentors. 01:03:34 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:03:39 [Speaker Changed] Right now, I am almost done with making sense of chaos by De Farmer came out last year. De Farmer is a very interesting character. He’s a complexity scientist at the Santa Fe Institute, and I think at Oxford University as well. And his book is interesting to me. I bumped into him at one or two conferences. But it is interesting to me, particularly because he kind of argues the opposite of, of what we argue in our book. So he thinks he agrees that economics is, is poor if you just take standard models and theory. But he believes he can crack the complexity of it. So he thinks with, with, with complexity signs and better data and better models, you’ll essentially be able to make those forecasts. I read it because it’s always important to see what others are arguing. I don’t read stuff that, that reconfirms what I think. 01:04:26 I wanna see what other people are saying about the same topic from different angles. So that book’s been, been very useful and, and also well written. That’s what I’m currently reading. I think of other books that I’ve read over the years. I mean, there’s so many, many great ones. Of course, I think one that early on made an impression on me was seeing Like a state by James Scott, huh? It’s at least 25 years old. I read it as a grad student. And what he does, he, he looks at the ability of governments to do top down policy to improve the lives of, of large amounts of people. And he shows all the pitfalls in a sort of hayekian way. It’s tough to have the local knowledge, it’s tough to do the top down improvements. Things have to grow bottom up. And that book kind of stood out for being very, very eclectic. Very multidisciplinary, and still, I think an excellent book to, to how to think laterally and not in a sort of strict model based way. 01:05:23 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really interesting. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in a career in economics, investment finance, anything along those lines? 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, you know, I think a career as an economist is challenging in some ways. There, there’s so many economists out there often when, when I hire, you see the, the flood of cvs and often very good cvs. And there’s, I think there’s been an overproduction of economists. So I think doing something adjacent to economics, you know, work in finance, work on the buy side, work on the sell side, unless you tru, unless your heart truly beats for economics. I, I think, you know, you can use economic skills and, and many adjacent disciplines and, and careers, I think are, are plentiful and, and those adjacent disciplines, if economics graduates really feel strongly about economics, it’s fascinating, but your heart has to be in it. And there aren’t all that many seats as economists, right? So, so when has to build that over the long term. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of economics today? You wish you knew 25, 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:06:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well, I mean, that’s really what I wrote down in the book. You know, the book is, is the 2025 year journey through the maze of, of the economics, profession and discipline, the themes we touched on the master model mentality, the pitfalls of, of trading economics, like a, like a physical science, the doom mongering, which we have to simply ignore most of the time. And then the eclectic approach to economics. I call it economic eclecticism, drawing on, on, on a broader range of disciplines. Those are the things that I, that I learned through that path the last 20 years. I wrote them up in the book, you know, it would’ve been, would’ve been interesting for me to read that 20 years ago, but I, I wrote it now. And so I’m happy with that. Huh. 01:07:23 [Speaker Changed] Really, really intriguing. Philip, thank you for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Philip Carlson Leszek, he’s global chief economist for the Boston Consulting Group. His new book, shocks, crises and False Alarms, how to Assess True Macroeconomic Risk.

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human workâand none of these estimates include the cost of human laborâbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic âblitzscalingâ: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, itâs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, âThatâs nothing.â) Weâve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little thatâs concrete about OpenAIâs finances, everything weâve seen suggests that theyâre far from profitable2âa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAIâs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the USâs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I donât want to rush to the conclusion that it isnât necessary or advisable. But thatâs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. Thatâs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. Itâs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaireâs toy for achieving science fictionâs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work thatâs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of theseâand other cloud providersâare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we donât know how to answer yetâand probably wonât until weâre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although itâs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollarsâand possibly much lessâthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure thatâs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure thatâs needed will allow us to build a future thatâs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruptionâno doubt disruption thatâs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but thatâs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that weâll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencionâs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of âgarage AIâ startups, startups that arenât dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and âengagementââa process that, weâve seen, inevitably results in enshittificationâwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AIâs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining âalready hereâ¦just not unevenly distributed yet.â The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does ârelentlessly pro-humanâ mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of âgeneral intelligence.â Iâve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence isâthey’ve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isnât a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isnât a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedolâupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesnât fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machinesâat least in 2025âis that humans can want to do something. Machines canât. AlphaGo doesnât want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesnât want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; thatâs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, âI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.â You may not want to be there, but thatâs where creation startsâand creation is the reward. Thatâs why Iâm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, âItâs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people donât enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.â Donât get me wrongâSunoâs product is impressive, and Iâm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people donât enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didnât want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldnât have to say, âDonât quit the day job,â or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poetsâany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a âmoatâ that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. Weâre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for ârelentlessly pro-humanâ AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesnât matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what ârelentlessly humanâ might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isnât the lines of code that they produce; itâs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We wonât have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they wonât want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solveâthatâs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, weâre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is âslouching towards Bethlehemâ? We donât know, but there are some conclusions that we canât avoid: While there are many challenges to overcomeâlatency being the greatest of themâsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get ârelentlessly humanâ applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? Weâre about to find out.

Title: How To Create A More Agile Business For The Trump Era

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff. It’s no secret that President Donald Trump’s economic policies have made uncertainty the theme of business in 2025 so far. His chaotic approach to tariffs—announcing them as coming, delayed and then imposed, sometimes with just days’ notice, has set most businesses on edge. Last month, financial health analytics company RapidRatings found that nearly seven in 10 supply chain professionals expect risks to escalate this year. Even before potential tariffs were looming, 81% of respondents said they had experienced supply chain disruptions in the last 24 months. Nearly a third of all of those disruptions cost more than $5 million, the survey found. A blog post from RapidRatings Executive Chair James Gellert brings the tariff threat into more acute focus. The post considers the possibility of a 25% tariff on China, Canada, Mexico and Germany, and finds it would significantly increase the risk faced by 25% of all public companies and 39% of all private companies. The whiplash of Trump-era tariff threats makes these impacts more significant. Companies and countries don’t know if announced tariffs will stand and effective dates will continue. Last week, a new round of tariffs took effect on Tuesday—25% on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on goods from China, adding up to 20%. On Wednesday, Trump decided to exempt Canadian and Mexican tariffs for U.S. automakers. On Thursday, Trump extended that monthlong pause on Canadian and Mexican tariffs to all goods covered by current trade agreements. But on Friday, he once again threatened tariffs on Canada—this time reciprocal tariffs on lumber and dairy products. This week promises more tariff headaches: 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports go into effect on Wednesday. Policies like this are wide-reaching and make planning difficult for companies. They’ve also sunk the stock market, with last week being the worst in six months. On a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump downplayed the market drop but didn’t deny the policies could result in a recession, saying that there will be “a period of transition,” and in the end it will end “great for us.” Figuring out what to do in the current situation is a huge challenge for businesses in many sectors. I talked to Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning company Coupa, about how to get a plan together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. People demonstrate during a protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite National Park. More jobs were cut in February than any other month since July 2020, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray& Christmas. Nationwide, there were roughly 172,000 job cuts last month. As far as February goes, last month’s cuts were the largest since 2009 during the midst of the Great Recession. More than a third of these cuts were in federal government positions, part of Elon Musk’s cost-slashing actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. These speedy and seemingly arbitrary and unfocused cuts have not just impacted federal government workers; CEOs of companies working with the federal government have started to talk about uncertainty caused by these cuts in their quarterly reports, the Washington Post reports. But the government isn’t the only sector seeing deep cuts. Retail is also seeing them, with the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showing 45,375 job cuts announced in the first two months of the year—an increase of 572% over the first two months of 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. According to Labor Department data released last week, the unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in February, though its timing doesn’t necessarily capture the full extent of government job cuts. However, the U.S. added just 151,000 non-farm jobs last month, the weakest February growth since 2019 and missing economists’ forecasts of 170,000 new jobs. A Target store in Novato, California. Target reported soft earnings last week, with declines in net sales, gross margins and earnings, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Compared with the same period last year, sales were down 3.1% and operating income dropped 21.3%. In its earnings report, Target warned of “meaningful year-over-year profit pressure” in the current quarter due to uncertainty—both among consumers and on tariffs. In an interview with CNBC last week, Target CEO Brian Cornell said that produce prices are likely to tick upwards within days of tariff enactment. As its sales and stock price are slipping, Cornell and his senior executive team hosted a meeting last week to discuss a comeback strategy for the retailer, Danziger reported. The retailer is striving to get back to its “Tarzhay” image—a term coined decades ago when it was perceived to be a store that made the everyday elevated and upscale. Target plans to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion in its stores, supply chain and technology over the next five years, with the planned outcome of $15 billion in sales growth. The company plans to invest more in its Good & Gather and Favorite Day private label brands, continue to grow its beauty section, reduce lead times for its home and apparel merchandise, expand partnerships with popular clothing and accessories brands, and enhance omnichannel shopping with AI recommendations and optimized search results. Aside from those investments, however, Target faces a distinct political challenge. In 2023, the retailer went all in on Pride Month-themed merchandise, a polarizing choice in some areas, which brought the store’s corporate reputation score down. Dialing back the merchandise assortment last year didn’t help matters much. As 2025 began and the Trump Administration began cracking down on diversity measures in the government, Target dialed down its diversity, equity and inclusion goals, sending its reputational score down again. The retailer was singled out as part of the February 28 People Union USA Economic Blackout—during which visits to physical stores were down 11% and app usage dropped 14%. A group of Black faith leaders is urging a 40-day boycott of the retailer to coincide with Lent. A New York City Walgreens store. Following years of store closings, falling stock prices and challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance is being taken private by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a roughly $10 billion, writes Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen. The company’s Walgreens and Boots stores will continue to operate, the companies said. Many of the company’s issues stemmed from its rollout of VillageMD clinics, a physician-staffed operator in which Walgreens had a controlling stake. A lack of patients for the clinics led to huge net losses. Japsen writes that VillageMD was the primary reason for losing over $8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The transaction is expected to close at the end of this year. Leagh Turner, Coupa CEO. President Donald Trump’s trade policies and announcements about tariffs have been wreaking havoc worldwide among leaders in both governments and businesses. Companies are working to make the best decisions for their bottom lines, investors and consumers in an environment where conditions are quickly changing. I spoke with Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning software platform Coupa, about how businesses can plan for tariff uncertainty, both now and in the future. Our conversation took place in early March when 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico—both now suspended for a month—first took effect. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What are new tariffs doing to companies? Turner: Companies are going to have to change. Are people ready for nationalism versus globalism? Are they ready for trade to be increasingly based on proximity? New trade partnerships? Goods flowing in different ways and are they ready to optimize for that? If the market’s going to win, companies need to try and find a way to deal with those things quickly and to optimize. How agile are companies? Are they thinking about these things? Do they have the technology to be able to do it? Are people in the right positions thinking about it? Is technology ready to be able to support this? The answer is: To varying degrees but by and large, yes. It’s going to feel like a belt-tightening and a process reinforcement period. And that’s OK, because let’s be honest, If you’re a large global financial institution, you should be spending within appropriate limits. You should have guardrails in place that allow for people to do those things right in the day-to-day. That’s just good practice. It’ll give them more working capital, more cash in hand. It will allow them to be a little bit more resilient to these tariffs or changing policies and allow them to think about what they do next. Once you get the basics, planning is super important. Who do or could I buy from? What would that do to the way that I flow goods into my company? What scenario of all the available scenarios is optional or optimal to me? What does it do to my P&L, and what choices do I make when those become constrained? We’re not done; we’ve put up trade barriers between all countries and the Americas. But there will be a global reverberation. It’s going to be this really interesting elastic effect for a long period of time that people need to insulate themselves from. You get the basics. You drive up your working capital and cash on hand. You do some really good scenario planning. Technology can help you do that. Here’s the awesome thing: The last time we had to go through anything of this order of magnitude, we didn’t have monster data stores and real access to clean data. AI is upon us and we should be leveraging it to help us make good decisions. How should companies be planning for short-term versus long-term? First, accept the reality: We’re just getting started. The second is: Go grab the low-hanging fruit. Pressure is an opportunity to get better. If a business has been operating with loose controls and has been allowing creativity to be deployed against uncreative things, then stop. We have this measure that we use in our business: the amount of spend that you have under management, meaning how much of your spending is controlled. One of the companies that I spoke to over the course of the last week has 3% of their global spending under control, which means that 97% of their spending is not controlled. It’s based on the person who’s doing the spending. In 2025, it precludes you from being agile and from being able to cope with the current circumstances. Once you face the truth that we’re just at the beginning, to get really disciplined. Technology companies have a massive responsibility right now to say that which can be known is known. Instead of bearing down, look up. Scenario plan, leverage the mass deployment of AI to be able to make decisions that you could never have made absent that technology, and create a business that is far more agile than it was prior. Let me say more optimistically that maybe this is just a correction. Maybe this is just an opportunity for everybody, like the great financial crisis, to get better for those who are really diligent and rigorous. And for the cream to rise to the top. At an investor conference last week, streaming giant Netflix announced it would increase its spending on original content in 2025. 11%: Year-over-year increase in content spending, which adds up to a planned $18 billion 301 million: Netflix subscribers, as of its most recent earnings report ‘We do expect the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown to slow’: MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a research note last week about Netflix, which led the company’s stock to drop more than 8% One of the most effective ways to improve your company is putting your employees at the center. And the best way to do that is simple: Prioritizing their well-being. Generative AI can bring positive results to your business in efficiency, creativity, employee satisfaction and consumer experience. But to make it work for you, you need to be able to scale it.

Choose your location By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Hey, guys. So I’m noticing egg prices are still super high and the stock market has been dropping kind of fast and inflation is up and thousands of federal workers are getting laid off. But you know what? In moments like this, I find solace in one thing: The billionaires are going to be just fine. President Donald Trump did say that he’d fix high food prices on Day 1 , and that everything was going to get better immediately. And now he and other people in his administration are using words like “ pain ,” “ disturbance ” and “ detox period .” I don’t really like those words, but I don’t think they will impact important people like Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, who all stood behind Trump during his inauguration when he said : “The Golden Age of America begins right now.” I guess “right now” isn’t exactly “right now” for us, but perhaps the billionaires get to enter the Golden Age first, which seems only fair. Opinion: Tariffs? Not on that! (Yet.) You're fired! Oops, you're rehired. Trump is all chaos. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about Trump’s recent tariffs and the trade war they’ve launched and said: “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” I wondered for a moment if he had ever visited America, but then I realized he was probably talking about billionaires who historically have not had to worry about cheap goods, unless a sharply discounted private island counts as one. So while I, personally, am in favor of cheap goods, as they allow me to spend less money to continue living, I totally understand why the American dream of the wealthy will be unfazed by tariffs. Prices are bound to increase for U.S. consumers , but the rich can endure a Wagyu beef bump just fine, and the rest of us already know how to stretch a box of mac and cheese out over several days anyway. That brings me comfort as I travel to the grocery store to purchase one egg with my weekly wages. Bessent then told CNBC on Friday that all the things Trump and Musk are doing to the federal government – which appears to be mainly firing people and flipping the “TARIFFS” switch on and off over and over again – might put the economy through a “ detox period .” “There’s an adjustment,” The Treasury chief said . “We’ll see whether there’s pain.” OK. My preference would be for there to not be pain, but I do rest easy knowing that Bessent, who according to The New York Times has assets and investments “worth in excess of $700 million,” will not feel that pain the same way you or I might. I simply hate it when stratospherically rich people feel pain. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday told Fox News that regular Americans shouldn’t worry about things like price increases or the S&P 500 having its worst week in months : “We're transitioning from Bidenomics and the terrible economy that was delivered by the last administration. It takes a while to turn that ship around.” You see, transitioning from 50 straight months of job growth , the second best market returns for a presidential term since 1945 and factory construction hitting its highest point in over 50 years is going to take some time. President Joe Biden had to fix the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, so it only makes sense Republicans and their billionaire assistants will need time to take it apart and make it work better for them. A Times headline Friday read: “Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook.” Per that story: “Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data . And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. "Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession.” Opinion: Trump's speech was all about dodging responsibility for the economy he's crashing Now it might sound bad when you put all those words in one place, but remember, if you’re a billionaire, everything’s probably going to work out great. For the rest of us, there will apparently be some pain, some disturbance and some detoxing. But I imagine we deserve that for not being uber-rich. Rather than look at my glass as half-empty, I prefer to look at the glasses of billionaires as overflowing onto the floor, and then being mopped up by servants whose glasses are all-the-way empty.

What we need to focus on as we stand in the unemployment line or put off retirement for a few years or trade our least-productive child for a carton of expired eggs is that Musk and Bezos and Zuckerberg and Trump are on solid footing with nothing to worry about. Don’t be discouraged by our current Golden Age. I’m sure the billionaires the president is helping get billionaire-ier are living their best lives on our behalf, and they’ll welcome us in soon, or possibly never.
