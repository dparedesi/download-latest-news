Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As a brand hailing from Britain, Nothing has been around since 2020, and the Phone 3 is its first true flagship aimed at taking on the best in the industry. The company’s name is a wide-open door for puns, but nevertheless, Nothing could be a serious contender in the Android space going forward. Its current rise reminds me a lot of the earlier years of OnePlus, which isn’t all that surprising since both were founded by the same man, Carl Pei. He left OnePlus and started up Nothing as a grassroots alternative in a similar vein. This is a first for me, as I hadn’t tested a Nothing phone prior to this, and one with a daring camera setup makes for an ideal start. The Phone 3 is readily available in North America starting at $800, yet also has the pedigree of Chinese brands to some extent. How it all comes together yields intriguing and vexing results. The Phone 3’s physical design is open to interpretation. Does it look like a science experiment or a crafty take on otherwise common builds from others? For my eyes, it’s a unique look that’s easy enough to cover up with a case if a little too eccentric, though I personally don’t mind it at all. I also appreciate that Nothing includes a basic silicone case in the box to add some protection from the start, retaining the transparent back’s visibility with Gorilla Glass Victus offering its own layer of durability. Another unique element is the small red square that is actually an LED that lights up when recording video. One of the standout design elements is what Nothing calls its Glyph Interface, a circular LED display on the top corner that functions almost as an independent system. By default, it tells the time, stopwatch, and timer, battery level, and an odd spin-the-bottle game. It can do much more when making adjustments in the settings to include volume indicators, charging progress, and tying certain glyph animations to specific apps. For instance, you have one for WhatsApp, another for Uber, and yet another for email. I wasn’t able to create one for the Camera app that actually worked, so it’s more of a boon to the rest of the phone. Certainly a gimmicky feature, to a degree, but I’ve grown to like it because it makes it easier to leave the phone face down. The fact I can also set a “rule” for an animation to pop up when a specific contact messages me is convenient, though my smartwatch can effectively do the same thing in real time. On the flip side, the 6.77-inch AMOLED display (2800 x 1260) is gorgeous, with an adaptive refresh rate that will ramp up to 120Hz or down to 10Hz depending on what you’re doing onscreen. Peak brightness (for HDR content) hits 4,500 nits. While pretty visible in bright sunlight, it’s also fairly reflective, so a mixed bag in that regard. A responsive fingerprint sensor makes it relatively easy to bypass the lock screen. With IP68 dust and water resistance, this is Nothing’s first phone you can submerge in clear water, making it far less risky to capture some stills or clips at a pool or lake. Nothing also makes a curious choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor over the 8 Elite other Android flagships adopted this year. Indeed, Qualcomm refers to the 8s Gen 4 chip as an “affordable flagship”, which is marketing speak for a step down in performance, but it’s also more in line with other devices in this price range. A 5,150mAh battery is adequate for a device this size, and it holds up quite well in daily real-world conditions, consistently lasting a full day. Configurations start at 12GB of RAM and 256GB and go up to 16GB and 512GB, respectively. The 50-megapixel main camera (24mm equivalent) uses the same OmniVision OV50H Type 1/1.3-inch sensor as the Vivo X Fold 3 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. The f/1.7 aperture is also in line with both devices, so we have an idea of what to expect from it. Unless you shoot at full resolution, all photos are downsampled to 12.5 megapixels through pixel binning. The 50-megapixel telephoto (70mm equivalent) goes with the Samsung Isocell JN5 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with f/2.7 aperture — one we’ve seen in a myriad of phones over the last three years. In certain modes, Nothing offers a 6x hybrid zoom 140mm equivalent that’s basically a crop of the telephoto’s focal range. While you can shoot at full resolution at 3x (70mm), you can’t do it zooming in further than that. Otherwise, you have to settle for pixel-binned 12.5-megapixel shots. Finally, the 50-megapixel ultra-wide uses the Samsung Isocell JN1 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, a sensor that is fairly common among other brands. Unlike the other two rear lenses, this one isn’t stabilized and is fixed focus, limiting its versatility. This also applies to the 50-megapixel front camera, which uses the exact same sensor and specs. Instead of a separate mode for shooting full-resolution images, you select the resolution from the drop-down menu. The problem is that it inevitably resets to the lower resolution after a while with no warning, so if you’re walking around snapping photos along the way, you’re forced to double-check that 50MP capture is still active. This happened to me a few times, and I was lucky enough to catch it without losing the high-res capture I wanted. Unfortunately, that’s the only way to go full-res, since Expert mode only lets you shoot in RAW with pixel binning. This can pay dividends in low-light conditions, but otherwise feels pointless in brighter settings or when capturing a dramatic landscape. For a flagship, it feels far too limiting. Nothing presents a few interesting software elements that can affect how you take photos with the Phone 3. Tap the bottom arrow in the camera app, and various presets appear in a menu, including Black and White Film, Retro, Soft Focus, and Lenticular. What’s really neat is it lets you import or create your own. To import, simply scan the QR code to add it to the list. Another way is to create a .cube file to bring in a LUT or preset from apps like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve (among others) by uploading it directly from the phone’s camera app. Simply select the filter menu from the drop-down menu, tap the + icon and you have the ability to bring it in, either from local storage or pulled in from Google Drive. Yet another option is to create a preset from any photo, even if you’ve transferred or downloaded it from elsewhere. Why make all this available? The phone’s Gallery app has a decent editing toolset, except it lacks any sort of curve tool or deeper color grading. I tried this out in different ways, one of which was to use the Gallery app first, upload to Lightroom to work on the finer details more accurately, and then download the result back to the phone. That way, I could create a preset using the color grading that the phone and its imaging pipeline would then work to emulate. While not a perfect solution, it is one of the more interesting methodologies I’ve seen that caters to mobile photographers of all stripes. It’s also the most creative outlet in a device that otherwise ignores AI-driven editing features or special modes. The Phone 3 isn’t devoid of AI, however, and one feature tied to the Essential Key — the button under the power button on the phone — is applicable to photography. Press the button with anything onscreen and you can write down a note or ask a question for context. This is great for two reasons. First, it makes it a lot easier to snap a quick photo as a reminder or to look something up. Second, it opens up access to contextual information with the assistance of ChatGPT. To test out a good example, I used a photo I took of the lunar eclipse and asked it when the next eclipse would be. It then listed the upcoming dates for both partial and full lunar eclipses based on my location. It’s true that Google’s Circle to Search essentially does the same thing, only the key difference here is that all of these Essential Key screenshots save to the Essential Spaces app. It essentially (pun intended) acts as an offline resource that’s always there to reference anytime. Granted, it’s far from perfect, as evidenced by the fact that it doesn’t always offer much insight, but it can be great at helping find information. On the other hand, ask it to suggest how to make a photo look better, and it won’t offer much insight at all. I will address the two main sticking points for the camera before discussing the positives. There’s a noticeable shutter lag that afflicts every mode except Action and Video. In some cases, it’s so bad that it can take up to two full seconds before it snaps the image. It’s also inconsistent in ways that are hard to discern or explain. I could never figure out why it would be slow to capture a photo in outdoor settings, only to feel much more instantaneous when taking other shots in the same general area. I will update this review once Nothing responds to queries, but if I were to take a stab at it, I would guess that the HDR processing engine immediately sets how many images it needs to quickly snap and merge. The other issue is lens flare and ghosting. Nothing needs to look at whatever coating it’s using for the Phone 3’s lenses because it happens in varying scenarios where it doesn’t impact other phones in the same spots. The photo of the rabbit is a good example of how it can create glare that not only hazes the composition but also plants ugly ghosting in the frame. All I was trying to do was lower the perspective to get a more interesting shot, but the flaring never let up. Meanwhile, two competitors’ phones didn’t seem to suffer from the same problem. Nothing has just released a firmware update to improve its Ultra XDR processing and address this issue. I’ll update this review if that leads to better results. Those two significant drawbacks aside, the Phone 3 surprised me in good ways, with the Action mode turning out to be one of the biggest gems. Nothing wisely offers it in both the main and telephoto cameras, and much like other competing phones with a similar feature, the idea here is to increase shutter speed and utilize HDR processing to manipulate both ISO and virtual aperture to freeze everything. Tougher lighting conditions get in the way, yet broad daylight can lead to fabulous results. The skateboarder is a good example — not only did I take the shot with the telephoto lens, I also cropped in further and retained good detail. Action doesn’t support burst shooting (only Photo mode does), but quickly tapping the shutter can deliver multiple good shots. Equally impressive is the way the Phone 3 handles HDR, although time of day and light exposure play a significant role. It may struggle to pull out the blues in the sky on a bright sunny vista, only to then wonderfully subdue the sun’s intensity in a horizon sunset. When it works well, you love having that kind of power in your pocket, despite how it cuts both ways. One thing I appreciate is that the Phone 3 handles exposed light sources well enough to avoid outright clipping or underexposing shadows — again, owing to the Ultra XDR’s efficacy. However, the angle is your only real defense against flare or glare creeping in, so tilting ever so slightly might be enough to ward it off in those instances because it can happen indoors or outdoors. General results will look great on a phone screen, though you may notice more imperfections when pixel peeping. It’s one of those things where really good photos are obvious and forgettable clunkers equally so. That’s not to say the Phone 3 is inconsistent, more that it nudges you to use some of the available tools to close the gap. The telephoto lens is a great example of what I’m referring to, mainly because it sometimes captures brilliance and then mediocrity all in one sitting. It impresses more often than not, but I would like to see more consistency. For one thing, you could take two shots from the same vantage point and come out with different color tones in each. Blue skies are the most obvious example of when this happens, though other rich examples, like foliage, vehicles, and graffiti, can lead to similar results. Despite all that, I leaned heavily on the telephoto to get me the shots I wanted from a distance. Even the 10x hybrid zoom (240mm equivalent) can produce a decent result with the help of AI Zoom when it kicks in. It also doubles as a macro shooter and accords itself well in that role. Rich and detailed, it’s one of the more surprising elements to the broader camera system. This ultra-wide sensor has been around for a while, and it shows. The lack of both OIS and broader focusing tend to affect performance but it’s more that the XDR processing just isn’t as effective here. While it is a 50-megapixel sensor, Nothing doesn’t let you shoot with it in full-res where you might salvage some detail in good lighting. Apart from the LUTs and presets, this is one of the main anchors for the camera system. It can produce action shots that simply aren’t possible on an iPhone or Samsung phone without doing a lot more work. Action mode takes both multiple photos and a super short video clip in the backend to help render a still that freezes a subject in motion. We’ve seen this sort of thing from OnePlus, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor before, but it’s yet to truly catch on from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google. As I noted earlier, it’s also the fastest shutter available on the camera app. Rapidly pressing the button enables you to capture the action in fairly short intervals — under a second long — to increase the chance of capturing something dynamic. The one caveat is the subject’s speed. People and (most) animals are easier, whereas objects can be tougher to precisely nail down at higher velocities. Mind you, distance also matters like it does with any action photography, so the same rules generally apply here, too. In low-light conditions, including indoors, you have to watch out for ramped-up ISO to offset the higher shutter speed, which could lead to a noisier result. I focused more on still photography, but also tried out video. For whatever reason, Nothing doesn’t enable using the same LUTs and presets to capture footage. Select a preset, and it reverts right back to Photo mode. Otherwise, you can record in 4K or Full HD resolution at 30p or 60p frame rates. The only other video modes are Slo-Mo and Time-lapse. Video quality is quite good in ideal settings, and with HDR mode, you have the option to record in H.265 for extra control in post-production, if desired. The Nothing Phone 3 is in an interesting spot. The brand doesn’t have the kind of imaging partnerships Chinese brands have, nor is it a household name in North America like the Big 3. NothingOS is one of the best Android overlays I’ve seen for the simple fact it strongly resembles stock Android. The build quality and hardware are solid, and battery life is excellent, so this phone ticks off a lot of the right boxes. I can understand how some might view the cameras as a drag on the overall package, especially given the competition at similar prices. But for an upstart brand trying its hand at a flagship, this is a very good debut. I tested the Nothing Phone 3 at the same time as the Vivo X200 FE, and the latter proved to be a more capable shooter in varying circumstances. On the flip side, NothingOS is a pleasure compared to Funtouch OS. The OnePlus 13R is closer in both price and performance in that it lacks Hasselblad’s input, and is a worthy option given how good OxygenOS is as an Android overlay. The Xiaomi 15 may cost a bit more but it retains many of the imaging trappings of the Ultra model. The upcoming Xiaomi 15T Pro (or something similar) may also be in the same wheelhouse. The Honor 400 is compelling as a cheaper option — except if you want a telephoto lens, get the Pro version. Maybe. NothingOS is a draw for sure because software is so vitally important to our daily interactions with phones. It’s not clear how much Nothing will try to fix on the camera side through further updates but if you like something fun and quirky, the Phone 3 is it.

Title: Nuro, Uber And Lucid Join Robotaxi Race. Will Luxury Be Key?

ByBrad Templeton ByBrad Templeton, Senior Contributor. Lucid vehicle with Nuro driver added to it for testing Self-driving developer Nuro and Luxury EV maker Lucid have formed a partership with investment from Uber to build a new player in the Robotaxi contest. Each brings an important ingredient, and together they fill an interesting strategic niche--is it the right one? Nuro was formed by two top engineers I worked with in the earliest days of Waymo. Until recently, their goal has been to attack the more tractable pure delivery market with a custom delivery robot about half the size of traditional cars. They received a large investment and hoped to be a delivery service company with their robots. Those robots, which have no place for a human driver, are among the few vehicles to operate without human supervision on public streets in the USA, and indeed the world. They recently announced the plan to pivot towards licencing their self-driving design to partners who want to do robotaxi, delivery or other applications, rather than do it themselves. Uber, most people know, is top brand in selling rides as a service, except in Asia. They do it with semi-independent human drivers. After a failed effort to develop their own self-driving system, which was traded to Aurora for stock, they have recently been booking rides for Waymo and have announced partnerships with several companies developing robotaxis, including VW/MOIA/MobilEye, Momenta, Motional, May and to some degree with WeRide, Baidu, Volvo, AVRide and as noted, Aurora. In this case though, they are making multi-hundred-million dollar investmants in both Lucid and Nuro. Lucid will build the vehicles, integrating Nuro’s hardware design into the vehicles. Uber will own them and operate them and integrate them into the Uber app. Lucid is known as a high-end EV maker, though at modest volumes. Their stock saw major gains with this announcement. Lucid has a reputation for quality, and they are one of the very few to create a new car company in the USA recently, but as a luxury OEM, they are to some degree the odd one out in this trio. The partnership calls for the production of at least 20,000 cars over the next 6 years (Lucid currently makes about 10,000 per year but is growing.) Nuro’s role is fairly clear. They have the software stack and hardware design. The actual hardware components are largely off-the-shelf including the NVidia Thor processor, and cameras, radars and LIDARs from different suppliers. For now, the software stack is the key component of a robotaxi. While there are many other components, including hardware, vehicles, infrastructure, or the network of riders and app that Uber has, these are not trivial but they are not the rare rocket science ingredient. A software stack ready to deploy in public with sufficient safety takes a lot of work and time, working through a very long tail of problems. It’s not easy to duplicate--or so Nuro hopes. Since the robotaxi business is the business of selling rides, Uber’s market-leader position is also unique, though the actual components, like the app and the backend, have been built by many companies and aren’t that hard to recreate. Building vehicles to spec is a capability found all over the world, though doing it at scale for low cost is harder. Right now, vehicle hardware cost is not super important for robotaxi developers. Most of them have a literal laser focus on making their system work safely, and reducing cost in the future will be work but requires no breakthroughs. Only Tesla and some lower-funded startups have cared a lot about cost. Now that companies are scaling, the view on that will change. Right now Waymo uses expensive Jaguars, but they planned to switch to low-cost Zeekrs, a plan that may be scuttled by tariffs. They’re also working with more mid-priced Hyundai Ioniq 5s. Tesla plans a dedicated Cybercab which takes advantage of the fact that a robotaxi needs far less hardware than a consumer human driven car, they say they will make it for under $30,000. Making cars is Tesla’s strong suit. Baidu claims their 6th gen vehicle has a hardware cost of $28,000--the Chinese are the best a low-cost car manufacturing. Amazon’s Zoox is making a more expensive custom built vehicle because they believe they can differentiate from competitors with the features found only in the custom vehicle, but in time and at scale it should be possible to make it cheaper. Right now, there’s no robotaxi competition. Companies either are alone in their territory, or they are not in active commercial operation with full fleets, so they’re not taking business from one another. The question is, when does that change, and when it does, on what do they compete, and how important are price and luxury? When companies begin to compete, the cost of the hardware will start to matter, because depreciation becomes the largest single component of the cost of a robotaxi ride. I estimate from 20-30% of the cost-of-goods sold. There are many factors in which robotaxi services will compete but the largest will be things like cost, wait time, service area and luxury of ride. Waymo's plan was a vehicle based on the Zeekr RT, which starts around $40,000, if not for tariffs. At the start, a luxury ride make sense. Why skimp, when you’re trying to make it work and keep customers happy, not improve margins. It’s a bit strange, though, because Nuro is touting how their new design with the Lucid saved a lot of money by replacing a lot of processing with the new Nvidia Thor--just to spend it on the Gravity, which typically sells around $100,000. But later this decade they will compete, and margins will matter. It’s an open question if, when competing, offering luxury will be important or if price will matter most. Nuro’s deal with Lucid doesn’t require that all 20,000 cars ordered be the Gravity, so in future a lower cost vehicle could come, though Lucid doesn’t currently make one. Nuro also says that because the Gravity is an electric, mostly drive-by-wire vehicle, it already has a fair bit of the hardware and redundencies they want in a design, and this reduces some costs. Uber may place the Lucid in their UberSelect or UberBlack categories, which are pricier than regular UberX, but command higher fees. They are, based on most reports, a much smaller fraction of rides than UberX. Most Uber riders are price-conscious. The picture is blurry, but now we can see some plans that players for the competition that will come later in this decade: All of this is in flux and subject to change. Indeed, in spite of Nuro’s announcement of ordering 20,000 Lucid vehicles, there have been many declarations of large orders from other companies, including Waymo, that were just aspirations, and never came to pass.

Christiaan Hetzner is a former writer for Fortune, where he covered Europe’s changing business landscape. Tesla shares sold off overnight and Wednesday morning after CEO Elon Musk scrapped his full-year guidance, warned upcoming quarters could prove rough, and hosted an earnings call once again long on promises and short on specifics. The stock was down 9% this morning at the open. Just over a month ago, the company launched its maiden robotaxi fleet in Austin. The new flagship service crystallized over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence and is meant to be definitive proof the EV maker is now an AI and robotics company. Yet four weeks later, Tesla has little to show for it. Just 7,000 driverless miles have been logged, Musk’s team revealed in the quarterly call. That works out to 20 miles per car per day, on average. Shares held steady in after-hours trading following the release of widely expected weak Q2 results that included an 89% drop in net cash generated. But they dipped lower as the earnings call drew to a close with little in the way of answers. They were nearly 6% down as trading began in New York. “Investors were searching for something and not hearing it,” wrote Gene Munster, cofounder of Deepwater Asset Management and longtime Tesla bull, who counted himself among the disappointed. “I wanted to hear more details about how the master plan will advance in the near term.” The call was Musk’s first opportunity to present shareholders with a clear road map for his robotaxi service with concrete milestones that specified … Right now, he is charging a flat rate of $6.90, but most expect either a per-mile rate or a dynamic price similar to Uber. Another key question that went unanswered was when the company felt it would no longer be necessary to employ a human safety monitor in the front passenger seat. Right now, scaling is inhibited by the presence of an onboard babysitter needed to prevent freak occurrences, like the recent case in which a monitor had to stop a Tesla from running a railroad crossing as a train was approaching. Take this statement for example, in which Musk reaffirmed comments earlier this year that his autonomous ride-hailing service would expand to most of the country by year-end. “We’ll technically be able to do it. Assuming we get regulatory approvals, it’s probably addressing half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. But we are being very cautious, we don’t want to take any chances—we’re gonna go cautious. The service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will increase at a hyper-exponential rate.” That was one continuous answer. Broken down, Musk is arguing his four-week-old service that continues to operate with just around a dozen vehicles in one city will—in the course of only five months—expand in a way that is simultaneously both “very cautious” as well as “hyper-exponential.” “In the meanwhile, we’ll launch a service with a person in the driver’s seat just to expedite while we wait for regulatory approval,” said Tesla AI director Ashok Elluswamy on the call. But investors don’t want another Uber. For the business model to work, the human safety monitor needs to be removed from the car. Here as well there was no timetable—just the word “eventually” in the shareholder deck. None of this might be a problem were it not for Tesla’s struggling core car business. With vehicle sales down 13% through the first half, Musk on Wednesday scrapped his guidance but confirmed vehicle sales would definitely grow this year. Now the company says the “actual results will depend on a variety of factors.” Could a second straight year of declines be possible? In October, Musk was still promising a 20% volume increase minimum. The Tesla CEO also confirmed the low-cost model—effectively a cheaper Model Y—has been delayed. Volume production is now slated for the fourth quarter of this year. Until then, it wants to prioritize meeting demand from customers looking to buy a Tesla before the federal tax credit expires at the start of October. Starting that same month, however, the outlook begins to darken. “We probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk conceded, citing Q4, Q1, and potentially Q2 as well. Then the script should flip once its upcoming Cybercab is deployed in sufficiently large numbers in its robotaxi fleet in the latter half of next year financed in part with the $37 billion in cash Tesla holds on its balance sheet. Fortunately, the upfront costs shouldn’t be too expensive for Tesla to finance. The two-seater was conceived to cut corners on performance, only aiming for a “gentle ride.” Since it’s not really meant for private ownership, it doesn’t need the kind of expensive propulsion system or finely tuned chassis that can deliver the speed, agility, or handling of a typical Tesla. There were some positives in the Q2 results. Automotive gross margins, excluding CO2 regulatory credits, came in at 15%, a 40 basis point improvement over last year, giving investors hope the downward trend may finally be forming a bottom. Nor were the $439 million in regulatory credits needed for the group to earn a profit either, thanks in large part to record profits from its industrial-size Megapack batteries. Sold to utilities for managing sudden peaks in electricity demand, its stationary energy storage solution constitutes a business with gross margins double those of its larger car operations. Tesla also expanded its Cortex data center in Austin by nearly a third, and now has the equivalent of 67,000 Nvidia H100 AI training chips. Musk also said his company’s own proprietary AI inference chip is built into every Tesla car and will soon become so intelligent it presents a threat to U.S. national security should it end up in the wrong hands. Referring to his upcoming AI5 chip that follows the current HW4 generation, Musk said: “It’s so powerful we’ll have to nerf it to some degree for markets outside the U.S. because it blows way past the export restrictions.” But this wasn’t sufficient for the market. True, it is not unusual for the stock to sell off after a business update, since Tesla quarterly calls are often viewed as “buy the rumor, sell the fact” trades. The news that emerged Wednesday proved, however, lean pickings for shareholders still willing to pay 140 times next year’s consensus earnings to own the stock, especially since the equity story hinges so heavily on the success of its maiden robotaxi fleet. “Investors were hungry for clear expectations about how many vehicles are on the road in Austin today and what it will end the quarter at,” Deepwater’s Munster added. “They wanted to hear that the company expects the human supervisor to be removed during the quarter or that the service will shift from being invite-only to public availability.” That hunger was not sated. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course.

Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode.

As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Unlike legacy dairy companies with large liquid milk exposure, Milky Mist has consciously built its business around high-margin products like paneer, cheese, curd, and yogurt. As of FY25, value-added products contributed a significant portion of its ₹2,350 crore topline, which has grown at a 30% CAGR over the last three years. However, profitability has been volatile. PAT dropped from ₹27.2 crore in FY23 to ₹19.4 crore in FY24, before rebounding to ₹46.1 crore in FY25—impacted by higher depreciation and finance costs from recent capacity investments. The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.6% in FY25. Operationally, the Perundurai plant runs at 110% utilization for paneer, reflecting both efficiency and potential capacity strain. 98% of milk procurement still comes from Tamil Nadu, posing concentration risk. The IPO proceeds aim to expand whey and yogurt capacity, reduce debt, and strengthen distribution through branded refrigeration units. In a sector known for supply chain complexity and margin compression, Milky Mist’s execution-led strategy offers visibility. However, scaling beyond South India while maintaining product quality and procurement control will be critical post-listing.” Drug maker Lupin on Thursday said it has received approval from the US health regulator to market generic medications to treat diabetes. The company has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its abbreviated new drug applications for Liraglutide Injection single-patient-use prefilled pens and glucagon for injection vials, the drug maker said in a statement. Lupin receives USFDA approval for generic diabetes medications, including Liraglutide Injection and Glucagon for Injection. India’s electricity demand is projected to triple by 2035, reaching over 4,000 TWh, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, digital infrastructure, and the electrification of transport. Meeting this surge will require a massive scaleup in generation capacity across renewables like Solar and Wind, thermal, and nuclear, alongside robust transmission and distribution upgrades. This report outlines the estimated capital investment needed to build a resilient, sustainable, and future-ready power ecosystem. Here are key pointers from our analysis: According to the NEP, solar is expected to contribute 40% of India’s installed capacity by 2032—a figure we project to slightly increase to 41% by 2035, reflecting continued momentum in solar deployment. Coal’s share, which NEP estimates at 29% by 2032, is projected to decline further to 24% by 2035 in our analysis, consistent with India’s decarbonization goals and the growing dominance of renewables. Wind energy, which NEP places at 13%, is expected to rise significantly to 21% by 2035, capturing a portion of coal’s declining share and contributing to grid diversification. Other sources such as hydro, nuclear, and biomass remain relatively stable in both projections, supporting baseload and regional reliability. This alignment with NEP validates our methodology and also highlights the strategic direction India is taking toward a cleaner, more balanced energy future. “We have started FY26 on a strong note with sustained growth across all key parameters.

The solvency ratio stood at 2.08, well above the regulatory requirement demonstrating strong financial stability. SBI General Insurance continues to lead the Personal Accident (PA) segment, maintaining its position as the No. 1 private insurer. The company gained market share in the key categories of Health by 72 bps , Motor by 47 bps and Personal Accident by 49 bps. The Health and Motor Insurance lines of business remain key growth drivers, while other segments, such as Fire, Engineering, and Liability, have also contributed significantly to the growth.

The firm expects the rupee to strengthen to 84 per U.S. dollar by the final quarter of calendar year 2025. Barclays, meanwhile, argues the rupee’s decline over recent months is “reaching limits over the short term,” and recommends fading any weakness around 86.50-87.00 levels. - Reuters Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. has received tentative approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its Ibrutinib tablets in 140 mg, 280 mg, and 420 mg strengths.

(PTI) The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has approved a phased rollout of market coupling across India’s power exchanges, beginning with three months of pilot run. The decision shifts price-setting responsibilities from individual exchanges to a central body, a development that may hurt Indian Energy Exchange, which currently handles the bulk of trade volumes and plays a key role in price discovery. The Commission has asked the Grid Controller of India to start with pilot testing of three mechanisms: coupling the Real-Time Market (RTM) across all exchanges, coupling the RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, and coupling the Day-Ahead Market. The change is aimed at improving market efficiency, but it reduces the commercial price discovery role of exchanges like IEX in determining prices. Since IEX earns most of its revenue from high-volume trading in the Day-Ahead Market and Real-Time Market segments, the shift could affect its position and profitability.

Full Content:
On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we might need an ‘App Store 3.0’ reset. Top Takeaways: 🕹️ The 1980s: Apple’s developer DNA was born Apple’s earliest wins came from nurturing third-party developers, even spinning off its own apps to avoid competing with outsiders. 💸 Microsoft saved Apple (literally) Apple’s near-bankruptcy in the ’90s made them both humble and wary—forever shaping how they deal with developers and competition. 🍎 From “please build for us” to “we choose you” WWDC 2008 saw Apple begging for apps and evangelist emails on slides; today, it’s the other way around. 🖥️ The “Delicious Era” fueled iPhone success Mac indie devs (Panic, Delicious Monster, Bare Bones) built a design-obsessed, passionate community—setting the stage for the iPhone App Store boom. 🚪 App Store 1.0: A new world for indies For the first time, solo developers could launch businesses from home. No server costs, no payments hassle—just build, submit, and sell. 🏦 Apple’s rules got stricter as the App Store grew As the App Store became a services giant, the partnership vibe faded. Developers went from partners to “users” of Apple’s marketplace. 📉 App Store math now feels upside down Today, indie devs can pay Apple millions, while giants like Meta pay almost nothing. The fee logic and incentives don’t fit 2025. ⏳ The platform needs an “App Store 3.0” reset John and David call for a new era: lower fees, clearer rules, and Apple acting as a true platform partner—not just a toll booth. 🔄 Developer enthusiasm is Apple’s long-term moat Apple risks becoming a “legacy only” giant if it loses developer goodwill. The most important apps are still built by outsiders. 👥 A generational handoff is coming With Apple’s senior leadership nearing retirement, now is the time to set new priorities: empower developers, invest in the ecosystem, and ensure Apple’s platforms stay vibrant for decades to come. Resources: Follow us on X: David Barnard: Welcome to the Sub Club Podcast, a show dedicated to the best practices for building and growing app businesses.

My guest today is John Gruber, Raconteur, Apple aficionado, podcast host and sole proprietor of Daring Fireball. On the podcast, I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year history of Apple's developer relations, how almost going bankrupt in the '90s shaped today's control-focused approach and why we might need an App Store 3.0 reset. Hey, John, thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. John Gruber: Well, you've been on my show. I hope to have you on my show again soon, so it's the least I can do. I'm happy to be here. David Barnard: So today, I want to talk Apple Kremlinology, which I think is maybe a great term. I just threw it out there. Apple is such a unique organization that... And for most developers, it's like our most important partner. And I'm doing air quotes for those listening on the podcast. And I don't think a lot of people understand Apple, and I think a lot of how people interact with Apple, what they think of Apple is shaped by just not understanding them, which is maybe on Apple. But that's what I wanted to talk about today was better understanding Apple. And I think of all the people to have this conversation with, it's going to be really fun to have it with you. John Gruber: I appreciate that and only because, and I hate to flatter myself. I really do. I really do. I try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like that's what keeps me in the game. But understanding Apple to me is maybe one of the top three things I have. I really.... David Barnard: Yeah. Yeah, totally. John Gruber: And there's always been an intuitive, oh, I love this company vibe fit and some other rolls of the dice of the way my life could have worked out surely on many of the other rolls of the dice. I end up working at Apple for some amount of time, possibly a very short amount of time, because every time I've ever had a job in my life where I actually am not self-employed has not lasted all that long. So probably not long, but one of my earliest memories, I think it was either fifth or sixth grade, which was early '80s, probably like 1983, '84, I just remember reading a story about Apple Computer and I knew at the time that I liked Apple Computers better than other company's computers, and I loved computers. But I remember reading a story about the company and reading that all of the employees just show up to work in sneakers and jeans and T-shirts and that they wear clever T-shirts and they make. Every time they start a new project, the first job is to print up T-shirts for the team for the new project, and then they wear them to work. And I remember thinking, that's awesome because I don't want to wear a freaking suit and tie to work. And I remember telling my dad this and my dad telling me, "John, there is no way that a major computer company lets the people show up to work in jeans and T-shirts." And I was like, "No, I'm telling you, dad, I read it in a magazine. It's true." David Barnard: That's awesome. And then not to flutter myself, but while we're... We should have scripted this, and I should have done this for you and you should have done this for me, but I relied on ChatGPT pretty heavily to do research for the show because I wanted to go really in-depth in the history of Apple and their relationships with developers. And last night, I'm getting through my notes and ChatGPT says, "Three of the prominent voices in App Store related topics are John Gruber, Ben Thompson and David Barnard." And I don't know if it knew it was me and was freaking trying to flatter me or whatever, but I mean, similar to you in a way that the App Store is something I'm unreasonably passionate about. I have an emotional attachment to the App Store and care so deeply about it. And in part, and you know I've discussed this, I was a recording engineer and I knew that was kind of a dead end as far as having a family and being able to provide and stuff like that. But I was a huge Apple nerd, so I got a 17-inch PowerBook in 2003. So my Apple journey begins a little later. I mean, I used them in college and I played with a original Mac in the '80s, but my real Apple fanboyism started in 2002, 2003. So I jumped right into the App Store in 2008 thinking, "Okay, this is an opportunity to build a real career that's going to provide for my family." And it did. I'm 17 years into owning an app business and I care so deeply about the store and then also care so deeply about Apple. And so everything we're going to talk about today, it's like you being one of the people who cares the most about Apple, who's outside Apple, and me, one of the people who cares the most about the App Store outside of Apple, I think is the two right people to have this kind of conversation. And maybe we should have had Ben on and to have a third voice, but... John Gruber: There are certain things that I just remember which years they were, and I just remember that 2007 iPhone no App Store, 2008 App Store comes out. 2009, it really takes off and coincides really with the go-go years of Twitter. And that's absolutely 100%, there's no confusion. I mean, maybe you sent me an email at daringfireball.net or something, but where I remember getting to know you was on Twitter, and I just remember like it's one of the great privileges of my position doing what I do with Daring Fireball where it's like, "Oh, I'm going to get to know this guy," and we'd at each other on Twitter about App Store issues, but I was like, "This guy," I could sense both your profound enthusiasm for it and the way that it was making you... It wasn't making a fanboy of the App Store where no matter what you wanted to say, "Oh, I love the App Store. So no matter what, I'm going to make my conclusion, whatever changes they make are great." Your enthusiasm was such that you're like, "I want to understand every single thing about this to the deepest degree." And again, it's sort of like a laziness where I'm like, "Oh, if I become friends with this guy," and I've got a Rolodex of people who are experts on whatever, it could be AppKit, could be UIKit, could be the App Store, could be... And you're at the top of the list for the App store and have been since 2009 and probably should have been since 2008. But I just remember, 2009, you were just a key follow on Twitter for App Store related stuff, and it was such a fascinating time, explosive, just an explosive time. David Barnard: Well, and I was a Gruber fanboy, and you linking to my app in the fall of 2008, I think wasn't part of turning point. I mean, they were key people who helped me along the way, including people inside Apple. And I remember vividly... John Gruber: It was the Launcher app, right? What was it called? David Barnard: No, no, no, this was 2008. You linked to my mileage logging app. When the App Store launched, there was this terrible Windows phone ish, horrible user interface, no kind of Mac or iOS interface paradigm, a mileage log. They got there first, which is still eats me to this day. 17 years later, I missed the launch of the App Store because Apple did not approve my developer account. And so a month later, I release a mileage log, it was like we follow the iOS paradigms, I mean, looking back, I don't ever feel like I had the best taste, but I didn't have... It was brown and it was not the prettiest or most, but it was iOS. We used the paradigms of iOS. We built a native app. And so you link to that in the fall of 2008, and it was a turning point. John Gruber: Well, I'm happy, I remember that. And that was the other thing that I remember about you is it wasn't just that you were obsessive about the App Store, is that you actually had skin in the game, and that you clearly... Again, I'm not just trying to butter you up here, but no, but there was at that time, at the very highest level when they first announced the iPhone and said, "Hey," and underneath it was one of the... It wasn't called a Bento box at the time. They did the slides in a different style. But at Steve Jobs original introduction, they had a bunch of things on a slide and they said Cocoa, that everything Apple had done for the original iPhone, before the iPhone, before the App Store, and before they announced, famously took them several months before they said, "Okay, we're going to do an SDK," but they said that they were using Cocoa. There's like a five-minute podcast Merlin Mann did at Macworld Expo talking to me and Jason Snell, the day of the keynote on the floor, it was like a five-minute interview with me and Snell by Merlin Mann. And Snell and I were like, "Apple didn't say much about this Cocoa thing, but presumably at some point, it's just probably not ready yet. They're going to open up APIs and this is going to be huge." I mean, this was hours after the keynote when we were still euphoric about the whole thing because everybody was sort of looking forward to just an iPod phone, right? David Barnard: Right. John Gruber: And it was so much more, it felt like my mind had gotten significantly bigger during the keynote. My brain had grown because the realm of possibility of personal computing was suddenly much larger than I thought. But in that initial moment, most developers were thinking was, "Well, that's fantastic if they're Xocoa APIs," and UIKits slightly different than AppKit, but every single AppKit going back to next developer I know looked at the initial UIKit APIs and was like, "Oh, all right, this is different, but I know this, this is very familiar." But the idea that developers had was how do you take ideas that are good Mac apps and put them on the phone? And for many apps, that was a great idea and Apple itself did that, right? Safari, mail, how do you take mail and make a version that fits on the phone? But the opportunity that I think Mac developers didn't think of right away is what sort of ideas only make sense for a phone, a little pocket, 3.5 inch screen device that's with you all the time. That wouldn't make sense on a Mac and a mileage tracker is exactly that sort of idea. That's what I remember hitting me about that app in 2008. Like, oh, this would be stupid on the Mac. What are you going to do? Take your MacBook or PowerBook? I forget what, I guess they were MacBook set by 2008, but what are you going to do? Take a laptop with you in your car everywhere and log your gas and mileage? No, but for something that would replace what you would've done in a pocket notebook, that's a perfect idea. Obviously, people want this. And that's where I feel like you were ahead of me and I'm like, "I got to follow this guy because he's thinking about things that are phone first." David Barnard: Right. Yeah. Well, enough navel-gazing. I'm blushing. But I appreciate all of that. And again, just the perfect person to have this kind of conversation with, which I've wanted to have this conversation for a while in service of the community of... In my day job at RevenueCat, and I do still build apps on the side, so I'm still an indie developer, I was looking at my LinkedIn the other day and 17 years at Contrast and still going strong, still running my weather app on the side and stuff. So at my day job at RevenueCat, I interface with a ton of developers and a lot of them don't care one lick about Apple, in fact, I mean, the growing hostility, people who've never built an app before will book an office hours call with me and say, "Screw Apple, screw them in their 30%." There's no care for Apple as a company or the products or anything like that. And so I wanted to do this podcast to give some of that history. I was actually thinking as I was preparing these notes, it's almost a book at some point, the history of the App Store and how it shaped the world. I mean, so many decisions that Apple made, big and small, literally did shape how things happen, and we'll get into some of that. But I wanted to step all the way back, and again, in doing the research for this over the weekend, I saw something that really surprised me, and I think I knew this, but I hadn't seen the numbers. And that is that the three top executives at Apple whose teams work on the app store. So I think maybe, and Apple is famously secretive about who does what and who reports to who and those kinds of things. But from my understanding... John Gruber: They're secretive about everything, David. David Barnard: Everything, yeah. Yeah. Something like 90% of the people who interface with developers in the App Store who work on the App Store report up to three executives. Greg Joswiak, who joined Apple in 1986. John Gruber: Yeah, I think right out of college. He went to University of Michigan and went right to Apple. David Barnard: Phil Schiller, who joined Apple in 1987, and Eddy Cue who joined Apple in 1989. And so to really understand Apple and how they interact with developers and how they receive the developer community, you really do have to go all the way back to the 1980s when these three key executives joined and started, and each of them have their different role in developer relations over time. But going back to that 1984 release of the Mac and these early days of developer relations between Apple and developers, I think is so fascinating, and one of the things, again, I didn't eve... I knew, but seeing it again in black and white, just how instrumental Microsoft was in those early days to Apple that two years ahead of the 1984 release of the Mac, Microsoft had agreed to build products for this new platform. And then specifically, and again, never heard this before, but Bill Gates was kind of an Apple fanboy in some of the early days before they got really contentious. And I read this history piece about the history of Apple that said Gates would show up to events, Macworld and other events with Macintosh shirts, he would wear a Macintosh. I mean, can you even imagine Bill Gates in the '80s wearing Macintosh T-shirt? It was just such a different era. But then over time, developer relations started to get a bit contentious. What do you remember? I mean, you were, gosh, like 6, 8, 10 at the time when all this happened. And I was five. But we both read a lot about the history. So what do you recall? And then what do you remember from having read upon all this. John Gruber: Too young to have experienced those years extemporaneously, but from what I've read, one of the key superpowers that Gates had, and I think it's true, I think this is not an original observation, but no matter how big, and no matter even... I mean, I guess eventually after, when you get closer to 50 years, which Apple and Microsoft are at, but maybe closer to a century after entire original generations have clearly all died off, it fades away. But all companies in all fields are just infused with the personalities of their founders. And one of the things that Gates infused in Microsoft was an amazing willingness or just natural ability. I don't even think it was something he did purposefully. I think it's just the way his mind worked is he was always thinking what could be and was not attached to the way things were. The whole name Microsoft, the whole idea that revolution of the company was, "Hey, we could make a company." This was him and Paul Allen that just focuses on software and had no plans in those early days to make their own computer. And all of the action in the late '70s at that moment of the PC revolution, the late '70s and the early '80s was on the company's making computers, Apple and Commodore and Texas Instruments, you name it, IBM, once they made the PC and Microsoft's key insight was, "Hey, software is incredibly valuable." And at the time, that idea alone was revolutionary. It was absolutely revolutionary because everybody else thought the only thing that matters is computers and computers were all absurdly expensive. Just look at the memory that was in those computers. The Commodore 64 was called the 64, not because it was 64 bit, but because it had 64 kilobytes of RAM, right? That was the 64, and it wasn't cheap, cheap. And the idea was software, you just copy, it was just ones and zeros. You could just make copies. And the idea that no, no software is worth paying for was a revolution. And I think that's why Gates could have such incredible enthusiasm for something like some other company's computer because everything they did was for somebody else's computer. They didn't make computers and they didn't really have a platform. And so I think Gates recognized early that Apple made better computers and that they were onto something. And he clearly, from the outset, had the mindset of the complete opposite of, I forget his name, but the 1960s era, IBM CEO who said, "I think there's a market in the world for six or seven computers." Because the thinking in that era was, well, the US military will want one, maybe like the US IRS, and there'll be one great supercomputer for universities to share. Whereas Gates was really thinking early on, "Oh no, there should be computers in every house." But he wasn't thinking that Microsoft would own a platform. But then when the opportunity came with DOS and they saw the opportunity they had by owning MS-DOS and being the company that provided it, it changed their thinking completely to instead of, oh, we'll make software for anybody's computer. We're going to make a platform and we'll still make some software for other platforms, but we really want to steer everybody to our platform even though we don't make the computers. David Barnard: One of the interesting footnotes in this as well is that Apple had a similar idea of we're building this platform, we need to make sure there's software on it. And so they built Mac, right? MacPaint, MacDraw, and a bunch of other apps. And again, something I didn't realize until doing all this research was that in 1986, they stopped bundling those because it was competitive with third-party developers. And man, I mean, these days with sherlocking and Apple building an app for everything, I mean, even most recently building an invite app like building a sports app, Apple has over the last 17 years of the App Store gone deeper and deeper and further and further into competing directly with third-party developers. But back here in the '80s, they were like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't want to squash the potential for third-party developers to build for this platform that we have. So these apps that we built for our own platform that we have previously bundled," I mean, again, at some point maybe when Schiller or Jos or one of these guys retires, we'll do this again and get the inside scoop on some of the deeper thinking behind this. But they stopped bundling, and then in 1987, they spun all those apps off into Claris, a subsidiary of Apple to have them at little bit more of an arm's length. It's specifically to not interfere with third-party developers. And it's still fascinating to go all the way back to the '80s and see such a different Apple that they recognized the power of developers in the platform and were actively doing things at that time to make sure they didn't compete. They didn't make it a non-starter for people to build these kind of apps for the Macintosh platform, which is just fascinating. John Gruber: And it was about a decade, I would say maybe '86, '87, and those are the years where I was there as a teenager into college, and '86 to '95, '96 or so was the decade where Apple was very hands-off about first-party apps and it made sense. And one of the areas of contention, it's sort of like a heartbreak, and I forget the exact details. I know Andy Hertzfeld's wonderful, wonderful... I think there's a story about it on Folklore.org, but you can look it up. But there were two basics, the basic programming language for the Mac in the very early '80s and Apple Basic was much better and could let you do Macintosh-like things like pop open a dialog box, which you think like, well, of course, why would you want to have a programming environment for the Mac that couldn't pop open a dialog box? But that was revolutionary at the time, and Microsoft had their basic, and as like a, let's keep Microsoft happy, Apple sort of squashed their own in-house basic, which was a much better programming environment for the Macintosh. So as not to step on the toes of Microsoft Basic, which was more of a oh, character based sort of text interface basic, where you could write the same Microsoft Basic program and run it on the Mac and run it on any other computer that had Microsoft Basic. And that's just one example of that sort of thinking and this sort of thing that led them to spin off the initial, which they had to do again because nobody knew how to write these graphical user interface programs. It often comes up and people, you have to Google the images to believe it, but the original Macintosh keyboard didn't have arrow keys because they wanted to force developers and users to use the mouse as opposed to almost all other computers at the time didn't even have mice. So there was the Macintosh, which had a mouse and other computers which had no pointer interface, just a keyboard interface. So you'd be like, "What do you want to do in the computer?" And it would present a text menu and you'd use arrow keys to go up and down. I want to open existing file down. I want to create a new file down. I want to manage my files up, down, left, right. So to force developers to make programs that were mouse driven, mouse pointer driven. Apple didn't even put arrow keys on the original Macintosh keyboard, which imagine the frustration editing text now. So if you wanted to, you could backspace, there was a delete key, but if you wanted to go back a word or two, you had to go take your hands off the keyboard, go to the mouse and click where you wanted to go. But I understand why that didn't last, but I also understand the thinking at the time to break people's habits because as much as they thought this is a computer for the rest of us, which was their slogan, and this will be the way that most people in the future learn to use computers. Right now, the market is people who already know how to use computers, but what they know from the existing computers isn't the way this computer works. And so they had to make apps like MacWrite and MacPaint and MacDraw, and then two years in, they're like, "Ah, we're kind of squashing the market. What we really need is a thriving third party market, so let's go hands off." And then for the next decade, the Mac really didn't have many first party programs. If you just went to the store and bought a brand new Macintosh in 1991 or '92, you got TextEdit or it was called SimpleText at the time. There were very few apps that were built in. There was no built-in Contacts app. You didn't have all these things that you would think, "Oh, how do you have a computer without an address book?" Well, the idea was that whole thing was a third party opportunity. David Barnard: And this is a great example of why I wanted to have this conversation, and maybe we'll pull on some of these threads as we go through. One thing to understand about Apple and how they operate today is that they've had success in doing those sorts of things. And so when you look at Apple TV that famously launched, and Apple tried to get people to develop games for it, but you could only use the Apple remote, and it was Apple as with the keyboard not having arrow keys, it was, we don't want people to require a gaming controller to build games, so we're going to force them to use remote. And games sucked, and I was so pissed at Apple, it took them, what, three or four years to finally enable controller support. And by that time, it was just so clear that Apple TV was not going to be a gaming platform, maybe could have been more of a gaming platform had they done it, maybe it was the right choice, whatever. And then look at the Vision Pro. Two years ago, I was so frustrated that Apple didn't release motion track controllers like what you have on the Meta Quest, but why did they do that? It goes all the way back to 1984 and not having the arrow keys, it was, "Hey, we're introducing a new user interface paradigm, a new user experience, and we want to force developers to build apps that use hand gestures and eye tracking and not controllers." Now, two years later, they just announced at WABC that PlayStation VR controller support in Vision Pro, but this is two years after the fact, and I was so frustrated two years ago. But this is one of those things when you look back, you better understand why they make the decisions they make. They have a long history of making those kinds of decisions going all the way back to the '80s and forcing developers into the path that they think is best for the platform is just so fascinating. John Gruber: I keep repeating it. I'm more bullish on visionOS as a platform than most commentators, and I keep drawing the analogy to the original Macintosh, the original Macintosh in 1984, I know the number off the top of my head because I bring it up all the time. It was $2,500, which inflation adjusted is give or take right now, like $7,200. There was only one config. There was no option to get more RAM. There was no storage, you used floppy drives. So $2,500, it was 7,200 equivalent today about twice the cost of a Vision Pro, very expensive. It's sold so poorly and so under their expectations that it was the impetus for driving jobs out of the company. And in the whole, people don't know the history, like how in the world did Apple kick Steve Jobs out of the company? The real reasons were mostly personality conflicts, and that yes, of course, he did not work well when there was somebody else, John Sculley from Pepsi as the CEO who Jobs, the founder, ostensibly reported to, of course, Jobs did not work well as anything but the CEO, and that's ultimately the reason. But in terms of going to the board and having reasons other than this guy's a pain in my ass, to force him out, the sales of the Mac were the... And again, it was expensive and Apple couldn't really afford the fact that it was a bit of a flop in 1984, 1985, but the PC press of the time took it as, "Hey, this whole graphical user interface thing, it's clever, but it's a gimmick. This isn't how real computer users want to use a computer. Nobody wants to take their hands off the keyboard and use a mouse all the time. It's a waste of memory to be drawing all these windows and stuff like this." That was all proven wrong. The Mac was the right idea for the future of personal computing, but it needed at least four or five years before you're like, "Holy, shit, this is like a thriving platform that's revolutionizing certain industries like desktop publishing." David Barnard: Yeah. And as a 40, almost 50-year-old company, I guess next year it's 50 years, somewhere around there. Apple's patience is remarkable. This is another thing that I continually get wrong, and I think a lot of people get wrong. 100% agree on the Vision Pro. It is a phenomenal piece of hardware. It is an incredible platform for experimenting with the future, even if it's flawed and even if there are problems. But Apple's patient, and clearly they have AR stuff in the labs that Cook and others have played with. There's been reporting recently about all Tim Cook thinks about is getting to this AR glasses future or whatever it might be. And the Vision Pro is that first step along the way, and Apple is very patient, as much as people pan it as few units as they sold, even if it's been less successful as they internally hope for, they are nothing if not a patient company that's going to keep plugging away at these things. Because look how it turned out for the Mac, like you said, it took four or five years. Well, I mean, we're two years into the Vision Pro. They've got time and they've got cash to wait around and they've got the experience of building these platforms over decades, not making sure something is a hit in months and days. John Gruber: This is only based on observation, but I think I almost see how can somebody refute this is that their thinking is basically if their projection of where a hit AR/VR, let's just put aside whether the first hit product in the category will be AR or VR, but it'll probably be AR, right? VR is just too weird where my definition of the difference, the broad difference here is if the device is off, powered off, can you see anything or do you see through glasses, right? If it's glasses that when the device is at 0% battery powered off, you still see through the lenses, that's AR. And if it's like Vision Pro where it's off, it's like blindfolds, that's VR, it's probably AR, but let's just say it doesn't matter. Put that aside, that it'll take till around 2030 to have a product at a price and a feature set and a battery life that's compelling to explode in popularity and that people will be like, "I got to get one of those." If it's 2030, when that's going to come out, what's the right way to approach the market? And I think the people who are laughing at Vision Pro and saying, "It's $3,500, nobody's bought one. They've only sold hundreds of thousands, not even a million, whatever." Apple should have waited until then to release a product, and then boom, here's the first thing. And the iPhone was sort of like that, right? And the iPhone was right out of the gate. Yes, it was a little more expensive, but the first iPhone was incredibly useful, totally credible device. And I know it didn't sell in great quantities compared to today's numbers, but as somebody who bought one, it was like, "Yeah, this is real." And it's not like I'm buying a product that hints at a future. The Vision Pro is not like that. The Vision Pro is not the iPhone in 2007. The Vision Pro today, I don't like calling it a dev kit, but it's like an enthusiast kit, which includes developers, but it's an enthusiast kit that you spend a ridiculous amount of money compared to a MacBook Air. You get a really good MacBook Air for $1,000, or you could get a really good MacBook Air for 1,300, $1,400. This is three times, four times more expensive and it's less essential to people's lives than their iPhone, which you can get a really good iPhone for seven, $800. It's different than that, but is the right strategy to wait until that hardware is out in 2030 and then start there with building a platform or is the right strategy to start building a platform around 2023, 2024, and when that hardware is finally available and there's a breakthrough in the technology and the price and the capabilities in the battery life that you've got five years of ecosystem and content behind it. All these complaints, again, I've complained too and I'm a little surprised, but they're getting there, just in terms of having entertaining immersive content, the things like the Bono video and the adventure climbing mountains and all this stuff. They've got some stuff, you would think with their budget that they could have more, but the idea of, hey, if they're going to sell this thing for all this money, shouldn't they have more content available? Well, if 2030 is when they think this is going to explode, think of how much content they're going to have in the library by then. And I think that's what they know. There are so many similarities between this and the Macintosh in 1984, but there are also so many profound differences because Apple is so big and so pervasive in popular culture and people's lives. And it breeds a different sentiment towards the company, which I think we're going to continue talking about with developer relations. But then on the other hand, their profound, almost unfathomable financial success gives them the liberty of saying, "We're going to make a seven-year bet that costs a lot of money," just in terms of this thousand or so software engineers who work on Vision stuff inside the company. We're going to make a profound bet to build this out over half a decade so that when the hardware's really there for a mass-market thing, we've got it. We've already got the platform, we've already got the UI paradigms nailed down, we've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be... John Gruber: ... nailed down. We've got the input, we've got the sensors. We're going to be there five years ahead of time. It's a very different way of thinking than a company that is sweating it out. Are we still going to be in business two quarters from now? David Barnard: Yeah, and I think that's part of the pushback is that too many people, especially in the press, continue to expect every product Apple releases to be the next iPhone. And the iPhone is just singular in history as a consumer electronic device that it was able to come out of the gate as such an incredible useful day one thing. Because even, and again, I mean, this is why we're having this conversation. You go back to 1984, the $2,500, which is $7,200 a day or whatever it is, was not a daily driver, this is changing my life, most productive thing in the world. It was a nice to have, it was an enthusiast, it was something to tinker with and maybe you find a few productivity things here and there that it benefits. Apple has done this decade after decade after decade, and they have that long vision. And again, going back to these execs who've been around through it all, it's like they've seen it happen and they know it will happen and they know it can happen. And to your point, they're not under that pressure of the Vision Pro has to be the iPhone. It doesn't have to be the iPhone. We've done this 10 times before with different products with transitioning from Power PC to Intel, with early days of iMac and it becoming a consumer hit that wasn't even the massive smash hit compared to the iPhone. And so it's like they know how to build platforms over decades and not over months and years that everybody else expects it to happen. John Gruber: So the one difference, and it is almost the same thing but along a different vector where I said about Gates and the way that Gates instilled in Microsoft a sort of flexibility in thinking like, hey, what's the opportunities right now? I think Satya Nadella's era as CEO embodies that where I feel like he came in and was like, you know what? We don't have to be all about Windows, Windows, Windows. We can go to more of a cloud first mindset and look at where they are financially and in cloud services and stuff. It's been a great deal for them, but that they got their institutional fortitude is once we have a hit, we will latch onto it and try to stick with it and ride it all the way down. And that was the whole mindset with Windows. Windows everywhere and they're going to put Windows on your TV set-top box and Windows phone, right? And they were trying to make smartphones years before the iPhone and literally they had a start menu in the lower left corner. It looked like Windows 95 but on a phone and it wasn't running Windows apps, but it was a mindset of bringing Windows mentality. Whereas Apple's mindset led by Steve Jobs was let's start from scratch. And as much as they wound up using the Cocoa APIs and made UI kit, it was only not because that was a starting point. It was like, okay, if we're going to do this, maybe we could fit a small version of the Mac kernel onto this device and we'll build it, but we're not going to have any compatibility. It's not going to be called the Mac phone. We're not going to have an Apple menu up in the upper left corner. We're going to rethink this whole thing from scratch. Apple has this sort of, if it's a new form factor, we're going to start with a new platform and that's a very different thinking, but at another level, just in terms of its capabilities, the reason the iPhone could debut in 2007 as a totally credible, you could buy one right now, the first one totally useful is that it's ultimately, and this is the unifying theme of the last five years of dithering with me and Ben Thompson, is that the biggest marketing shame of the entire industry is that we wasted the term personal computer on desktop and laptop computers in 1980 because the phone is ultimately the personal computer. And that's where everything was heading from the Apple One in 1977 until 2007. Everything was heading towards building something under $1,000 that fit in your pocket and had an interface that anybody could just use and that the input was just poking at it with your finger and it was all visual and it had wireless connection to a network that connected to the entire world. It was so science fiction from the perspective of 1978, 79, but within 30 years, that's where everything in those 30 years was heading. So when it launched, it was really the culmination of what we've called personal computers for 30 years, whereas Vision Pro is sort of like, let's do something all new and we have to sort of start from scratch. It's going to be way too expensive and heavy and limited and the battery's going to be a pain in the ass, but it's a totally new vector. David Barnard: Yeah, well, we've kind of gotten ahead of ourselves. I want to go all the way back to the eighties again. It's important to step through the history of these developer relations of what brought us even to the iPhone. So I'll speed through this. You and I could talk for five hours, but I don't think we should turn this into a five-hour podcast, so I'll speed through a little bit of this. But going all the way back to the eighties, PageMaker was a huge turning point. Third party app, some people have credited it as saving the Mac platform. That it was so important to digital publishing and this is where as a platform apps can revolutionize your platform. When you've built a and hardware and third party developers go nuts on it, they build new things and do things that you would've never done as a first party software closed ecosystem, it's only Apple and the Mac and we're the only ones building for it. You get this entire ecosystem of people building new things and PageMaker was one of those things that became so integral to the digital publishing world that it's credited as a third party app for saving the whole Apple Mac platform and then you get Illustrator for Mac in 87, you get Photoshop in 1990 and during this time I think Apple really recognizes that power of developers. Guy Kawasaki joined around that time. I forget exactly, I think he may have joined before the 1984 Mac, but he was the first software evangelist and developer evangelist. Again, in doing research for this and reading up on some of the history of this, I realized just how much a debt of gratitude in some ways I owe to Guy Kawasaki for me having a job today at Revenue is that he... This whole developer advocacy and people who aren't technical or... I mean, I'm mildly technical but really can promote these platforms. It goes all the way back to the eighties and Guy Kawasaki and Apple being so enthusiastic for third party developers. John Gruber: I know Guy a little, I feel like I should know him better. I feel like he sort of left this racket right around the time that I was becoming more prominent in this industry, but I've met him a few times, but I've read his books and the Macintosh Way, it's a great book if you can find a copy of it. When I joined Barebone Software, I worked at Bare Bones, the BB edit company from 2000 to 2002. It was the only mandatory reading before. It was like the entire employee onboarding process was you have to read Guy Kawasaki's the Macintosh Way, but arguably it was the Apple way and at the time though, because it was the only successful platform Apple had, the Macintosh and Apple were easily conflated, but I think that what Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the intersection of developers, users, and the platform maker and that combined the three could form a cohesive whole that everything... And formed a flywheel where it just kept benefiting everybody where users are happy and they're buying the devices, which helps the platform maker and that the more devices the platform maker makes, the bigger the market is for third party developers. And so third party developers make more and invest more in the platform and make more innovative software that makes users like, oh my God, look what PageMaker can do. Holy crap. And then the users buy more of the... And it just keeps going and going. David Barnard: Sounds a lot like the iPhone. John Gruber: Yeah, I think that the other thing that Guy Kawasaki really crystallized was the idea that you could be an important serious player professionally in this field without being a programmer or a designer even. You could be a professional user. I'm a writer and I have a computer science degree from college from long ago, so more technical than most users, but I get that mindset where kind of what I wanted to be was a professional user, by being an enthusiast and learning how everything works. And that was his evangelism. It wasn't evangelism in the sense of evangelizing a religion based on faith. It was more like a religion based on practical advantages, like hey, learn how to do these things, learn how the actual system works and you're going to have superpowers compared to people who do the same thing as you who don't understand how these computers work. One person can do the work of 10 people with a Macintosh, and it was true. David Barnard: I saw that guy has been doing the rounds on podcasts. You should definitely have them on your podcast at some point. That'd be one I would love to listen to, you and Guy talking through this for two hours. We're kind of breezing over it in five minutes here, but I think it would be a fascinating listen for you and Guy to kind of talk through that in more detail. But we did want to keep moving. So that was the kind of eighties and into the early nineties. But then what happened in the nineties I think is kind of pivotal to Apple's relationship with developers is that in the nineties, and you know this better than I, so you can fill in the details here, but hardware sales started to tank. Things started to get really rocky for Apple and they got to this point where third-party developers had so much power over Apple that if Adobe wasn't updating their apps on the Mac platform and simultaneously the Windows platform had taken off at that point where they were probably, I assume making way more money on the Windows platform. It was kind of the platform to be on during that time, but Apple desperately needed those third-party developers to continue building for the platform to keep the platform sustainable. And that all kind of culminated in 1997 with the famous Steve Jobs standing in an auditorium with a giant screen of Bill Gates behind him and Microsoft saving Apple. And again, people who haven't studied the history or been around or not old men like you and I couldn't even fathom that Microsoft saved Apple. Had Microsoft not done that, Apple would've gone bankrupt. So fill in some of the gaps there. What happened in the nineties and how did Apple get into this desperate point where third-party developers had so much power over them needing Microsoft to save the company. John Gruber: I think point one that gets overlooked a lot in the years where Jobs was exiled from Apple, who knows what would've happened. Maybe that was for the best that he went and founded... It worked out well for him to go found Next, struggle to make next a thing and then have Next in Apple. I always call it a reunification rather than an acquisition because it really is so obvious. I mean, Craig Federighi's first job out of college was at Next and it's like he left for a while, right? Scott Forstall, but where Apple got lost in those years, one of the ways, and I think I haven't seen a lot of people or a lot of books focus on it, was the sort of mindset in the early PC years, a company would come out with a new computer and the computer was the platform effectively, and there wasn't really this idea, there wasn't so much of you'd make the Commodore 64 and then when Commodore came out with the Commodore 128, I forget if you could run Commodore 64 programs, but it was sort of a new computer. It was like, ah, this is a different computer. And then Commodore came out with Amiga is sort of an overlooked thing in history and I know the panic guys were big Amiga fans and the Amiga had the video toaster was doing digital video editing way before any other computer platform. It had some amazing capabilities, but Commodore just exemplifies it. Commodore 64 was a hit, then the 128 not so much of a hit, then the Amiga, which was way more capable. But that every couple of years the idea was there'd be like a new thing and backwards compatibility was like a maybe and it would be like a mode, but basically you'd sort of come out with an all new thing every couple years as opposed to evolving a platform over decades. It just didn't enter Apple's mind. And so Apple had all of these failed next generation, what's going to come after the Macintosh things in the late eighties and especially the early nineties, Pink and Taligent, and it's all confusing and it would take forever to explain as opposed to what was an operating system and what was a company and what was a cross-platform like? Taligent was sort of a cross company thing with IBM where it was in addition to an operating system, they'd make a new platform and the power PC chip architecture sort of came out of that. And so it wasn't totally futile, but the idea wasn't to how do we keep evolving the Macintosh? It was what comes after the Macintosh. That's the fundamental flaw. And the Newton is laughed at in some ways and other ways people are like, oh man, they're sort of a decade ahead of in terms of you'd have a handheld thing in your hand with a touchscreen, but the most obvious problem with the Newton was that something handheld that needs ubiquitous wireless networking. And there wasn't even Wi-Fi at the time, let alone cellular. Palm Pilot was sort of more of a hit, but mostly because it was affordable. And people like me, I had one, I had a handspring visor and I liked it. In hindsight, there's a lot of younger people who probably vaguely have heard of Palm Pilots, but it wasn't that big a deal. At the time, people are like, oh, the Palm Pilot is what Apple should have made with the Newton. No, because even the Palm Pilot really wasn't that big of a hit and it didn't have any staying power because it didn't do networking, it didn't have a connection to the internet, even Wi-Fi, let alone cellular. That's really what a handheld needed. But the other thing about the Newton that was just as important to its failure was it really hardly related to the Macintosh at all. There was a Newton, I forget what it's called, Newton Sink Utility or something, and you connect a serial cable to your Mac and Newton, you could sync some things, but like I said earlier, there was no contact app on the Mac from Apple. So where did your Newton contacts go? The Newton had a contacts app because it was a personal digital assistant and they had all of these things about what comes after the Macintosh when what they should have clearly been thinking of is how do we move the Macintosh forward? And meanwhile, while Apple's core interest and at the top level of the company was interested on these big expensive, all-failed next generation, what comes after the Macintosh? There were people at Apple who were grinding away on the Macintosh, putting out system seven and then system 7.1, system 7.5 and sort of keeping the company alive financially because that's an actual platform that people were using and buying. And I think at the highest level, Apple was looking at that the way that the Macintosh part of the company was looking at the Apple II in the eighties. And for most of those mid to late eighties, Apple was staying alive financially through Apple II sales, not Macintosh sales. And they were thinking, that's what the Macintosh is doing now and we will get pink or Copeland or whatever this thing is. Copeland was a next generation Mac. That was where they started to get it through their head that, oh, what we really need to do is keep the Mac alive and come up with something. They just wasted half a decade of great still explosive new stuff coming out. The whole internet thing happened in the midst of that where there was no internet to speak of. I mean, the internet existed, but it was like a university type thing in 1991 and by 1993, 4, 5, it was like, oh, Netscape is a huge thing. Meanwhile, Microsoft was doing the opposite with Windows where they're like Windows One, nobody used, nobody even heard of Windows Two, nobody used, nobody heard of. Windows Three, now people are using it instead of DOS, but it was really clunky and awful and they're like, let's make a better one. Let's make one that steals interface ideas from Next where the buttons and stuff look 3D and have gray scale. And they were grinding away on making the thing that was sort of a hit just a little better every couple years. And Apple just lost half a decade in that period. And thankfully they had people who were incrementally making the Macintosh better, but then they'd sort of painted themselves in a corner where the Macintosh operating system, not to get too super nerdy, but was still fundamentally based on some assumptions from the mid-eighties about how low level all software worked and the idea of preemptive multitasking where a program crashing couldn't possibly crash the whole computer because it would just be the program. Whereas the Macintosh was so low level and all programs sort of made some low level assumptions where they were, there was no kernel to speak of in computer science terms in that classic macOS. And they were doing things with low level memory where like, hey, if Internet Explorer froze up, your whole computer might just freeze. And then you had to literally use the power button on the hardware to restart it and anything you had open that wasn't saved was gone. In 1984, 85, 86, that's the way a computer like the Macintosh had to work. There was no option to do preemptive multitasking and have memory safe applications in that era because of the constraints of the hardware. But by 1995, 96, that was totally possible and it was obviously the way it should be, but there was no simple way to just say that's how the next version of macOS is going to work. And all of the existing apps like Photoshop and Excel and Microsoft Word will just work. There was no way. It was too incompatible. And that's what you were talking about earlier where Apple was up against it because the only reason the Macintosh was thriving was because of these apps from companies... And the big ones were Adobe and Microsoft, and if their existing apps didn't continue to work, there was no way anybody was going to upgrade to whatever they came up with no matter what its technical capabilities. David Barnard: And so then being back against the wall and Jobs having gone off to Next and built that next iteration, the Next revolution in computing the foundation for everything we do today was what Jobs built at Next, they acquired Next in 96 and Jobs comes back and then that's what leads up to this Microsoft committing to the platform, investing money into Apple. And then I wanted to read a quote, and this is going to be long, and those of you who really care can go back and watch. There's a video of this is that at WWDC in 1997. There's a quote from Jobs. A developer asked about OpenDoc, so I [inaudible 00:55:54] all this, but we can skip over the details of it because I think the details are less important, but Apple decided to kill this technology, OpenDoc and the developer very frustrated, goes up to the mic at WWDC during an open mic session with Steve Jobs at WWDC in 97. Very frustrated, why are you killing this thing? We've invested a lot of money into it and I want to read the quote. I kind of jump around in the quote because it would take 10 minutes to read, but let me read this quote from Steve Jobs because I think it's just so fascinating. "I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of, I apologize, I feel your pain." I wanted to get that in there because can you imagine Apple in 2025 saying, I apologize, I feel your pain and just the rest of this is so good. John Gruber: I can imagine it, but it would be very surprising and I feel like that's exactly what they could use, but yes. David Barnard: Yeah, that's what we're going to get to and that's why I wanted these quotes. We'll come back to it maybe an hour from now when we get deeper into the iPhone stuff. So continuing, it's skipping around the quote, but "focusing is about saying no. Focusing is about saying no and you've got to say no, no, no. And when you say no, you off people. So you take your lumps and Apple has been taking their share of lumps for the past six months in a very unfair way, and it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that." Man, Steve Jobs off the cuff. I miss that. I miss that so much. "And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." So again, that's missing a lot of context. It's missing a lot of the actual quote. You can go back and watch the video. I'll put it in the show notes, but I just thought that was so fascinating that Apple in '97 was at this point that Steve Jobs of all people was there on stage answering this kind of question with a level of kind of humility and self-awareness that, "Hey, developers are so important. I feel your pain. I'm sorry, I apologize. But then also clearly talking to the future of like, hey, this is going to be hard, but we're building towards something." And they included that quote specifically from what you were alluding to is that in this forty-year history with developers, there have been moments like that where you see a more open Apple, a more contrite Apple, and that the success of the iPhone has really changed the way I feel like Apple does relate to developers and Apple has not had to take its lumps in a good 20 or 30 years and has not had that level of forthrightness and humility with developers when things do go sideways, and this is where I think Ben Thompson has said multiple times on different podcasts and articles he's written, I think some people inside Apple view this and maybe those three top execs who've been there this whole time and a lot of people inside Apple, it felt humiliating, not humble. And that this was a period in their history that they were so beholden to third-party developers and they never wanted to be in that position again. They never wanted to have to take lumps again. They never wanted to be on that verge of bankruptcy. They never wanted to feel that pain and be humiliated like that again versus I go back and I read this, I'm like, wow, what a great example of just how much goodwill do you instill in developers in the entire ecosystem by speaking like that to developers? John Gruber: The first thing I'll say to that is that of those three executives you've mentioned, Eddie Kew, Jaws, and Schiller. Schiller's the exception where Schiller, I know you probably know this, actually hasn't been in Apple continuously since 1987 or whatever, and in the early nineties he was, I forget where else, but he ended up at Macromedia, which was the company behind PageMaker, or maybe not... No, I forget, but they had... They were the competitor to Adobe, and so Schiller has been on the other side of that divide making the essential tools for the Mac. That just helps add to that same perspective though of knowing how much leverage those companies had over Apple. And the two things that were scarring to Apple were the near bankruptcy. And so it's made the company institutionally incredibly frugal and more so while Jaws was still alive, it was only after Jaws died and Cook took over that they started doing things like shareholder buybacks and stuff while Jaws was alive. They were just hoarding their profits. They just were putting it into that Braeburn Capital subsidiary and just sitting on an ever-growing mountain of cash because in the same way that my grandparents who had been through the Great Depression would eat, scrape every single bit of food off their plate and thought it was offensive, no matter whether you thought it tasted good or whether you were still hungry, it was offensive not to eat every bit of food offered to you because they remembered not having enough food and the parts of the company that remembered being on the verge of bankruptcy, in some ways it helps focus the company, but in some ways in the long run sort of hurt them. And I think having somebody new like Tim Cook, again, he's been there a long time, but he wasn't there for the near bankruptcy part or came in just after, and so he wasn't as scarred by it. But I think that developer relations part definitely has, now that Apple has gotten big, has hurt them. That they're still so thinking of themselves as underdogs who want to assert not dominance over developers from their perspective, but having at least 51% of the power over developers that they've lost the fact that they've actually got 95% of the power or however you want to assign the power dynamic in the current state. They're so hell-bent on making sure they never fall below 51% of the power between the platform and the developers that they've just lost sight of how overwhelmingly they've already won and how much it would be in their interest to make concessions because of the surplus of power that they have to bolster developer goodwill. I don't think we're putting them on a hypothetical psychiatrist couch, but they do remember it. It's infused their thinking about the company. David Barnard: And we will put a pin in that to come back to as we talk about the more modern era of lawsuits and regulation and everything else like that, but stepping back and walking through the history, you do see a different apple after that. And so Apple does go on to build keynote and pages and numbers and the whole digital hub and they start building more and more of those key pieces of software. I think in part from that scarred time of we want to make sure there's great software for the average user and we're going to bundle it even though that's in conflict with our third party developers. We're going to give things away free or cheap, and you see a different Apple in that early 2000 era of like, we're going to control our destiny. Third party developers are important. We're going to be a platform. We're going to encourage them, but we're going to cover our own bases. We're going to make sure that we're not beholden to these companies in the long run by doing these things. And then kind of the next era as I was going through all of this, and this is where I kind of step into it, is what I was calling the Delicious Era. And there were these at the time, going all the way back to the eighties, kind of smaller passionate developers, but I feel like the heyday of this passionate small developer time was those early 2000s. You had Delicious Monster Building, Delicious Library and Panic and the Omni Group and Rogue Amoeba, and you could probably... Bare Bones, you could probably list another 20 off the top of your head, and there was this kind of renaissance. The iPod started driving more and more people from Windows to the Mac. There were these really passionate kind of fanboy developers building these really cool software for the platform. And as a platform, I feel like there was a bit of a heyday during that time where Apple was kind of... And Sherlocking famously came out of the Watson Sherlock thing in, I think, that was 2020, but there was this kind of heyday leading up to the iPhone of really great independent software creators while at the same time Microsoft and Adobe and others were starting to invest more back into the platform and the Mac becomes this really solid platform in that era. John Gruber: It's a tough thing to strike a balance on. It's almost impossible to just get perfectly right where it's clearly correct for there to be a suite of fundamental apps out of the box in a factory fresh new computer or phone or tablet. And that therefore that 1990 to 1995 Apple mindset of we're hardly going to ship any first party apps and everything will be third party apps because we don't want to step on their toes. And even if we have a subsidiary that makes Mac Write and Mac Draw and stuff like that, or File Maker, we're going to put it in a subsidiary and try to treat it as best we can as an actual third party developer, even though we own the company. That's not the right way to deal with a platform, but obviously Sherlocking every successful app is also not the right mindset. It's a hard balance to strike, and I think they've managed it pretty well, especially... And again, in the early 2000s when Sherlocking first became a term, it was so few years since the era when Apple studiously avoided ever stepping on the toes of third party developers, that it felt like all of this was newly offensive. And here in 2025, that's sort of ancient history. And so people don't think of it that way. So for example, just this month at WWDC, they announced clipboard history management in Sherlock on macOS Tahoe and a sort of more launch bar, Alfred Ray cast style superpowers in Spotlight where you can assign a two letter abbreviation to something to launch a shortcut or something like that. I think that they continue to strike the right balance where I, as a long time launch bar user, I'm glad they're adding those features to Spotlight, but there's 0% chance that I'm switching to Spotlight. I have an example though where here's a market where I feel like they tried to stay away from third parties and I think it bit them and now they're entering late, which is password management. And OnePassword is a great app from a great company that used to make a really great Mac app for passwords, and they're still a good company and the app is still fine. I've never been a user of it, but I see why people are. But the dynamic is the more popular and successful OnePassword came, the more that grew and they grew in interest to want to reach the enterprise market. And that changed the product in a way that made it not so great as a Apple product, an Apple platform product. OnePassword is still a great product, super good at a technical level, super useful in that enterprise context and in terms of some of the family sharing and stuff like that. But it's like if you really want the Mac style interface for password integration and the iPhone style integration and the syncing between the two, it started becoming not as great as it used to be because their interest in growing their market, which is great for the company, were in conflict with making it perfect for the Apple platforms. And so Apple came out with Apple passwords I think last year. I think it's only been a year, maybe it's two years. David Barnard: I don't know. It's been... Well, I mean, the password app, but they've been kind slow rolling into building the password app. John Gruber: It was effectively an app worth more than an app, a serious app worth of capabilities and features, but hidden away in a system settings panel for years, I think out of deference to we don't want to squash this market. But then I think as the market sort of moved into a less and less idiomatic Apple platform style of software, they were like, you know what? We should just make our own app because we could do this in a way that's very Apple-y. And I think now the new passwords app, it's a good introduction to how do you make a modern app for Apple platforms? Any area where they try to stay out of, eventually they find themselves having to enter. David Barnard: Yeah, so this is a huge can of worms that we could spend an hour talking about the balance of Apple, what they ship and what they don't, and what developers' toes they step on and what they don't. Maybe this is a whole nother podcast, but I want to step back and- David Barnard: Maybe this is a whole another podcast. I wanted to step back and see if there was anything else you wanted to share relating to the 2000s in that. I feel like that era did actually set Apple up really well for the iPhone as a platform. The Cocoa frameworks, the passionate developer base, the books that were written. When I started working on iOS, I intended to be the programmer and do it all myself. And so I bought the famous book of the era, Aaron Hillegass, Cocoa frameworks or whatever it was. And so by the time you got to the iPhone, there was this really solid, passionate community. Books being written, conferences being attended. WWDC had grown tremendously, and this era of the 2000s of the Mac becoming this really great platform was a springboard that then propelled the iPhone even faster as a platform than I think it would've otherwise been. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about that era before we jump into the iPhone era? John Gruber: The basic mindset in the late '90s in the industry was a sort of consensus that user interface design doesn't matter that much. Nobody would argue it doesn't matter at all, but that Apple's focus on making it the top priority of their platforms wasn't worth it because, okay, let's just concede that the Mac was a better user interface than Windows. Look at their market share. Obviously it didn't matter. It wasn't an unreasonable conclusion, but I think it was wrong-headed because I think that the problem that people arguing that way didn't see yet was that no computer. Again, it comes back to that argument that the iPhone is truly the first real personal computer, the one that every person would want and would care about. At the time, even in the late '90s, too many people making decisions about what computers to buy or what computers a company should buy weren't the people who care that much about user interface and therefore they were buying Windows PCs based on other criteria. Those early 2000s that built up this skill set in designers and developers and built up these teams of either companies or independents or just hobbyists, but at every level who could make software that was like, oh man, just look at it. Remember the Disco app. It was a DVD burning utility. When it burned the DVD, it actually had smoke come out of the window. Some people were like, well, that's just a complete waste of CPU and GPU resources, and other people were like, where do I buy this? I want to buy this because when I burn a CD or DVD, I want smoke to come out of the window because that's just cool and fun. This whole skill set was there for Apple and in 2008 when the app store opened up to build apps that people would just be like, but just look at it. Just look at this. Oh yeah, where do I get that app? I want to get it. It fueled this consumer fervor for the platform that no other platform could even hope to compete with at the time. There was no other platform. Early Android, they just couldn't do it. Microsoft's mobile, Blackberry, whatever. Nobody had the skill set. It was impossible to make anything that was like, just look at it. Just look at this app. Look how cool it looks. David Barnard: Yeah. I hadn't thought about it from that. The design perspective as well. I mean, that's what brought me to iPhone development. We'll move into the iPhone era now, is that I was that uber passionate Apple fanboy, Mac nerd. I had my, I don't even know what it was at the time, in 2007, some PowerBook that I had at the time. I loved the software, I loved the platform. I was first person, not first person in line. Well, I was first person in line to buy an iPhone. I was in line. Again, if you weren't around and weren't a fanboy at the time, it's laughable to think about this at the time, but I stood in line for, I think it was my iOS, Mac OS Tiger or one of those. There would be lines at the Apple Store and OS Update was a launch event. John Gruber: You had to pay $129 for it. David Barnard: Yes. You would line up to pay $120 to upgrade your operating system. It was that passion about the platform at that time that you had people like me and millions of us around the country who cared so deeply about the platform for all of these reasons is that it wasn't just good hardware, it wasn't just the OS, but it was this combination of OS and fun software and delightful, but it was productive. In 2003, I actually bought that 17 inch PowerBook because I was using Photoshop to manipulate this aerial photography for my dad's commercial real estate business. The Windows laptop I was on kept crashing. I was like, dad, I got to get a Mac if you want me to keep working on this stuff. Went and paid for it. The experience was night and day working on Photoshop on a 17-inch PowerBook than it was whatever crappy Windows machine I was using at the time. And so there was this fervor for the platform in that time that I think was the perfect setup. And also coming into the iPhone, there was enough of that groundswell of people like me. I was in China when Apple announced the iPhone. I went to the internet cafe at a Beijing hotel to watch a live blog of the Macworld keynote that you were at when they announced the original iPhone because there was just that level of fervor. And then six months later, my brother and I go get in line to buy the first iPhone. There was that passion, and then by the time they announced the SDK that next year, I jumped into it because I thought this is going to be something. I saw something different about the platform, and so much of that had been built up through Apple's experience across the decades building platforms of the turnaround of the Mac, of building the foundations with Cocoa and stuff like that. That ended up becoming the iPhone. And then by the time the iPhone App Store was released, there was this groundswell of developers who were just so excited about the platform. They could not build an app for this platform. It wasn't just original Mac developers. That was one of the fascinating things, you alluded to it earlier, is that a lot of the Mac developers didn't really do well on the iPhone because they were maybe a little too caught up in what they had built for the Mac. What we saw happen when the App Store launched with so many new companies being built, new ideas being explored, and just this fervor for building for the platform. John Gruber: There was a skill set that transferred immediately where somebody who is really fluent as a developer in Objective-C and the AppKit APIs on the Mac could immediately jump over, because it was just more limited. It was like AppKit but a lot more limited. But in terms of the syntax and the style of the APIs, they could just jump right in and thrive in a way that a developer who's familiar with Java at the time, which was super popular, or the Windows C++ APIs was like, what the hell's going on here with all the square brackets? But in terms of the concepts for what an app should be and do in the scope of it, it wasn't a mini Mac. It still isn't, but especially in 2008, 2009, it just was so much more limited and the context of where and how people would use it was so different that it just at a conceptual level be thinking in a very different way, not quite as profound. But along the lines of the difference between the purely command line interfaces of the early PC era where you just had text on a screen versus a graphical user interface. It was the same difference where it was like, hey, people are just going to sometimes open your app and want to use it like tap, tap done and get out. You could have Mac apps at the time where you'd launch the app and it would show a splash screen. It was a whole term of art like, Photoshop and Adobe apps famously would take 30, 40 seconds to launch because they were such big apps. Well, that made no sense on the iPhone. If you had that mindset like, I have this idea for an app, but it's going to take 20 seconds to launch, well, people would just be like, nah, screw this. I'm hitting the home button and deleting the app before it finished launching. David Barnard: To bring back the developer relations thread, WWDC 2008, which you were at, one of my big regrets in life is not going to WWDC 2008 because I founded my company April of that year to build iPhone apps. I had borrowed money from my family. I felt this tension of am I spending my family's hard-earned money that they've invested in me to go on a vacation to San Francisco to this developer conference? And so I did not go. What I heard in retrospect was that they were actually signing up developer accounts in person at WWDC that year. Could have been there day one had I gone, but this was the first time WWDC ever sold out. I've heard stories about past WWDC. They would be giving away tickets. They would be begging developers to come, and at WWDC 2008 was the first time it sold out. And then from then on, that groundswell of developer and the platform becoming so powerful, they never again had to ask developers to come. It was sold out every year after that, eventually having to go to a lottery. And then there's one more point I wanted to make was that at WWDC 2008, the slides from the presentations had the email addresses of Apple evangelists on the slide because they're like, hey, email us. We need more feedback. We want to know what's going on. Even as successful as the Mac platform had become, this was still pre iPhone Apple and pre the iPhone platform becoming what it became was such a different Apple. Funny story, because I had not gotten a developer account, I sent an email to five of the people- John Gruber: On the slides. David Barnard: On the slides. John Galenzi of all people responded to the email, gave me a phone call. I mean, to this day I remember he actually just retired from Apple. I had a lovely chat with him a couple of weeks ago at WWDC on the side because he's no longer at Apple anymore. John Gruber: No, he's no longer at Apple, but I saw him at WWDC. David Barnard: Yeah. Such an incredible human. But evangelists would put their email on the slides. It's just hard in 2025 how secretive, how close, how we choose you, you don't choose us. How hard it is to get the attention of Apple for the average developer. That was the era before the iPhone platform became so big. John Gruber: It was clearly a surprise to Apple. The whole idea that jobs had to be talked into opening up an API. I think that's overstated a little to some degree. I was going to say how much of that was just him blustering? Well, the difference is between should there be third-party apps for iPhone versus should the iPod support Windows. Now, Jobs wholeheartedly was against supporting Windows. He really was 100% on board with the iPod as a thing to help sell the Mac. Making it a Mac-only peripheral was in Apple's interest because it would bolster the Mac and every other executive from Schiller to whoever else was like, we're holding back the iPod as a platform by not supporting Windows. There's multiple books that he have written about it where he's like, all right, fine, go do it, but don't bother me. I don't want to know about it. And then he called it the iTunes for Windows, the Glass of ice water in hell. He was happy once it came out and he could see it and he could say that, he was happy, but he was really against it. I don't think he was against opening the iPhone, I just think he thought someday. I do think that maybe it happened a little faster than he thought. I don't think he anticipated announcing it in 2007. In fact, at 2007, WWDC was when they announced their "sweet solution" for third party developers, which was a very small JavaScript library where you could make some web apps that looked like native iPhone apps. They wouldn't have announced that in June on the cusp of the iPhone going on sale if they really thought, hey, we're going to have a native SDK early next year. It was September, October where they just made an announcement like, sure, all right, fine. We heard you. We're going to open an SDK. Give us a couple of months to get it together. We'll get back to you when it's ready. I think he thought it was like, we'll get to it in a couple of years, but I think it already was proving more popular and more resonant than he thought. I think Jobs and everybody at Apple knew this iPhone was a hit. They knew it was a thing. They weren't surprised that it was in sensation when they announced it, but it was even more resonant and more of a hit and bled out to more normal people. The iPhone first came out in 2007, right away in the summer of 2007, I'd be at Whole Foods and I'd have a shopping list in a Web App and Randos would just come up to me and be like, is that an iPhone? Is that an iPhone. All the time. I don't think Apple was anticipating that level of broad consumer appeal and it accelerated that. The WWDC thing is a perfect example. Before the iPhone, they had a whole extra track at WWDC. They called it the IT Track for IT professionals who managed Mac installations in corporate environments. It was because they had room, I don't know, I'm just ball parking, 3000 developers, but then 2000 IT professionals and a whole different track of sessions where instead of talking about APIs for making Mac Apps, it was sessions related to the very serious, a reasonable topic for a conference, but it was almost like two conferences in one. One for developers and one for IT professionals, just because they wanted to fill up Moscone and they had room. With the iPhone, it was like, oh, we got to get rid of that. There was this whole resentment because, it was I think a very good and successful and popular conference for IT professionals, but when the popularity of the iPhone happened, it was like, oh, they got to go. And then it became, even Mac developers felt like, hey, this used to be all about the Mac and now it's session after session after session is just about the iPhone. David Barnard: We've talked about a lot of things that are ultimately almost a fluke of history that things played out the way they did from Bill Gates saving Apple and all those things. I can't help but think. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit for it, but very soon after the iPhone was released, the developers jailbroke the iPhone and started writing native apps for it. Craig Hockenberry is one name I will call out. I wonder if that jailbreak scene and seeing what developers were building under insane constraints. Because when you jailbroke, Apple hadn't documented APIs. It wasn't a real SDK. Developers were having to reverse engineer methods they could call and how things were working. I can't help but think that some of jobs changing his mind so quickly was because of how innovative and how passionate that base was. I mean, I ended up buying it. When I started my company, I bought a second iPhone because I was too nervous to jailbreak my own iPhone. I bought a second iPhone, jailbroke it and installed all these apps for me as a way to study what apps could do. It's like you could study as a developer in 2008 before the App Store was launched and you had 500 apps to poke around to see what people were doing. I jailbroke a phone specifically to understand what could be done and what people were doing and what was going on with the platform. I can't help but think that Hockenberry and Steve Troughton-Smith and some of those other early jailbreak folks had an influence on the SDK actually coming out as quickly as it did. John Gruber: Yeah. I think Jobs appreciated that. Lucas Newman, who was at the Luscious library at the time and then went to Apple. I think it got him hired by Apple. I haven't heard from him in a while. I also know that, I think this is a public story, but Lucas Newman wrote the first game. It was called Lights Off, wholly backwards engineered, entirely. Hockenberry came out with a version of Twitterrific that was a native app before the year was out without any SDK from Apple, but building apps for the iPhone through Xcode. Just bananas to me that this happened. But I think Jobs appreciated that mindset because of all the crazy nonsense him and Woz had done back in the day before they founded was. Before they founded Apple making the little blue boxes that would let you make free long-distance calls on a payphone and stuff. The enthusiasm was just so much stronger where it was like they'd be crazy not to hold it back. David Barnard: Then March 6th, 2008 a date seared into my memory, they announced the iPhone SDK. This is again where I think people in 2025 don't appreciate what a different era that was in terms of what was possible as a developer to build a business. I wrote a business investment thesis that I sent to my dad and mom and uncle who ultimately invested in the company. I specifically wrote in there, what an incredible deal this is that I don't have to host my own store. Because back then, I mean, again, so easy to forget in this era of Stripe and AWS back ends and everything like that, that standing up your own web server to distribute apps, especially if it's a larger app, could get very expensive. Bandwidth was expensive. Working with third-party, payment platforms was a hassle. You needed a whole team to sort all that stuff out. And so when Apple announced the iPhone- John Gruber: Especially on a phone, right? David Barnard: Yeah. John Gruber: Credit card would be even harder. There was no way to scan it, no tap to pay. David Barnard: The only software that was on phones at the time was carrier build. You had to do a deal with a carrier and they took 50% of everything. The App Store was genuinely a revolution in software of a revolution of opportunity for developer. I mean, this is what I built my career on. This is why I have such a soft place in my heart and I'm so obsessed to this day with the App Store because it just fundamentally changed the opportunity you had as a developer to build a business. Of course that's not true anymore in 2025 with Stripe and hosted Back ends and Bandwidth being essentially free and all these third-party SaaS tools that you could spin up a Web App. I mean, geez, now even in Vibe coding where you don't even need a backend or hardly any experience to spin up a Web App that's just hosted on Replit. You can charge for it via built-in payment solutions. It's just crazy how much different the world is today than it was for that original App Store release. I think people today forget just how powerful that was. We were talking about this before we hit record trying to do the math. There are kids today, teenagers releasing apps on the App Store whose parents probably weren't even alive when Schiller and Cue and Joswiak joined Apple in the '80s. You could be a 16-year-old developer with a 40-year-old parent who wasn't even alive when all of this started with the Macintosh in 1984, much less 1976 when Apple was founded. I think there is a little bit of a loss of history and then maybe at Apple a little too much recognition of history of here we are in 2025 and the world has completely changed. The iPhone helped change the world 17 years ago, but now it's been 17 years since the world changed. People today looking from the outside without this history, I don't think appreciate the things that Apple appreciates. They don't have the context and the history. I think when you're trying to understand how Apple operates, why they're so insistent on the App Store fees and other things like that, you have to ignore all of that history, which to people's credit they don't even know. That's why we're doing this podcast. To understand Apple, you have to go back those 40 years and see all of what it took to get to the iPhone and then the iPhone becoming the platform it is and the billions and trillions of dollars that the platform has generated for third-party developers, that's hard not to just appreciate. John Gruber: To some extent at this point, it's becoming clear that Apple itself has fallen into the same trap. I'll exemplify it with a quote. I've been thinking about this a lot. I'm hopefully going to soon turn it into some article on Daring Fireball. There's a Steve Jobs quote. It's actually, Apple's made a big plaque of it, huge. It's, I don't know, 10 feet diagonal. It hangs not at Apple Park, but outside the Town Hall Theatre at the old Infinite Loop campus. The quote is, if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next. I think with the App Store in particular, boy that really resonate. It's not that they should forgo all profit and all commissions from the App Store, the whole, well, we started with 70/30. We should stick with 70/30. We've never raised it from 70/30 even when it's become more powerful or more monopoly, whatever you want to call it. David Barnard: As they've increased in control and the platform has increased in importance, they could have increased and squeezed and other things. John Gruber: Right. The people at Apple who are insisting on keeping as much of the commission's and the rules and everything as they have, but especially when it comes to payments and letting people link out to the web and stuff like that. They're thinking, hey, we built this thing that was so much more generous and developer friendly than everything that came before it on handhelds or, especially on phones. That they're still caught up in thinking of what it was in 2008 as opposed to that Jobs's quote, if you build something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. I feel like Apple is dwelling on the success and the innovation, true innovation, profound innovation that absolutely shook up and completely revolutionized the phone industry more than Apple even revolutionized the PC industry, but they're dwelling on it for too long. That they should move on and build something else new and start conceding on that issue. I think it is something that they've lost when they lost Steve Jobs. People think that they lost the ability to make new things, that it was always his ability to drive them to make a new thing. But I think he was good at, okay, fine. Again, I mentioned that whole iPod for Windows thing where he stuck with it for a year or two and then he was like, okay, fine, fine. At some point the people holding onto all of these rules and healing all these decisions about the anti-steering and stuff. Somebody at the top named Tim Cook should probably just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's just give in on a lot of this. We don't have to worry about it anymore. Just clear it off our concerns. I think it would be so good for Apple to just clear it off the table and just clear their time and their energy and their talent from executives down to engineers to just figure out what's next and make something new that would build into something where they have to worry about this again in 10 or 15 years. David Barnard: I want to dig into what I will affectionately call App Store 3.0 because I completely agree, but let's step back one more point in history. I have a bunch of notes. We could go through all of the early iPhone days. It's hard for people who don't even know that there weren't in-app purchases, that you had paid upgrades. That in order to do a paid upgrade, you had to release a whole new app and then transition users to it. There's so many points on the App Store history of just oddities and stubbornness and weird things that Apple did in those early days, even as the platform started taking off. But in 2016, Phil Schiller did a round of interviews. I think the one that most concisely covers it, maybe the one he gave the most access to was Verge. They titled the article App Store 2.0. And so in hindsight now I will give this way more credit than I think I did at the time of, it really was App Store 2.0. It really did fuel what we see as the current era of the platform. They open up subscriptions to all apps, which obviously working at RevenueCat and now all my apps are subscription. I know some users still bulk at it, but from a developer's perspective and being able to fund the creation of great software and continue working on it, that was revolution. That was App Store 2.0 to empower developers to better monetize apps. They sped up app review significantly. Again, if you weren't around a decade ago, you don't remember the days when it was seven days, 14 days to get an app through App Review. As much as you might complain about App Review today, at least you get that rejection in 24 hours to 48 hours instead of seven to 14 business days. They dropped the commission to 15% on year one renewal. If you started a subscription, that first commission would be 30, and then after that would be 15%. They announced App Store search ads as a new way to pay to get users. As much as we can complain about name squatting and having to pay to defend your brand, it's an incredible opportunity to be able to pay and get in front of people right there in the App Store. It's actually the paid acquisition channel that I recommend any App Store with. If you're struggling to get downloads, the first thing you should do is start figuring App Store search ads. That was App Store 2.0. They started removing a lot of these old apps that weren't working or just crappy apps. They started to purge the App Store and curate it a little bit more. That was App Store 2.0 in 2016. Looking back now almost a decade since. It really was a profound shift in the App Store that has led to so much of what we now get to experience as the App Store would not have happened had they not loosened the reins in those ways and made those changes. And so as much as we talk about, I complain on Twitter about Apple being obstinate and not changing and being stuck in the past and everything like that. The App Store 2.0 was them changing. Did they go on an apology tour? Did they, whatever? No. But they made very fundamental changes to the App Store that propelled it for this last decade. To your point, this is what I want to get back to today in 2025, is that it really does feel like we are in need of App Store 3.0, a deeper, more fundamental rethink of the opportunity. I think to your point, get out of the way. Let developers build. I think the Vision Pro is a good example too of the animosity that has started to build up. The frustrations and everything has gotten to a point where developers are way more wary of Apple. You posted some really great posts this spring, Apple, you're killing my vibe, and then another one by John Siracusa, just about developers seeing Apple more and more as a inconvenience to reaching their users versus a partner in building this incredible platform. The iPhone continues to sell like hotcakes. Apps are making money hand over fist. Developers are building apps, new apps every day. From the outside and looking at the numbers, maybe the platform is fine, but I think this sentiment where developer relations are in 2025 with the lawsuits, with the DMA, with all of the things that are going on, it feels like we're due another reset. Personally, I would love to that be a little bit more like the '97 jobs of like, hey, we did some things that we thought were right at the time and the forthrightness to say, here's why we think this. Here's why we did it. We're changing our mind. We're going to focus on building these great platforms moving forward. What does Apple need for the next decade and the decade after a vibrant developer community who's going to jump on the next day AI platform. Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are tromping at the bit and have billions of dollars to invest to not let this next platform play out the way the smartphone platform played out with Apple having so much control and so much power, maybe it's time for a bigger change. John Gruber: It's just proven so lucrative and forms the backbone of their services, "services that they report financially," which has been their growth vector for the last, I don't know, seven or eight years. Not because interest in the iPhone has decreased, but because clearly the iPhone is literally so popular that every single person in the world who lives somewhere where the iPhone is available and they can afford one and they want one has one. It's that popular that it has peaked because they've run out of people to sell it to. To their credit, it's part of the appeal that they build them to last. That's good for the environment. It's good as just a message that they're durable and the silicon is so good that five, six-year-old iPhones are still very credible devices. I'm running iOS 26 on an iPad from 2018, iPad Pro. It is a little slow. That's a seven-year-old device. The "services" has been their growth for the last seven or eight years. A lot of that comes not, they would like you to think that it's from Apple services, from people paying for iCloud and paying for Apple TV+ and whatever else they sell as a service. But a lot of it comes from their commission from the App Store, but they could decrease their cut and they could open up instead of fighting for these anti-steering things, especially going to the web stuff, which I've been against for years and years. I mean, pretty much ever since it became an issue that this is ridiculous. Especially like in the Kindle exemplifies it. That if the terms of the App Store are such that the Kindle App cannot sell app or books in the app without losing money on each book, which is the way the e-book publishing industry works, where there's a 70/30 split between the bookseller and the publisher and therefore if there's a 70/30 split between the publisher and the platform, they literally lose money on each sale that they'd owe. A $10 book, they would owe $3 to Apple, but they would owe $7 to the publisher and therefore at best would make nothing, so why do it? If you can't sell books through the app because of the terms of your store, you should absolutely let them have a button that says, go here to go buy books on the Kindle website. The idea that they fought that is, it's just absurd, and clearly anti-user. It just exemplifies how they've gotten caught up in thinking way too much that the point of the App Store is for Apple to get a commission on all digital content sales for the platform as opposed to what it should be and could be and should remain going forward, which is... John Gruber: ... could be and should remain going forward which is us maintaining control and having approval over the software and the APIs and what can happen in the background and how things are managed and how privacy is managed in the sandbox and everything is the best for the platform long-term and very much the best interest of the users. It should be that thinking. And then, the fact that we make a lot of money but maybe not as much money for all digital content on the platform because we do have and one of the ways you can do in-app purchases should be icing on the cake, which is clearly how they thought of it at the outset and they should just go back to thinking that. And I really do think that if and when they do, and I think it's a big if, but... And not at the point of regulation. Because if it's at the point of regulation, we see it. They're just going to make it convoluted and complex and the only way this knot is going to get untied is for Apple to willingly say, "You know what? We're going to lower the rate to 80-20 for everyone and 90-10 for small business," or something like that, "And we're going to just drop... If you want to send people outside the app to the web to make the purchases, just give them a button and they'll go to the web to do it." If they did that, I honestly think they would not see a significant decrease. And I think we're going to see that proved out in the coming months and quarters as Apple releases their quarterly finance statements after the recent ruling here in the US, their biggest market, that allows stuff like that. I don't think we're going to see a decrease in services revenue, now that they've been forced to open this up. So why not just open it up worldwide and make it easier for everyone and stop hanging the sword of Damocles over everybody that, "Hey, if we win an appeal in a year or two, we're going to revoke this access that you've now gotten at the point of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' legal declaration." It's better for the platform. Just make people happy. Make developers happy and users happy and Apple will profit from it. They really will. David Barnard: It does seem like dropping the fee would be a huge change in developer relations, in developer sentiment. I would hope they would go all the way down to 85-15 and I think there's Ben Thompson- John Gruber: And maybe something different for games maybe because- David Barnard: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. Yeah. Maybe games stay at 70-30 because that's what Sony and Nintendo and Steam and everybody else charges. Except for Epic with their App Store, but they obviously have reasons to artificially put that lower. But I can't help but think it would change the tone with the industry more broadly and be more in line with the reality of 2025. Now, you can argue, well, you're not just paying for payment fees. I think that's a disingenuous argument that a lot of people make. It's like, "Oh, Stripe is 3%. Why should we be paying Apple 30% for payments?" Well, you're not paying Apple 30% for payments and this is the argument Apple continues to make is that it's a platform fee. But there's a couple of things in there. One, it's almost a fluke of history that Jobs, in that original iPhone announcement said, "Hey, if you have a free app, we're going to distribute it for free and it doesn't cost you anything." And at the time, that was great and that created companies like Facebook and Uber and others where they might not have been able to make it work. Well, Facebook is a bad example because they were already reasonably profitable, but the iPhone certainly did springboard them even further. John Gruber: Yeah. But I would argue that the company is... It's not just that they adjusted and adapted to mobile. Meta, today, is unrecognizable from the Facebook of 2007. And in hindsight, they were clearly meant for mobile. To the point where they've got products that people use entirely on mobile, right? You can technically use Instagram on the web, but the vast majority of Instagram users have never once used it on the web. David Barnard: But would Instagram exist as it is today if they had to pay 50 cents per download or had to pay per user? John Gruber: Right, right. It is a quirk that Apple... Because Apple was coming at it from the mindset of the way the Mac worked. That there were free apps, but that any company that wanted to run the business from the app would be selling copies of the app. You'd buy the app before you installed it and that was Apple's mindset. And again, they were selling copies of their operating system at the time. If you bought a Mac that had Mac OS 10.2 installed and wanted to upgrade to 10.3, it cost $129 and it cost 100 some dollars or I don't even know what it cost to get Pages and Numbers and Keynote. All of that stuff was for sale for what would, today, strike people as bananas amounts of money and that was their thinking of how software would be sold. And I think the idea of a company and... Meta exemplifies it. That a company, like one of the five biggest companies in the world purely making software... Well, I mean I know they have got the glasses and stuff now too. But like Microsoft, primarily a software company, would be making all their money by giving apps away and only having ads in the app? It just didn't compute at the time and they never foresaw that... It's sort of a loophole. And if it costs them 50 cents a download per user per year, they could afford that very easily. David Barnard: They could. But then, would Instagram have been created? So many companies who have been built on top of it, could they have done it? But in 2025, when you look at the state of the world of Airbnb making billions of dollars, Uber making billions of dollars, Meta making billions of dollars, Google making billions of dollars on the iOS platform and not having to pay a penny other than $100 a year developer account. And here I am, indie developer supporting my family. I've paid Apple over a million dollars. I think closing in on $2 million in my 17-year history. Is that fair? And in the world of 2025, that just seems bananas like, "Why have I paid Apple $2 million for my dinky little indie apps and Meta has paid Apple $100 a year for 17 years?" It's bizarre. If you erase 40 years of history, if you erase all the context that we've built up to this point, and you just look at it as a logical person in 2025, that just seems bananas that I am paying so much to Apple and Meta is paying zero. John Gruber: I do think that was some of the thinking behind the core technology fee for the EU DMA compliance plan where it was sort of like, "What would we do if we did it all over again?" And I think that 50 cents per user per year fee for million plus download apps only was sort of thinking this is what they would do all over again. But the irony of that is that they're even walking away from that now, because the EU has said that the CTF is not compliant with the DMA. So they're switching to a core technology fee or commission which, again, is only on in-app purchases. So again, if you have a super popular app like Instagram that you can use without ever making a digital goods transaction through it, Apple makes nothing but the $100 a year developer fee. I do think they are thinking of it and they tried. The CTF was sort of their attempt but it is sort of a tricky position. But I think the answer to that is, "Hey, maybe you should just be happy that you own this platform and not worry about how much money you make from it," and, again, like that Steve Jobs quote. And just make something else wonderful and go on and really refocus on getting developers to say, "If I didn't have to answer to my boss or what I'm telling my boss and manager, I think we should do is put our efforts into making awesome software for these Apple platforms." To get that developer enthusiasm back I think is worth more to the company than whatever money they're making by breeding pure resentment with the current policy. And I don't want to let it slide, because you mentioned it but I want to emphasize it, that one of those differences between visionOS today and the original Mac in 1984, 1985 at this point based on where we are in visionOS's life, is that even though the Mac wasn't popular in 1985, there was this blossoming ecosystem of Native Mac software, even though the market share wasn't there. Because of the enthusiasm developers had who were like, "Oh my god. People..." It just clicked in their heads like, "This is the computer of the future. I want to make software for it." And we're not seeing that for Vision. We really aren't. There are cool apps and it's not a dead platform but it's nowhere near... visionOS today is nowhere near as vibrant a third party developer ecosystem as the Mac was in 1985 or 1986. And I think that should be the red flag for Apple and I think they might be a little surprised by that. I don't think they're surprised by the number of Vision Pro headsets they've sold, but I think they are a little disappointed and surprised by the lack of developer enthusiasm for the platform. And I think it's entirely because developers are so resentful of the way that Apple has treated them, specifically around finance and payments, that sort of thing. We can argue about the rules on background processing and stuff like that in sandboxing and stuff that apps would like to do. But it's really the resentment... First and foremost, numbers one, two, and three on the list of reasons why developer relations are strained with Apple has to do with money. Anybody who says otherwise is wrong. And Apple doesn't need money. Again, they are not operating on narrow profit margins. Their profit margins have gone up, not down. David Barnard: This is the tricky point though and this is me listening to too much Ben Thompson, but the tricky thing for Apple at this stage though is that the services revenue is so important to the growth narrative around the stock. That even though they don't need the money, they need the money to continue growing the stock at the pace it's growing. And that's the rock and a hard place that they've gotten themselves into is that the services narrative is so strong and that quarter-over-quarter growth in services revenue and services profit when the hardware has kind of started to flatline a little bit- John Gruber: I don't want to interrupt you. But it's like the Exxon Mobil's of the world ran into this problem when they were on top of this market cap lists where it's like, "Well, how many more cars and motorcycles and airplanes consuming fossil fuels could we have, right?" It's like everybody who could have one had one and they're not going to make cars that purposefully consume more fuel. There comes a point where a product or a service or a category really does max out in terms of human population and it's a good place to be. But if your mindset as a Wall Street investor is growth, growth, growth, how much more could they grow, right? David Barnard: Yeah. And maybe this is where we need to go back to this Steve quote from 1997 and maybe the message is as much to Wall Street as it is to developers and Apple saying to Wall Street, "We're going to need to take some lumps, potentially like you and I have said, I mean, if they dropped the fee to 15%, would they lose money? Maybe, but maybe Netflix would come back to the App Store. Maybe... In my job at RevenueCat, I talk to so many developers who are just, "Web, web, web, web, web. We're trying to push as much as we can to the web. We're going to experiment with pushing out of the app into the web now because it's more profitable. We want to save on that 30%." And so, if they drop the fee and it just didn't even make sense to charge on the web. Because at RevenueCat, we did some experiments and Netflix did some experiments with Apple, early in the Epic case, I think it came out that their number was somewhere around that like 12 to 13%. Where if the fee had been dropped that low, it would still be more profitable to operate in the App Store than outside the App Store. And then, there's a lot of complicating factors now too of owning the relationship and would Netflix want Apple to be an intermediary? Well, guess what? If Apple were a more friendly intermediary, maybe they wouldn't mind so much and they would just pick the one that was more profitable on the dollar for dollar basis. John Gruber: We know it's a solvable problem because there are more platforms for signing up customers that give the owner of the service, the newsletter, the streaming service, the music service, whatever it is, more direct relationship with their customers. We've seen them built, so Apple could obviously build one into the App Store. Instead of making all these entitlements over linkouts and stuff like that make it an entitlement where you kind of have to qualify and have these restrictions on, "Well, do you have a customer service department? What's your refund policy? We're going to enforce that you have a customer friendly refund policy where you don't have to call a 1-800 number and listen to somebody try to talk you out of unsubscribing. We're going to test it. That's part of app review, where it has to be as easy to unsubscribe as to subscribe. Otherwise, we will pull your entitlement." But then, if you qualify on those terms and you have those policies in place, you can have more of a direct relationship with your customers. Do whatever it takes to make developers happy to be building for the Apple platforms. Instead, they're clearly focusing on, how can we extract a decent enough portion of the revenue that's conducted on these platforms? David Barnard: Yeah. And so, taking liberties with the Steve Jobs quote from '97, "Apple's going to need to take some lumps in the coming months, but we're going to take it like an adult and I'm proud of that. And the result of that focus, focusing more on developers and building a fantastic platform over extracting as much revenue as we can from that platform, we and third party developers are going to build some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts." I shitpost on Twitter about Apple all the time and I know a lot of people inside Apple don't like me for some of those posts. But what I care about deeply is this App Store platform- John Gruber: Join the club. David Barnard: Yeah. You recently. It's that you and I care unreasonably about this platform. On an earlier podcast with Ben Thompson, I love this quote from him, he said, "It just breaks my teenage heart to see Apple continuing down this path that it's going on." And I think that you and I both have gotten to this level of frustration with developer relations and what Apple's doing and the way they're operating. Not because we hate Apple and want to see them fail. And not because we're just take joy in ridiculing them or complaining and criticizing them publicly. It's just that we care so deeply and we see the path that they're on and we don't think it's right. And if you take these 40 years of history, you can kind of justify things and you can see how internally they can justify it and see it this way and see it that way. John Gruber: Somehow, they've gotten attached to this income that they've extracted from commissions in the App Store in a way that they've never been attached to other things. I mean, you and I mentioned this during this podcast about the upgrade charge they used to charge for operating systems, $129 to go from Mac OS 10.3 to 10.4. They used to charge $5 to upgrade iOS. They clearly, at that time, were trying to get away from it, but they thought the accounting rules they were trying to follow required them to do it. They've given up on that knowing that it was better for them overall. In theory, you think, "Well, why would you ever... If people were doing it and lining up outside Apple stores to buy boxed versions of the software for $129 to upgrade their existing Mac, why would you ever do away with that if it was so popular that they were lining up?" But in the grand scheme of things, it clearly was the right decision to just make the operating system upgrades free to encourage all users to upgrade and to sort of steer them towards automatic updates, because they can do that because they're not charging. They couldn't do the automatic OS updates that most people, with their default settings on a Mac or iPad or iPhone, just at some point a couple months after the dot O, there's a version they think is stable enough. And overnight, while your phone's charging, you get the new... You're going to have iOS 26 in November or December this year. And they can only do that because they're not charging for it and it's better for them overall. Obviously, they've never made more money, their profits and revenue are at record highs. I think the same thing is true of the commissions in the App Store that, yes, at some level, if you're the CFO at Apple, you're like, "Well, why in the world would we ever decrease this? If we don't legally have to, why would we ever give up a penny of it? It's a lot of money." But it'll all work out in the end in terms of... And Joz himself has mentioned this in multiple of the interviews he did do last month at WWDC. He said the same thing to me and it was an off the record briefing I had with him and it was very cordial and nice. I am sure he won't mind me repeating it because he mentioned it on the record with Joanna Stern and multiple people where one of the things Steve Jobs often said, "If we make great products and tell people about them," that's the marketing part from his perspective, "tell them why they're great, it'll all work out in the end." That's just as true of the App Store as anything else, but it's this one area where they've got a compulsive institutional obsession with squeezing it that they do not need. David Barnard: And speaking of flukes of history, one of the... I think it was an epic case found an email from Schiller to Jobs saying, "What if we cap App Store revenue to Apple at $100 dollars?" Which at the time seemed- John Gruber: No, I think it was a billion. I think it was a billion- David Barnard: Was a billion? Okay. John Gruber: I think it was a billion. David Barnard: Or even a billion. It was like at the point in time when he wrote that, it probably sounded crazy like, "How will we ever make that much money on the App Store?" But then now, in hindsight it's like, "Oh my gosh. That's such a tiny amount to what they're making now." But had Jobs been convinced of that and had they announced publicly, "We're going to cap Apple's revenue on the App Store-" John Gruber: Or even if they never announced it publicly, David Barnard: Right. It became internal policy. John Gruber: Yeah. And that once it hit a billion, they dropped it to 75-25 and it stayed at a billion and it was growing some more and then they could drop it to 80-20. Then eventually, 85-15. Who knows? By now, they'd probably be at 90-10 or 93-7 or something like that. And at certain level then without ever having announced that, they could stop. If it had ever gotten even to 90-10, they could stop and say, "Well, now, we can just sort of let it grow because 10 is pretty fair." And yes, it's not the 2.7% Stripe takes or whatever, but 7% is arguably pretty good deal for everything the App Store offers. David Barnard: And imagine how different the last decade of developer relations would have been had Apple capped it at that. And then, the incentive wasn't for the financial side of things. The incentive was to build a fantastic platform for developers and empower them to serve our customers and keep innovating. John Gruber: And encourage developers and designers and even the companies and managers at those... Who aren't nerds and are into the platform, but just to encourage as much as they can, the mindset of, "Maybe we should build this for Apple platforms exclusively, because of the great APIs and capabilities and... Why even bother with these other platforms? We don't make any money on them. We're doing so great iOS only." They've really gotten away from that. It's to Apple's benefit in obvious ways to have as many developers as possible making Apple platform exclusive software. And at this point, there's such a resentment that to so many people, whether they're managers or executives or developers or just users who are like, "Well, you'd be crazy to build for Apple only because they're sort of against you in terms of trying to just take your money." David Barnard: As a long-term Apple watcher and being friends with so many developers. What do you think it would take? Is a reset even in the cards for Apple at this point? Would it take Phil Schiller on stage at the iPhone 18 whatever- John Gruber: They don't do anything on stage- David Barnard: ... keynote. Well, you're right. But what would it take to get a reset? Above the... I mean- John Gruber: I don't know. David Barnard: ... the money would probably go a long way like, "Okay. We're just going to drop the rate." But it does almost feel like there needs to be some level of that 1997 Jobs' humility of like, "Hey, we made some mistakes. You're going to see a new Apple moving forward." John Gruber: Yeah. But I think you don't have to do it... I don't think it's within Apple to say, "We made some mistakes and we're going to change," even though that's sort of how he addressed. He was willing to say that at WWDC 1997 because what they were scrapping were things that weren't under him, right? OpenDoc and Newton and everything else they scrapped. They weren't Jobs-led post next reunification projects. The Apple way of doing it would be to act like, "We've come up with this amazing new idea that only Apple could do and it's totally innovative and nobody else has ever suggested it before. And it's called taking less money from the App Store," right? And not apologizing and not saying... Presenting it as a new opportunity in the same way that they're pitching the liquid glass of iOS 26 as, "Hey, the capabilities of the hardware and the GPU and the screen display technology with HDR is such that we're able to present this interface that we couldn't have done before." Just present it as the market opportunities and the success of the iPhone are such that we're able to have a new financial set of rules around the App Store that we couldn't have done before, even though they could have. But just say that they couldn't. David Barnard: It's just frustrating on a human level. It's like at work, when I do something stupid or whatever, you apologize. There's just humanity in that level of humility that it is just frustrating to me on a human level. John Gruber: But that would count as an apology, right? It would. Because we'd know. David Barnard: For us as Apple followers, it would. But I think in 2025, the press would have a field day with that and just call BS in a way that I don't know that it would work. And this is kind of something I've been thinking more and more is that Apple needs to do some things on Apple, like to adjust to the realities of 2025 and to set themselves up for the next decade as a platform for developers as a consumer brand and everything else. For example, the small business program was so freaking Apple-like. Instead of just saying, "Hey, 15% for the first million, 30% for everything after," there was all these rules. You got to get into the program and then you get kicked out of the program and they created all these weird... To me, that's just the perfect example of how Apple over does things. And so, to usher in an App Store 3.0, I think we need to see them do things un-Apple-like. And I think that... Again, it's the fanboy in me just wanting to see a new version of Apple. Not that I hate Apple, not that I think they're idiots inside Apple, not that I think anything poor of them as a company, I want to see them succeed. I want to wear Apple glasses, not Meta glasses with a camera on them. And I think there's aspects of what they're building and the trust they've built with consumers and everything else that is setting them up for potentially being that next human computing platform. But having developers on your side and enthusiastic about it is going to be a huge, huge, huge boon. And given how competitive Meta and Google and OpenAI and others are and will be in the coming years, maybe it does require a bit deeper of a reset and doing some things that aren't traditionally how Apple operates. I think even this WWDC was a little bit of a reckoning in that Ben Thompson got it, you got it. Some people got it like, "Hey, this is Apple not overpromising so that they can overdeliver." But the press had a field day with like, "Oh, it's a boring..." They're so far behind on AI and all that kind of stuff. John Gruber: Nobody remembers that though. I mean, it's news for a week and here we are a month out and I think it's already forgotten. And I think Apple should have the fortitude, and the wisdom and you've mentioned at the outset, that their leadership's been there for so long. They remember this, they know how it goes, and they should just be confident in themselves in that way. The other thing about the fact that so many of the senior leaders have been there for so long, it means that most of them are nearing retirement. Schiller has stepped down and is in a different position as an Apple fellow. He still runs events, he still runs the App Store. Tim Cook is... I forget how many. What year? 64 or something like that? Or 63. Eddy Cue and Joz are in their 60s. And I'm not saying any of them are leaving soon. I mean, I'm sure none of them are going to pre-announce their retirements. But in terms of setting things up for the next generation of senior leadership at Apple, which is coming sooner rather than later, right? It's coming over the next decade, across the board, I think that they need to reset the institutional priorities of the company, because the new generation won't have that experience from the '90s that you brought up on this show to explain this. And instead if they took over right now, will just have the mindset of, "Oh, the way Apple works is they expect 30% of all the money on the platform." That's just the way it is and that they don't have any history behind it or why, but that they think that. As opposed to thinking that the most important thing Apple should do is encourage stoke and keep going in an ongoing relationship developer enthusiasm for building exclusive software for our platforms. And making it as great as possible and thinking, "Some of the best software experiences on our platforms are going to come from our third party developers, not from Apple." And that that's the way it should be. And we shouldn't be thinking that all of the best software comes from Apple and it's an afterthought what third parties make. David Barnard: And to your point, I hadn't thought of this until you've brought it up, that in setting things up for the future, I think there is onus on the current executives to not hold on to the past for the next decade when it's then too late. They're in the position, today, and having been at Apple 40 years... But one of the impressive things about Meta these past decade is that as a founder-led company, Zuckerberg put $100 billion into Reality Labs and is force of will and telling shareholders, "Hey, we're making these massive investments and they're going to pay off." And now, he's doing the same with AI, $100 million checks to lure AI talent. That's not something the stock market normally would reward, but he is out there pitching the world that, "Hey, this is an investment worth making and we're going to make it." And I think these Apple executives who've been there 40 years are the best people to say and convince the world, "Hey, we need to make some investments on the developer front and that's going to involve less services revenue," or whatever it has to be. But it's going to pay off in spades in the long run with the innovation that's going to happen with the renewed developer sentiment and everything else. That they're going to need for this next big platform in the coming 5 to 10 years. And it may be too late if they hold on. John Gruber: Well, I agree. David Barnard: Well, I think that's a fantastic place to wrap it up. And really, what I wanted to say on this podcast and hopefully people have gotten that depth of history of when you're frustrated with Apple about this policy or that, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than... And I mean even, again, as much as I complain on Twitter, I'll acknowledge that I lack a ton of context and I lack a lot of insight. And I'm sure I can understand why people inside Apple are frustrated at the way I frame things sometimes. But when you take all of that history and everything else into account, something needs to change. I'm not sure exactly what that is and me lobbying is me just throwing out ideas. Happy to be wrong about any of this, anything I'm suggesting. But I hope it's helpful to folks to better understand Apple in these ways. John Gruber: If there's one other point that I'll close with, it would be that I mentioned earlier that the problem Apple found itself in the early '90s when Jobs was exiled was this they were caught in this '80s mindset of every couple years, a new platform replaces the old platform and the old platform goes away. When, in fact, the Macintosh was here to stay and they just weren't treating it that way. I'd say Apple's come full circle now and views its platforms as institutions that are there to last decades, including, well, all of the platforms that they have. Including the Mac, which started in 1984. But the iPhone certainly, iPad, even the lesser ones like Watch and tvOS And I think visionOS are things that they intend to last for decades which, at this point, will last well past the careers of the senior leadership at the company. And I think they have that mindset. But I think they're currently doing some things and, again, related to money, just the goddamn money, that are contrary to fostering that. But it's this long-term mindset that the company has that these platforms are institutions and that Apple at a whole is an institution that is meant to be here for a very long time. David Barnard: And if they don't change... Or maybe they don't have to change, I don't even know. John Gruber: But I think if they don't change, then when new things come, they become legacy only. They're not going to disappear. The iPhone is not going anywhere. But the risk to the company is that they become legacy only maybe like Microsoft would be if they hadn't moved to the cloud, right? If Microsoft was still just about Windows and Office and stuff like that, where they would be? They would miss out on the next thing. That their next thing isn't going to hit unless they have developer buy-in. And that you can easily disguise that with the ongoing revenue and profits from those legacy things. In the same way that Microsoft would still be a very big healthy company, even if they hadn't shifted under Satya Nadella, but they wouldn't be number two or number one in the world right now. David Barnard: Yeah. All right. Well, it's been two and a half hours. I think we do need to wrap up but fascinating conversation. Thank you so much for your time, John, and this was- John Gruber: Thanks for having me. David Barnard: Glad to have you. John Gruber: This was fun. David Barnard: I really enjoyed it and I hope it's useful to folks. John Gruber: I won't feel so bad the next time you're on my show for two hours. David Barnard: Thanks so much for listening.

Title: One of Wall Street's biggest bulls sees tech powering an 11% gain in stocks through the rest of 2025

The US stock market looks like it's going to keep powering through to new records, says one of the biggest bulls on Wall Street. Christopher Harvey, the chief US equity strategist at Wells Fargo, predicts that the S&P 500 will reach 7,007 by the end of the year. His forecast — now one of the most optimistic on Wall Street — implies the benchmark index climbing another 11% from its current levels, or a 19% gain for the year. Speaking to Bloomberg about his thesis on Monday, Harvey pointed to a handful of reasons that would keep the market climbing higher: AI boom. Mega-cap tech stocks will likely keep climbing higher, Harvey said. He brushed off concerns that the hype over artificial intelligence resembled the dot-com bubble in the 1990s, noting that many companies today have stronger fundamentals. Large-cap tech and AI stocks have been on a tear since their low in early April, shortly after President Donald Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 41% from its April 8 low. "What we're seeing is the winners continue to win. The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trade in AI that will continue," Harvey said. Strong mergers and acquisition activity. Dealmaking has remained relatively strong on Wall Street, another factor that should support the market, Harvey said. Strategic M&A activity was up 11% year-over-year from January through May, according to an analysis from the consultancy Bain & Company. "We think that M&A will continue to be very, very healthy up and down the capitalization," Harvey added. The US consumer remains strong. Americans keep spending, despite concerns that tariff-related price increases could shut off an important engine of the economy. Consumers ramped up their spending more than expected last month, with retail sales rising 0.6%, according to the US Census Bureau. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates. The central bank looks on track to eventually lower interest rates despite hesitation stemming from President Donald Trump's tariffs in recent months. Investors are pricing in two or three rate cuts from the Fed by the end of 2025, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Those bullish factors override any concerns investors have over the market, Harvey said, pointing to concerns about the impact of tariffs and Trump's escalating feud with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Investors are worried that tariffs could raise inflation while hampering economic growth, and that Trump could interfere with the Fed's independence, which could stoke inflation down the line. "We had seen Trump 1.0. We know his style," Harvey said, referring to the belief that the president goes hard on his policies before softening his tone. Harvey was one of the few strategists on Wall Street who stuck to his original S&P 500 target for the year, even during the historic sell-off in April as Trump unveiled his slate of tariffs. Forecasters like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan lowered their stock forecasts and lifted their recession odds, before reversing once Trump paused most tariffs. Jump to

Title: Why You Are Reading Reddit a Lot More These Days

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. It doesn’t really matter who you are, how you spend your time online, or what you imagine your relationship with the internet to be. However you scroll, wherever you browse, and whatever you want to see on your screens, it has probably happened to you, and if you haven’t noticed yet, you may now: Your world has become more Reddit. The 20-year-old platform, which began as a niche link aggregator and gradually grew into the web’s default community of communities, has gone from optional to inescapable, its little red alien logo manifesting no matter which way you look. For my zoomer cousin, a professional TikToker who was still learning to read when Reddit was founded, it’s obviously “the only place where you know there are real people.” For 82-year-old user LogyBayer, who grew up programming FORTRAN on punch-card computers in the 1960s, Reddit, where he has posted thousands of times, is the closest thing he can find to “the wondrous world of Usenet,” the online discussion system that predates the web. Many of the less online people I know, who had maybe heard of Reddit, are now tapping through threads about life advice and HVAC repair; at the same time, some of the most online people I know, who for years saw Reddit as a sort of internet playpen, a meme aggregator downstream of more vital communities, are now logging in daily. It’s happened to me, too, a screen-addled tech reporter who has been covering the platform’s growth — and various problems — for well over a decade with at least notional remove: When it’s time again to pick up that phone and incinerate a few more seconds of my one life on earth, more often than not, I shovel them into Reddit. This isn’t just a feeling. Reddit, after two decades of gradual and uneven growth, is exploding. According to Similarweb, it’s one of the largest properties online; if you take away social apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, and utilities like Google and ChatGPT, its closest competition among websites is Wikipedia. In 2023, according to the company, Reddit had around 60 million unique visitors a day; its latest earnings report puts the number at 108 million a day, 400 million a week, and, according to conservative estimates, well over a billion different people using it every month. About those earnings reports: In 2024, Reddit went public. Its stock price popped, then climbed alongside its traffic. Revenue is way up, and after years of losses, the company eked out a slim profit in the last quarter. Why now? Reddit’s co-founder and current CEO, Steven Huffman, suggests the answer is obvious. “When we started Reddit, it was a web page of 25 links from around the internet,” he says. “Now, 20 years later, you’re stumbling into some thread where people are telling stories they’ve never told before and it drifts into life advice for someone who lives 2,000 miles away.” He didn’t see that coming, he says, but “in hindsight, it actually makes a lot of sense.” For years, Reddit, which is made up of thousands of sub-Reddits moderated by volunteers, offered a centralized and streamlined alternative to the web’s thousands of small and scattered forums, message boards, and independent communities. At the same time, in contrast with the much larger social-media platforms that rose around it, it looked niche. “The word social media didn’t exist” when the site was launched, Huffman says. Since then, in his telling, the company has steered away from influencer culture and growth-at-all-costs social-media scaling — “we don’t want people to be famous because of Reddit,” he says — and toward realizing “the vision of the old web.” Another way to tell the story is that the platform largely just stayed put. In any case, as the mega-platforms merge into TikTok-clone sameness, Reddit’s steady focus on giving online randos a place to pseudonymously post with one another is paying off. In Huffman’s view, Reddit’s growth is simply its reward for stubbornly — maybe accidentally — “fulfilling the promise of the internet.” It’s a good story, and there’s something to it. But just out of frame, there are … a few other relevant things happening online, each as obvious to the typical browser as Reddit’s sudden come-up. The World Wide Web from which Reddit grew, and for which Huffman expresses so much reverence, has been going through something akin to ecological collapse after being poisoned, then abandoned, by advertisers that have little use for independent websites anymore. At the same time, the rise of generative AI suggests a lot of people are just as happy — if not happier — getting life advice, news, and conversation from a robot that has read a bunch of sub-Reddits as they are chatting with internet strangers themselves. Reddit’s place in the collapsing web is both valuable and risk-laden. Google’s response to the gradual breakdown of the digital commons has been to send more and more people to Reddit, where relevant results are at least probably written by human beings, lavishing the site with traffic but binding the companies’ fates together. Reddit’s relationship with AI is similarly tense: As a training corpus, Reddit is immensely valuable; after years of unauthorized scraping, the company has official licensing deals with Google, which sometimes turns its content into AI-generated search “Answers,” and with OpenAI, which uses Reddit’s vast archives to give its chatbot depth and outside sourcing and to help it sound like a normal person — or at least a normal redditor. Meanwhile, Reddit moderators are battling a flood of inauthentic content generated by chatbots that were trained, of course, on Reddit. They’re getting tired while users, less certain that other commenters are real — and less sure of their ability to tell and noticing the rising tides of slop elsewhere — are drifting into mutual suspicion. Huffman suggests that, just as Reddit was rewarded for offering an alternative to more baldly growth-and-ad-driven social media, it could serve a similar role in the post-ChatGPT world as a refuge for actual human interaction in a sea of generated text. “Social media made Reddit make more sense, and I think now that the web is kind of dying, sadly, that evolution helps Reddit make more sense,” he says. “Reddit in that era is, Reddit is not social media. And now, we’re entering this new era where Reddit is not AI.” It’s a powerful pitch, to the extent it remains true. But it doesn’t quite capture just how strange and risky Reddit’s position is in 2025. Being one of the last islands of humanity on a dying web may make you more appealing to, well, humans. But it also makes you even more valuable to the companies doing the killing. Reddit is an alternative to a web that’s harvested, polluted, and depleted by tech firms in a race to dominate AI. It’s also an increasingly valuable data source for tech firms in a race to dominate AI. How long can it be both? Reddit has occupied a series of strange, sometimes contradictory positions in the public imagination over its 20 years of existence: a nerdier alternative to Digg, whose users it inherited after a redesign gone wrong; a platform overwhelmed by young men who were, at different times, in the tank for Ron Paul, Barack Obama, and Bernie Sanders; the world’s leading aggregator of revenge porn; a crusading platform against revenge porn; and a staging ground for Donald Trump’s online campaign, among many others. At different times, and to different people, it was an obscure “dark corner” of the web, an unbearably “cringe” platform downstream from real internet culture (akin to 4chan or, actually, its polar opposite); a platform of free-speech crusaders; a hive of groupthink and censorship; and ground zero for an ongoing retail stock-trading boom that has since outgrown it. Through it all, the platform has remained in some ways remarkably consistent. (As the critic Alex Pareene wrote a few years ago, Reddit went “from merely embarrassing but occasionally amusing, to actively harmful, to — mainly by accident — essential.”) In 2005, Reddit looked a lot like it does now, a list of links on which users voted up or down. By 2008, it worked a lot like it does now, with comments, sub-Reddits created and run by the community, and the rise of self-posts — threads without links, created to talk, argue, or share things directly. To a user in 2008, Reddit was legible as a forum of forums, a new and centralized take on the sorts of scattered web communities where people used to spend a lot of time on a much smaller internet. To a user in 2025, this can make it feel like a throwback. We’re further from Reddit’s founding than Reddit’s founding was from the creation of the web browser. It still basically operates within structures and norms established on dial-up bulletin-board services and email lists: communities sorted by interest, volunteer policing, and threads upon threads of text. Reddit’s formal and cultural stubbornness — and its roots as a mid-aughts gathering place for (mostly) young men interested in technology and the stunted online culture of the time — has helped and haunted it for its entire existence. Huffman, who co-founded the site with his college roommate, Alexis Ohanian, and the late activist Aaron Swartz, left the company after it was acquired by Condé Nast in 2009. (In 2011, Condé Nast spun off Reddit into an investable subsidiary of Advance Publications. Its $10 million investment would eventually be worth more than $2 billion.) Huffman returned in 2015 after a series of user and moderator revolts driven, in part if not completely, by the attempts of CEO Ellen Pao to figure out what to do about growing communities with names like Jailbait, Pics of Dead Kids, Fat People Hate, and Beating Women. He did so with a mandate to square the platform’s need for growth with the desires of a user base that was incredibly allergic to being told by the company what it could and couldn’t do. “It’s kind of an egotistical thought,” Huffman told New York Magazine at the time, “but I felt like I’m literally the only person in the world who can fix this and I had a moral obligation to do so.” There was resistance within the company, too. “Huffman stepped into what was basically a company on fire and was met by employees who were either disgruntled, burned out, or just done with the drama,” says Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, author of We Are the Nerds, a book about Reddit’s history. “Half the staff left within days.” This was, in hindsight, the beginning of a long process of growth-and-revenue-oriented taming and professionalization with occasional top-down mandates and a few more user revolts — the most recent in 2023 after the company limited access to developers, threatening third-party apps and tools used by moderators, resulting in mass sub-Reddit blackouts and a moderator exodus. The company by turns tolerated, managed, or crushed user backlash on the way to the big prize: Reddit’s IPO. In May 2024, shares in Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, its $34 listing price valuing the company at $6.5 billion. In July 2025, shares trade above $150. “It’s almost as if he made a list of all the things that had haunted Reddit as a site for years and built systems to dismantle them,” Lagorio-Chafkin says of Huffman. In person and as the trollish and frequently maligned “spez” on Reddit, he served for years as a representative of and foil for some of the site’s most vocal (or at least stereotypical) users: a millennial white-guy programmer who enjoys arguing a little too much for his own good. Post-IPO, Huffman is now much wealthier — his shares in the company are worth north $600 million — and, as is customary in his San Francisco cohort, conspicuously muscular. After years of corporate expansion, Reddit is starting to resemble the larger tech companies he likes to use as foils. In 2015, when he returned, Reddit had fewer than 75 employees. Now, it has more than 2,300 staffers and a market cap of $28 billion. It’s also — finally — turning a profit. It would be an overstatement to say Reddit’s transition into a publicly traded online platform was smooth. “We’ve lost a lot of moderator skill since the IPO,” says one longtime volunteer who communicates regularly with Reddit’s leadership. These tens of thousands of moderators aren’t just helpful — they’re operationally crucial, keeping the site organized and (relatively) hospitable. The 2023 revolt drove a lot of people out, and the loss of third-party tools for dealing with the workload was a pain for the ones who remained. (At the time, Huffman compared protesting mods to entitled “landed gentry”; among volunteers, the episode is still referred to as “fuck spez.”) Before Reddit developed its own replacement tools, another moderator tells me, “We had a solid year of unchecked spam hitting all sub-Reddits.” At the same time, mods were dealing with a new problem: AI. “With text-only subs, we see increased attempts by people generating fake stories,” the moderator says, and discerning the difference between AI posts and typical Reddit comments was suddenly much harder. Image-based sub-Reddits, suddenly glutted with generated material, scrambled to come up with rules — “constantly disputed,” the mod says — and struggled to enforce them. Suddenly, spammers and trolls had superpowers. Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Zurich dispatched “semi-automated, AI-powered accounts,” which identified themselves variously as rape victims, trauma counselors, and Black men opposed to Black Lives Matter, to a sub-Reddit called /r/changemyview, where the researchers claimed they achieved “persuasive rates between three and six times higher than the human baseline,” leaving users annoyed and moderators enraged. (A majority of the accounts used in the study, however, were flagged at the time by Reddit’s automated systems.) Meanwhile, the longtime mod says, recruiting new help has gotten harder. “People hate you. The people who want to do it are power hungry, and the really good ones burn out.” They also have somewhat less control than they used to (they can no longer lock down their sub-Reddits in protest, for example). “I think the company is under a lot of pressure to remove power for moderators,” he says. “I need more people, but Reddit would like people to have less power.” Laura Nestler, Reddit’s VP of community, says managing mods is crucial to the platform’s survival. “They’re stewarding their communities, they’re building the norms, building the rules and enforcing their independent individual rules,” she says. “Our goal is just to empower moderators and communities to do what they’re gonna do.” Mod drama isn’t a sideshow. Like Wikipedia, Reddit works only if people feel like posting there and if moderators feel like volunteering hours a week — or a day — to keep things clean, civil, or at least functional. Unlike Wikipedia, Reddit is a for-profit company, which makes its volunteer model fragile in different ways. (For an idea of what happens when your army of volunteer contributors loses interest in boosting your company’s bottom line, look no further than the rotting corpse of Quora.) Before the IPO, Reddit offered some longtime moderators early access to its stock. Now that they’re volunteering for a public company, though, some are floating another idea: Maybe they’ll need to get paid. Still, the transition happened, and the admin-mod-user relationship that keeps Reddit running remains more or less intact. “I think what’s underappreciated is that he continued what Ellen started,” Lagorio-Chafkin says — cracking down on hate speech and harassment and building “sturdier internal teams.” As a result, she suggests, Reddit is far larger, more functional, and more diverse than ever, with sub-Reddits for just about any pastime or interest you might come up with, often filled with more people than you might expect. According to the company, Reddit is now used by slightly more women than men, and, unlike a lot of other large platforms, its share of young users is growing. Fandoms have sub-Reddits, and so do brands. The platform functions broadly enough to host, for example, a massive sub-Reddit for Uber-rider stories and complaints (“Driver picked me up with her infant and boyfriend in the car”) as well as a sub-Reddit with more than 420,000 subscribers for Uber drivers (“She peed herself in my car. I can’t blame her”). Any sufficiently popular sub-Reddit eventually spawns a “circlejerk” counterpart in which users mock the host sub-Reddit. Reddit is also far more international despite English still being the dominant language. It’s not uncommon, particularly in sub-Reddits devoted to personal stories and advice, to realize that the difficult in-laws in question live in Bhopal or that the requested product recommendations need to be available for purchase in Jakarta. More surprising, perhaps, is the persistence of one of Reddit’s less publicized functions, even through its IPO and efforts to court mainstream advertisers: There are still massive amounts of porn on it with thousands of sub-Reddits filled with just about any sort of adult content you can think of and quite a bit more. The largest isn’t even an aggregator: On /r/gonewild, which has more than 5 million subscribers, redditors post nude photos of themselves. Plenty of the dynamics resemble, as Huffman suggests, an extension of the “old web” ethos of community and connection, albeit enabled by new internet techniques. Once built purely around a unified front page and followed sub-Reddits, users now get algorithmic recommendations. As with any such system, this has the effect of making the platform feel larger and, at times, more isolating. There are also more ads than there used to be (Reddit’s revenue last year was just $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion of which came from advertising). Still, from the inside, Reddit remains recognizably Reddit. Strains of its dominant 2010s culture have become less important if not less obvious, aging and mutating with some of its most devoted longtime users. There are plenty of kids there talking about kid things, and a surprising number of elderly people, too, but there are also, unmistakably, a ton of American college-educated millennials, many of whom now have jobs and children and whose once-nerdy interests and sensibilities have become, with some help from Reddit itself, genuinely mainstream — so much so that the site’s name on the platform and elsewhere has become a pejorative shorthand for normie millennial tastes. There are large and active conservative and pro-Trump sub-Reddits, but the largest and most extreme MAGA communities have been officially banned by the company or marginalized in the community, meaning America’s dominant political movement is rendered on the platform’s most popular sub-Reddits as an absurd and enraging external force and as fundamentally incompatible even with Reddit’s commercialized approximation of a shared, deliberative commons. Posts fishing for earnest responses from Trump supporters are more likely to be answered by young liberal redditors venting about their parents. Years of failed attempts to create a conservative alternative to Reddit have instead culminated with a migration back to X, with which Reddit is now engaged in a sort of simmering mega-scale forum war. (Early this year, Elon Musk lashed out at Reddit, where some sub-Reddits had banned links to X, and privately pressured Huffman to step in.) One way to understand Reddit is as a largely functional, self-sustaining community that its leadership managed to avoid fucking up — an old and sturdy system that remains, against all odds, basically intact. But this alone doesn’t explain its growth or the situation it finds itself in now. For Reddit to grow as it has — suddenly and massively despite largely staying the course — it required some help. First, it needed the web to collapse around it and social networks to chase TikTok into video-recommendation oblivion, leaving readers desperate for anything resembling actual human discussion. Then it needed Google. In 2019, on the tech-industry Reddit clone Hacker News, users discussed a blog post about missing the “old internet,” pining for the days before it was ruined by the “commercial smog thrown up by Google.” Multiple commenters shared the same advice: “I’ve taken to appending ‘reddit’ to many of my search queries, because flawed though it is, Reddit is one of the few places you can read an actual human thought,” one wrote. Sure, Reddit was still a “cesspool,” full of bullshitters and tiresome “in-jokes” of its own, commenters said, but the advice was well received — and prescient. Reddit users shared the tip, the company itself publicized it, and the “reddit” hack went mainstream. By 2022, Google had taken notice and adjusted its search algorithms in a way that surfaced Reddit more often, particularly in response to open-ended questions, and said it would guide users toward “helpful content” and more “first-person perspectives.” By 2023, search analysts were tracking dramatic increases in Reddit’s visibility on Google; one report estimated that Reddit had gone from “57 million visits from Google U.S. … in July 2023 to 427 million in April 2024.” Reddit’s own numbers told a similar story: The mature, newly public company, which had been fighting for incremental growth its whole life, was suddenly tracking like a viral start-up, its total traffic growing yearly by half with no signs of slowing down. At first in its earnings reports, the company was slightly coy about what was going on, emphasizing how important Reddit had become to Google, not the other way around. (“Reddit was the sixth-most-Googled word in the U.S.,” Huffman noted at the time.) Reddit’s disclosures told the story more clearly: It reported that logged-in users — i.e., people who already had Reddit accounts — were up 27 percent globally, while its logged-out visitor numbers were up 70 percent. There are plenty of reasons the internet feels more Reddit these days, but none are as important, nor as straightforward, as this: Google, in an effort to cope with its own rotting search index, has been sending us there by the hundred million. In an interview, Huffman emphasized that this isn’t entirely new and that Google has been sending people to Reddit in unpredictable quantities for years: “We get a ton of traffic from Google today. We know that’s not forever. We’ve seen it in our history. It comes and goes.” While a recent collapse in Google traffic has been a disaster for e-commerce operations and online publishers, Huffman says, such changes wouldn’t be a disaster because — again — Reddit remains Reddit. “We have a lot of content that Google likes, and the reason Google likes it is because we didn’t generate it for them,” he says. But without the massive assist from Google, the past few years of Reddit’s story look quite different. Adam Bumas, an analyst with research firm Garbage Media, has been tracking upvotes on popular sub-Reddits since Reddit shut off access for most outside tracking tools. Despite the influx of new visitors, this sort of active participation has remained flat — a story, Bumas says, of “maintaining rather than growing.” Without Google’s firehose of visitors, other risks come to the fore: competition from platforms like Discord, the real-time chat platform popular with younger users, where many sub-Reddits already have a presence; the growing preference among advertisers for video rather than text; and, of course, the rise of chatbots. There are also reasons to suspect that, today, Reddit’s past relationship with Google may not be a reliable guide. Google’s uses for Reddit aren’t just about search, nor have they been merely convenient: In February 2024, the company announced it was “expanding its partnership” with Google, allowing for “new ways for Reddit content to be displayed across Google products” but also for Google — which was by then spending tens of billions of dollars a quarter pivoting to AI — to train its models on Reddit’s vast corpus of “authentic human conversations and experiences.” For Google, spooked by the rise of ChatGPT, this was urgent. By May, it had rolled out AI-generated “answers” above its search results, many of which were clearly drawn from the platform, but which, by design, were far less likely to send users there. When the feature made headlines for a viral AI-generated search result that suggested adding glue to a pizza recipe, the backstory implicated Reddit: Google’s AI had misread an 11-year-old joke from a Reddit user called “fucksmith.” It was funny, of course, but also told a particular story about the future of the platform. Reddit — the last website, the imperfect and commercially conflicted steward of the “promise of the internet” — was being harvested to train tools that purport to be able to do a lot of what Reddit users do for one another: answer questions, provide recommendations, open rabbit holes, indulge argument, and waste time. It was training its own replacement. From inside the platform, Reddit’s relationship with AI is unremarkable. There are large active communities of AI enthusiasts sharing productivity hacks as well as sub-Reddits full of apocalyptic doomers, sci-fi optimists, and total skeptics. Users routinely call out comments that appear to be AI-generated and lament the rise of AI slop outside of Reddit’s (relatively) safe perimeter. Moderators see a rise in AI-generated engagement bait and comments — more, they say, than Huffman admits — but they don’t see it as a crisis, at least not yet. As a business, Reddit has been pushing further into AI-powered moderation and has polled users about AI content-creation tools. With users, it has moved cautiously, launching an internal AI search tool that lets users browse threads through a chat interface. To advertisers, it has been a little more aggressive, pitching them an “AI-powered social listening tool designed to unlock strategic value from Reddit’s 20 years of conversations.” But Reddit’s careful approach to AI features is misleading: Except for Wikipedia, maybe, no independent website has provided as much raw training data for as many AI firms, authorized or not, as Reddit. As a corpus for machines trying to sound or reason like people, it’s immensely valuable: pre-organized, pre-moderated, cleaned and sorted by the input of millions of volunteers and users, and written, unlike so much else on the web, without SEO, traffic, or advertisers in mind. Likewise, its relationship with OpenAI runs deeper than the deal announced in early 2024 through which Reddit licensed data to OpenAI for training and to bring Reddit content directly into ChatGPT. In 2015, the day after OpenAI was founded, Sam Altman, in a joint interview with Musk, mused that “all of the Reddit data would be a very useful training set” for building future AI; earlier that year, Altman, who had by then known Huffman for a decade, helped orchestrate his return as CEO but not before serving as CEO himself for a week. Altman was an early investor in Reddit and sat on its board until 2022. Huffman, who still regularly speaks with Altman, is hardly an AI skeptic. But when it comes to AI’s impact on Reddit — at least in his capacity as a CEO — he’s fairly sanguine about the future. “There are times the AI is superpowerful, and there are times when you just don’t want it,” he says. Sure, some of what people get from Reddit, they may soon be able to get from chatbots trained on it. “It can give you lots of decent answers to a wide variety of questions,” Huffman says. And there’s no doubt AI will rip through the economy of the web, which is already filled with cheap and largely replaceable content. “AI is going to kill the bullshit because AI is better at bullshit,” he adds. Reddit has plenty of bullshit too. But a lot of questions brought to Reddit, Huffman says, are questions without clear answers — the sorts of questions where, even if you’re not asking them yourself, you’re there to read what other people think, work things through, argue, and joke around. “I think what will stay constant is that human beings want to talk to each other,” he says. “People like talking. They like asking questions, they like hearing answers, they like giving answers, they like having a few laughs, they like being helpful.” The big social platforms don’t offer that anymore, and chatbots can’t either. “The core of Reddit actually becomes more valuable over time when the rest of the internet turns into AI.” In the background, though, Reddit has started acting a bit more paranoid. As a measure against bot-generated content, Reddit is reportedly considering partnering with World ID, an iris-scanning crypto and identity start-up (started, of course, by Sam Altman). The company recently sued OpenAI competitor Anthropic for allegedly scraping its “vast corpus of public content” for its “enormous utility” and has threatened to sue the university researchers who ran the undercover AI experiment. Meanwhile, brands, advertisers, and spammers are reportedly swarming the platform hoping to cash in on Reddit’s visibility in both Google Search and in AIs trained on and monitoring its posts. As insular and resilient as Reddit has been, it’s a resource that needs to be maintained and one that could be depleted. The through-line in Reddit’s history is that it has always been forced to answer to its users and thousands of volunteer moderators, whether or not what they were demanding made sense for Reddit as a community or a company. In some ways, this dynamic surely held them back. But just as clearly, in hindsight, it probably kept the entire project alive. Huffman likes to emphasize that Reddit has been through a lot. When it launched, nobody was using the internet on smartphones, and the tiny company saw MySpace, Friendster, and Xanga as unassailable incumbents. It watched as they collapsed and were replaced with true giants, which shape-shifted as they grew, all the while remaining fundamentally and stubbornly the same. “Look, we’ve been around 20 years,” he says. “So we have, I think, some perspective and comfort with the way the internet evolves.” When I ask about risks, he spins to synergies. The trashing of the web, the lavish attention from Google and AI firms, the scrutiny of investors who care about returns above all — these are fundamentally aligned with Reddit’s interests and will carry it to the next billion users. Huffman is more optimistic than ever about Reddit’s internal tensions, too, having gotten, in his view, the platform’s worst instincts under control. He recalls with clear satisfaction a recent conversation with a longtime moderator: “He’s like, ‘As a shareholder, how are you thinking about growth?’ And I was just like, Oh, hallelujah.” Reddit’s most devoted volunteers, he says, “used to tell us not to grow.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Hey! Before we go any further — if you want to support my work, please sign up for the premium version of Where’s Your Ed At, it’s a $7-a-month (or $70-a-year) paid product where every week you get a premium newsletter, all while supporting my free work too. Also, subscribe to my podcast Better Offline, which is free. Go and subscribe then download every single episode. One last thing: This newsletter is nearly 14,500 words. It’s long. Perhaps consider making a pot of coffee before you start reading. Good journalism is making sure that history is actively captured and appropriately described and assessed, and it's accurate to describe things as they currently are as alarming. And I am alarmed. Alarm is not a state of weakness, or belligerence, or myopia. My concern does not dull my vision, even though it's convenient to frame it as somehow alarmist, like I have some hidden agenda or bias toward doom. I profoundly dislike the financial waste, the environmental destruction, and, fundamentally, I dislike the attempt to gaslight people into swearing fealty to a sickly and frail psuedo-industry where everybody but NVIDIA and consultancies lose money. I also dislike the fact that I, and others like me, are held to a remarkably different standard to those who paint themselves as "optimists," which typically means "people that agree with what the market wishes were true." Critics are continually badgered, prodded, poked, mocked, and jeered at for not automatically aligning with the idea that generative AI will be this massive industry, constantly having to prove themselves, as if somehow there's something malevolent or craven about criticism, that critics "do this for clicks" or "to be a contrarian." I don't do anything for clicks. I don't have any stocks or short positions. My agenda is simple: I like writing, it comes to me naturally, I have a podcast, and it is, on some level, my job to try and understand what the tech industry is doing on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to try and dismiss what I say as going against the grain because "AI is big," but I've been railing against bullshit bubbles since 2021 — the anti-remote work push (and the people behind it), the Clubhouse and audio social networks bubble, the NFT bubble, the made-up quiet quitting panic, and I even, though not as clearly as I wished, called that something was up with FTX several months before it imploded. This isn't "contrarianism." It's the kind of skepticism of power and capital that's necessary to meet these moments, and if it's necessary to dismiss my work because it makes you feel icky inside, get a therapist or see a priest. Nevertheless, I am alarmed, and while I have said some of these things separately, based on recent developments, I think it's necessary to say why. In short, I believe the AI bubble is deeply unstable, built on vibes and blind faith, and when I say "the AI bubble," I mean the entirety of the AI trade. And it's alarmingly simple, too. But this isn’t going to be saccharine, or whiny, or simply worrisome. I think at this point it’s become a little ridiculous to not see that we’re in a bubble. We’re in a god damn bubble, it is so obvious we’re in a bubble, it’s been so obvious we’re in a bubble, a bubble that seems strong but is actually very weak, with a central point of failure. I may not be a contrarian, but I am a hater. I hate the waste, the loss, the destruction, the theft, the damage to our planet and the sheer excitement that some executives and writers have that workers may be replaced by AI — and the bald-faced fucking lie that it’s happening, and that generative AI is capable of doing so. And so I present to you — the Hater’s Guide to the AI bubble, a comprehensive rundown of arguments I have against the current AI boom’s existence. Send it to your friends, your loved ones, or print it out and eat it. No, this isn’t gonna be a traditional guide, but something you can look at and say “oh that’s why the AI bubble is so bad.” And at this point, I know I’m tired of being gaslit by guys in gingham shirts who desperately want to curry favour with other guys in gingham shirts but who also have PHDs. I’m tired of reading people talk about how we’re “in the era of agents” that don’t fucking work and will never fucking work. I’m tired of hearing about “powerful AI” that is actually crap, and I’m tired of being told the future is here while having the world’s least-useful most-expensive cloud software shoved down my throat. Look, the generative AI boom is a mirage, it hasn’t got the revenue or the returns or the product efficacy for it to matter, everything you’re seeing is ridiculous and wasteful, and when it all goes tits up I want you to remember that I wrote this and tried to say something. As I write this, NVIDIA is currently sitting at $170 a share — a dramatic reversal of fate after the pummelling it took from the DeepSeek situation in January, which sent it tumbling to a brief late-April trip below $100 before things turned around. The Magnificent 7 stocks — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta, Tesla and Amazon — make up around 35% of the value of the US stock market, and of that, NVIDIA's market value makes up about 19% of the Magnificent 7. This dominance is also why ordinary people ought to be deeply concerned about the AI bubble. The Magnificent 7 is almost certainly a big part of their retirement plans, even if they’re not directly invested. Back in May, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reported that Microsoft (18.9%), Amazon (7.5%), Meta (9.3%), Alphabet (5.6%), and Tesla (0.9%) alone make up 42.4% of NVIDIA's revenue. The breakdown makes things worse. Meta spends 25% — and Microsoft an alarming 47% — of its capital expenditures on NVIDIA chips, and as Bratton notes, Microsoft also spends money renting servers from CoreWeave, which analyst Gil Luria of D.A.Davidson estimates accounted for $8 billion (more than 6%) of NVIDIA's revenue in 2024. Luria also estimates that neocloud companies like CoreWeave and Crusoe — that exist only to prove AI compute services — account for as much as 10% of NVIDIA's revenue. NVIDIA's climbing stock value comes from its continued revenue growth. In the last four quarters, NVIDIA has seen year-over-year growth of 101%, 94%, 78% and 69%, and, in the last quarter, a little statistic was carefully brushed under the rug: that NVIDIA missed, though narrowly, on data center revenue. This is exactly what it sounds like — GPUs that are used in servers, rather than gaming consoles and PCs (. Analysts estimated it would make $39.4 billion from this category, and NVIDIA only (lol) brought in $39.1 billion. Then again, it could be attributed to its problems in China, especially as the H20 ban has only just been lifted. In any case, it was a miss! NVIDIA's quarter-over-quarter growth has also become aggressively normal — from 69%, to 59%, to 12%, to 12% again each quarter, which, again, isn't bad (it's pretty great!), but when 88% of your revenue is based on one particular line in your earnings, it's a pretty big concern, at least for me. Look, I'm not a stock analyst, nor am I pretending to be one, so I am keeping this simple: In simpler terms, 35% of the US stock market is held up by five or six companies buying GPUs. If NVIDIA's growth story stumbles, it will reverberate through the rest of the Magnificent 7, making them rely on their own AI trade stories. And, as you will shortly find out, there is no AI trade, because generative AI is not making anybody any money. I'm so tired of people telling me that companies are "making tons of money on AI." Nobody is making a profit on generative AI other than NVIDIA. No, really, I’m serious. If they keep their promises, by the end of 2025, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Tesla will have spent over $560 billion in capital expenditures on AI in the last two years, all to make around $35 billion. This is egregiously fucking stupid. As of January 2025, Microsoft's "annualized" — meaning [best month]x12 — revenue from artificial intelligence was around $13 billion, a number that it chose not to update in its last earnings, likely because it's either flat or not growing, though it could in its upcoming late-July earnings. Yet the problem with this revenue is that $10 billion of that revenue, according to The Information, comes from OpenAI's spend on Microsoft's Azure cloud, and Microsoft offers preferential pricing — "a heavily discounted rental rate that essentially only covers Microsoft's costs for operating the servers" according to The Information. In simpler terms, 76.9% of Microsoft's AI revenue comes from OpenAI, and is sold at just above or at cost, making Microsoft's "real" AI revenue about $3 billion, or around 3.75% of this year's capital expenditures, or 16.25% if you count OpenAI's revenue, which costs Microsoft more money than it earns. The Information reports that Microsoft made $4.7 billion in "AI revenue" in 2024, of which OpenAI accounted for $2 billion, meaning that for the $135.7 billion that Microsoft has spent in the last two years on AI infrastructure, it has made $17.7 billion, of which OpenAI accounted for $12.7 billion. Things do not improve elsewhere. An analyst estimates that Amazon, which plans to spend $105 billion in capital expenditures this year, will make $5 billion on AI in 2025, rising, and I quote, "as much as 80%," suggesting that Amazon may have made a measly $2.77 billion in 2024 on AI in a year when it spent $83 billion in capital expenditures. [editor's note: this piece originally said "$1 billion" instead of "$2.77 billion" due to a math error, sorry!] Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." I think he's full of shit. Bank of America analyst Justin Post estimated a few weeks ago that Google's AI revenue would be in the region of $7.7 billion, though his math is, if I'm honest, a little generous: Google's "One" subscription includes increased cloud storage across Google Drive, Gmail and Google Photos, and added a $20-a-month "premium" plan in February 2024 that included access to Google's various AI models. Google has claimed that the "premium AI tier accounts for millions" of the 150 million subscribers to the service, though how many millions is impossible to estimate — but that won't stop me trying! Assuming that $3.1 billion in 2025 revenue would work out to $258 million a month, that would mean there were 12.9 million Google One subscribers also paying for the premium AI tier. This isn't out of the realm of possibility — after all, OpenAI has 15.5 million paying subscribers — but Post is making a generous assumption here. Nevertheless, we'll accept the numbers as they are. And the numbers fuckin' stink! Google's $1.1 billion in workspace service revenue came from a forced price-hike on those who use Google services to run their businesses, meaning that this is likely not a number that can significantly increase without punishing them further. $7.7 billion of revenue — not profit! — on $75 billion of capital expenditures. Nasty! Someone's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but I believe that Meta is simply burning cash on generative AI. There is no product that Meta sells that monetizes Large Language Models, but every Meta product now has them shoved into them, such as your Instagram DMs oinking at you to generate artwork based on your conversation. Nevertheless, we do have some sort of knowledge of what Meta is saying due to the copyright infringement case Kadrey v. Meta. Unsealed judgment briefs revealed in April that Meta is claiming that "GenAI-driven revenue will be more than $2 billion," with estimates as high as $3 billion. The same document also claims that Meta expects to make $460 billion to $1.4 trillion in total revenue through 2035, the kind of thing that should get you fired in an iron ball into the sun. Meta makes 99% of its revenue from advertising, and the unsealed documents state that it "[generates] revenue from [its] Llama models and will continue earning revenue from each iteration," and "share a percentage of the revenue that [it generates] from users of the Llama models...hosted by those companies," with the companies in question redacted. Max Zeff of TechCrunch adds that Meta lists host partners like AWS, NVIDIA, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake, so it's possible that Meta makes money from licensing to those companies. Sadly, the exhibits further discussing these numbers are filed under seal. Either way, we are now at $332 billion of capital expenditures in 2025 for $28.7 billion of revenue, of which $10 billion is OpenAI's "at-cost or just above cost" revenue. Not great. Despite its prominence in the magnificent 7, Tesla is one of the least-exposed of the magnificent 7 to the AI trade, as Elon Musk has turned it into a meme stock company. That doesn't mean, of course, that Musk isn't touching AI. xAI, the company that develops racist Large Language Model "Grok" and owns what remains of Twitter, apparently burns $1 billion a month, and The Information reports that it makes a whopping $100 million in annualized revenue — so, about $8.33 million a month. There is a shareholder vote for Tesla to potentially invest in xAI, which will probably happen, allowing Musk to continue to pull leverage from his Tesla stock until the company's decaying sales and brand eventually swallow him whole. But we're not talking about Elon Musk today. Apple Intelligence radicalized millions of people against AI, mostly because it fucking stank. Apple clearly got into AI reluctantly, and now faces stories about how they "fell behind in the AI race," which mostly means that Apple aggressively introduced people to the features of generative AI by force, and it turns out that people don't really want to summarize documents, write emails, or make "custom emoji," and anyone who thinks they would is a fucking alien. In any case, Apple hasn't bet the farm on AI, insomuch as it hasn't spent two hundred billion dollars on infrastructure for a product with a limited market that only loses money. To be clear, I am not saying that any of the Magnificent 7 are going to die — just that five companies' spend on NVIDIA GPUs largely dictate how stable the US stock market will be. If any of these companies (but especially NVIDIA) sneeze, your 401k or your kid’s college fund will catch a cold. I realize this sounds a little simplistic, but by my calculations, NVIDIA's value underpins around 8% of the value of the US stock market. At the time of writing, it accounts for roughly 7.5% of the S&P 500 — an index of the 500 largest US publicly-traded companies. A disturbing 88% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from enterprise-scale GPUs primarily used for generative AI, of which five companies' spend makes up 42% of its revenue. In the event that any one of these companies makes significant changes to their investments in NVIDIA chips, it will eventually have a direct and meaningful negative impact on the wider market. NVIDIA's earnings are, effectively, the US stock market's confidence, and everything rides on five companies — and if we're honest, really four companies — buying GPUs for generative AI services or to train generative AI models. Worse still, these services, while losing these companies massive amounts of money, don't produce much revenue, meaning that the AI trade is not driving any real, meaningful revenue growth. Silence! Any of these companies talking about "growth from AI" or "the jobs that AI will replace" or "how AI has changed their organization" are hand-waving to avoid telling you how much money these services are actually making them. If they were making good money and experiencing real growth as a result of these services, they wouldn't shut the fuck up about it! They'd be in your ear and up your ass hooting about how much cash they were rolling in! And they're not, because they aren't rolling in cash, and are in fact blowing nearly a hundred billion dollars each to build massive, power-hungry, costly data centers for no real reason. Don’t watch the mouth — watch the hands. These companies are going to say they’re seeing growth from AI, but unless they actually show you the growth and enumerate it, they are hand-waving. So, one of the most annoying and consistent responses to my work is to say that either Amazon or Amazon Web Services “ran at a loss,” and that Amazon Web Services — the invention of modern cloud computing infrastructure — “lost money and then didn’t.” The thing is, this statement is one of those things that people say because it sounds rational. Amazon did lose money, and Amazon Web Services was expensive, that’s obvious, right? The thing is, I’ve never really had anyone explain this point to me, so I am finally going to sit down and deal with this criticism, because every single person who mentions it thinks they just pulled Excalibur from the stone and can now decapitate me. They claim that because people in the past doubted Amazon — because, or in addition to the burn rate of Amazon Web Services as the company built out its infrastructure — that I too am wrong, because they were wrong about that. This isn't Camelot, you rube! You are not King Arthur! I will address both the argument itself and the "they" part of it too — because if the argument is that the people that got AWS wrong should not be trusted, then we should no longer trust them, the people actively propagandizing our supposed generative AI future. Right? So, I'm honestly not sure where this argument came from, because there is, to my knowledge, no story about Amazon Web Services where somebody suggested its burnrate would kill Amazon. But let’s go back in time to the May 31 1999 piece that some might be thinking of, called "Amazon.bomb," and how writer Jacqueline Doherty was mocked soundly for "being wrong" about Amazon, which has now become quite profitable. I also want to be clear that Amazon Web Services didn't launch until 2006, and Amazon itself would become reliably profitable in 2003. Technically Amazon had opened up Amazon.com's web services for developers to incorporate its content into their applications in 2002, but what we consider AWS today — cloud storage and compute — launched in 2006. But okay, what did she actually say? Her argument, for the most part, is that Amazon was burning cash, had a ton of competition from other people doing similar things, and that analysts backed her up: Fair arguments for the time, though perhaps a little narrow-minded. The assumption wasn't that what Amazon was building was a bad idea, but that Amazon wouldn't be the ones to build it, with one saying: In simpler terms: Amazon's business model wasn't in question. People were buying shit online. In fact, this was just before the dot com bubble burst, and when optimism about the web was at a high point. Yet the comparison stops there — people obviously liked buying shit online, it was the business models of many of these companies — like WebVan — that sucked. Amazon Web Services was an outgrowth of Amazon's own infrastructure, which had to expand rapidly to deal with the influx of web traffic for Amazon.com, which had become one of the world's most popular websites and was becoming increasingly more-complex as it sold things other than books. Other companies had their own infrastructure, but if a smaller company wanted to scale, they’d basically need to build their own thing. It's actually pretty cool what Amazon did! Remember, this was the early 2000s, before Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of the modern internet we know that runs on services like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. It invented the modern concept of compute! But we're here to talk about Amazon Web Services being dangerous for Amazon and people hating on it. A November 2006 story from Bloomberg talked about Jeff Bezos' Risky Bet to "run your business with the technology behind his web site," saying that "Wall Street [wanted] him to mind the store." Bezos, referred to as a "one-time internet poster boy" that became "a post-dot-com piñata." Nevertheless, this article has what my haters crave: Pretty bad, right? My goose is cooked? All those analysts seem pretty mad! Except it's not, my goose is raw! Yours, however, has been in the oven for over a year! Emphasis mine: That's right — the ongoing costs aren't the problem. Hey wait a second, that's a name! I can look up a name! Scott W. Devitt now works at Wedbush as its managing director of equity research, and has said AI companies would enter a new stage in 2025...god, just read this: The analyst says the market will enter phase two in 2025, with software companies and cloud provider stocks expected to see gains. He adds that cybersecurity companies could also benefit as the technology evolves. Dewitt specifically calls out Palantir, Snowflake, and Salesforce as those who would "gain." In none of these cases am I able to see the actual revenue from AI, but Salesforce itself said that it will see no revenue growth from AI this year. Palantir also, as discovered by the Autonomy Institute’s recent study, recently added to the following to its public disclosures: What I'm saying is that analysts can be wrong! And they can be wrong at scale! There is no analyst consensus that agrees with me. In fact, most analysts appear to be bullish on AI, despite the significantly-worse costs and total lack of growth! Yet even in this Hater's Parade, the unnamed journalist makes a case for Amazon Web Services: Nice try, chuckles! In 2015, the year that Amazon Web Services became profitable, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty believed that it was running at a "material loss," suggesting that $5.5 billion of Amazon's "technology and content expenses" was actually AWS expenses, with a "negative contribution of $1.3 billion." Here is Katy Huberty, the analyst in question, declaring six months ago that "2025 [will] be the year of Agentic AI, robust enterprise adoption, and broadening AI winners." So, yes, analysts really got AWS wrong. But putting that aside, there might actually be a comparison here! Amazon Web Services absolutely created a capital expenditures drain on Amazon. From Forbes’s Chuck Jones: In today's money, this means that Amazon spent $6.76 billion in capital expenditures on AWS in 2014. Assuming it was this much every year — it wasn't, but I want to make an example of every person claiming that this is a gotcha — it took $67.6 billion and ten years (though one could argue it was nine) of pure capital expenditures to turn Amazon Web Services into a business that now makes billions of dollars a quarter in profit. That's $15.4 billion less than Amazon's capital expenditures for 2024, and less than one-fifteenth its projected capex spend for 2025. And to be clear, the actual capital expenditure numbers are likely much lower, but I want to make it clear that even when factoring in inflation, Amazon Web Services was A) a bargain and B) a fraction of the cost of what Amazon has spent in 2024 or 2025. Some people compare Large Language Models and their associated services to Amazon Web Services, or services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and they are wrong to do so. Amazon Web Services, when it launched, comprised of things like (and forgive how much I'm diluting this) Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), where you rent space on Amazon's servers to run applications in the cloud, or Amazon Simple Storage (S3), which is enterprise-level storage for applications. In simpler terms, if you were providing a cloud-based service, you used Amazon to both store the stuff that the service needed and the actual cloud-based processing (compute, so like your computer loads and runs applications but delivered to thousands or millions of people). This is a huge industry. Amazon Web Services alone brought in revenues of over $100 billion in 2024, and while Microsoft and Google don't break out their cloud revenues, they're similarly large parts of their revenue, and Microsoft has used Azure in the past to patch over shoddy growth. These services are also selling infrastructure. You aren't just paying for the compute, but the ability to access storage and deliver services with low latency — so users have a snappy experience — wherever they are in the world. The subtle magic of the internet is that it works at all, and a large part of that is the cloud compute infrastructure and oligopoly of the main providers having such vast data centers. This is much cheaper than doing it yourself, until a certain point. Dropbox moved away from Amazon Web Services as it scaled. It also allows someone else to take care of maintenance of the hardware and make sure it actually gets to your customers. You also don't have to worry about spikes in usage, because these things are usage-based, and you can always add more compute to meet demand. There is, of course, nuance — security-specific features, content-specific delivery services, database services — behind these clouds. You are buying into the infrastructure of the infrastructure provider, and the reason these products are so profitable is, in part, because you are handing off the problems and responsibility to somebody else. And based on that idea, there are multiple product categories you can build on top of it, because ultimately cloud services are about Amazon, Microsoft and Google running your infrastructure for you. Large Language Models and their associated services are completely different, despite these companies attempting to prove otherwise, and it starts with a very simple problem: why did any of these companies build these giant data centers and fill them full of GPUs? Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. And that appears to be the only similarity with generative AI — that due to the ridiculous costs of both the data centers and GPUs necessary to provide these services, it's largely impossible for others to even enter the market. Yet after that, generative AI feels more like a feature of cloud infrastructure rather than infrastructure itself. AWS and similar megaclouds are versatile, flexible and multifaceted. Generative AI does what generative AI does, and that's about it. You can run lots of different things on AWS. What are the different things you can run using Large Language Models? What are the different use cases, and, indeed, user requirements that make this the supposed "next big thing"? Perhaps the argument is that generative AI is the next AWS or similar cloud service because you can build the next great companies on the infrastructure of others — the models of, say, OpenAI and Anthropic, and the servers of Microsoft. So, okay, let's humour this point too. You can build the next great AI startup, and you have to build it on one of the megclouds because they're the only ones that can afford to build the infrastructure. One small problem. Let's start by establishing a few facts: None of this is to say that one hundred million dollars isn't a lot of money to you and me, but in the world of Software-as-Service or enterprise software, this is chump change. Hubspot had revenues of $2.63 billion in its 2024 financial year. We're three years in, and generative AI's highest-grossing companies — outside OpenAI ($10 billion annualized as of early June) and Anthropic ($4 billion annualized as of July), and both lose billions a year after revenue — have three major problems: But let's start with Anysphere and Cursor, its AI-powered coding app, and its $500 million of annualized revenue. Pretty great, right? It hit $200 million in annualized revenue in March, then hit $500 million annualized revenue in June after raising $900 million. That's amazing! Sadly, it's a mirage. Cursor's growth was a result of an unsustainable business model that it’s now had to replace with opaque terms of service, dramatically restricted access to models, and rate limits that effectively stop its users using the product at the price point they were used to. It’s also horribly unprofitable, and a sign of things to come for generative AI. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote up the dramatic changes that Cursor made to its service in the middle of June on my premium newsletter, and discovered that they timed precisely with Anthropic (and OpenAI to a lesser extent) adding "service tiers" and "priority processing," which is tech language for "pay us extra if you have a lot of customers or face rate limits or service delays." These price shifts have also led to companies like Replit having to make significant changes to its pricing model that disfavor users. I will now plagiarise myself: In simpler terms, Cursor raised $900 million and very likely had to hand large amounts of that money over to OpenAI and Anthropic to keep doing business with them, and then immediately changed its terms of service to make them worse. As I said at the time: Cursor is the largest and most-successful generative AI company, and these aggressive and desperate changes to its product suggest A) that its product is deeply unprofitable and B) that its current growth was a result of offering a product that was not the one it would sell in the long term. Cursor misled its customers, and its current revenue is, as a result, highly unlikely to stay at this level. Worse still, the two Anthropic engineers who left to join Cursor two weeks ago just returned to Anthropic. This heavily suggests that whatever they saw at Cursor wasn’t compelling enough to make them stay. As I also said: I realize it's likely a little boring hearing about software as a service, but this is the only place where generative AI can really make money. Companies buying hundreds or thousands of seats are how industries that rely upon compute grow, and without that growth, they're going nowhere. To give you some context, Netflix makes about $39 billion a year in subscription revenue, and Spotify about $18 billion. These are the single-most-popular consumer software subscriptions in the world — and OpenAI's 15.5 million subscribers suggest that it can't rely on them for the kind of growth that would actually make the company worth $300 billion (or more). Cursor is, as it stands, the one example of a company thriving using generative AI, and it appears its rapid growth was a result of selling a product at a massive loss. As it stands today, Cursor's product is significantly worse, and its Reddit is full of people furious at the company for the changes. In simpler terms, Cursor was the company that people mentioned to prove that startups could make money by building products on top of OpenAI and Anthropic's models, yet the truth is that the only way to do so and grow is to burn tons of money. While the tempting argument is to say that Cursor’s "customers are addicted," this is clearly not the case, nor is it a real business model. This story also showed that Anthropic and OpenAI are the biggest threats to their customers, and will actively rent-seek and punish their success stories, looking to loot as much as they can from them. To put it bluntly: Cursor's growth story was a lie. It reached $500 million in annualized revenue selling a product it can no longer afford to sell, suggesting material weakness in its own business and any and all coding startups. It is also remarkable — and a shocking failure of journalism — that this isn’t in every single article about Anysphere. I'm serious! Perplexity? Perplexity only has $150 million in annualized revenue! It spent 167% of its revenue in 2024 ($57m, its revenue was $34m) on compute services from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon! It lost $68 million! And worse still, it has no path to profitability, and it’s not even anything new! It’s a search engine! Professional gasbag Alex Heath just did a flummoxing interview with Perplexity CEO Aravind Srivinas, who, when asked how it’d become profitable, appeared to experience a stroke: Aravind, do you smell toast? And don’t talk to me about “AI browsers,” I’m sorry, it’s not a business model. How are people going to make revenue on this, hm? What do these products actually do? Oh they can poorly automate accepting LinkedIn invites? It’s like God himself has personally blessed my computer. Big deal! In any case, it doesn't seem like you can really build a consumer AI startup that makes anything approaching a real company. Other than ChatGPT, I guess? Arguably the biggest sign that things are troubling in the generative AI space is that we use "annualized revenue" at all, which, as I've mentioned repeatedly, means multiplying a month by 12 and saying "that's our annualized!" The problem with this number is that, well, people cancel things. While your June might be great, if 10% of your subscribers churn in a bad month (due to a change in your terms of service), that's a chunk of your annualized revenue gone. But the worst sign is that nobody is saying the monthly figures, mostly because the monthly figures kinda suck! $100 million of annualized revenue is $8.33 million a month. To give you some scale, Amazon Web Services hit $189 million ($15.75 million a month) in revenue in 2008, two years after founding, and while it took until 2015 to hit profitability, it actually hit break-even in 2009, though it invested cash in growth for a few years after. Right now, not a single generative AI software company is profitable, and none of them are showing the signs of the kind of hypergrowth that previous "big" software companies had. While Cursor is technically "the fastest growing SaaS of all time," it did so using what amounts to fake pricing. You can dress this up as "growth stage" or "enshittification (it isn't by the way, generally price changes make things profitable, which this did not)," but Cursor lied. It lied to the public about what its product would do long-term. It isn't even obvious whether its current pricing is sustainable. Outside of Cursor, what other software startups are there? Glean? Everyone loves to talk about enterprise search company Glean — a company that uses AI to search and generate answers from your company's files and documents. In December 2024, Glean raised $260 million, proudly stating that it had over $550 million of cash in hand with "best-in-class ARR growth." A few months later in February 2025, Glean announced it’d "achieved $100 million in annual recurring revenue in fourth quarter FY25, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups and reflecting a surging demand for AI-powered workplace intelligence." In this case, ARR could literally mean anything, as it appears to be based on quarters — meaning it could be an average of the last three months of the year, I guess? Anywho, in June 2025, Glean announced it had raised another funding round, this time raising $150 million, and, troublingly, added that since its last round, it had "...surpassed $100M in ARR." Five months into the fucking year and your monthly revenue is the same? That isn't good! That isn't good at all! Also, what happened to that $550 million in cash? Why did Glean need more? Hey wait a second, Glean announced its raise on June 18 2025, two days after Cursor's pricing increase and the same day that Replit announced a similar hike! It's almost as if its pricing dramatically increased due to the introduction of Anthropic's Service Tiers and OpenAI's Priority Processing. I'm guessing, but isn't it kind of weird that all of these companies raised money about the same time? Hey, that reminds me. If you look at what generative AI companies do (note that the following is not a quality barometer), it's probably doing one of the following things: Every single generative AI company that isn't OpenAI or Anthropic does one or a few of these things, and I mean every one of them, and it's because every single generative AI company uses Large Language Models, which have inherent limits on what they can do. LLMs can generate, they can search, they can edit (kind of!), they can transcribe (sometimes accurately!) and they can translate (often less accurately). As a result, it's very, very difficult for a company to build something unique. Though Cursor is successful, it is ultimately a series of system prompts, a custom model that its users hate, a user interface and connections to models by OpenAI and Anthropic, both of whom have competing products and make money from Cursor and its competitors. Within weeks of Cursor's changes to its services, Amazon and ByteDance released competitors that, for the most part, do the same thing. Sure there's a few differences in how they're designed, but design is not a moat, especially in a high-cost, negative-profit business, where your only way of growing is to offer a product you can't afford to sustain. The only other moat you can build..is the services you provide, which, when your services are dependent on a Large Language Model, are dependent on the model developer, who, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic, could simply clone your startup, because the only valuable intellectual property is theirs. You may say "well, nobody else has any ideas either," to which I'll say that I fully agree. My Rot-Com Bubble thesis suggests we're out of hypergrowth ideas, and yeah, I think we're out of ideas related to Large Language Models too. At this point, I think it's fair to ask — are there any good companies you can build on top of Large Language Models? I don't mean add features related to, I mean an AI company that actually sells a product that people buy at scale that isn't called ChatGPT. In previous tech booms, companies would make their own “models” — their own infrastructure, or the things that make them distinct from other companies — but the generative AI boom effectively changes that by making everybody build stuff on top of somebody else’s models, because training your own models is both extremely expensive and requires vast amounts of infrastructure. As a result, much of this “boom” is about a few companies — really two, if we’re honest — getting other companies to try and build functional software for them. I wanted to add one note — that, ultimately, OpenAI and Anthropic are bad for their customers. Their models are popular (by which I mean their customers' customers will expect access to them) meaning that OpenAI and Anthropic can (as they did with Cursor) arbitrarily change pricing, service availability or functionality based on how they feel that day. Don't believe me? Anthropic cut off access to AI coding platform Windsurf because it looked like it might get acquired by OpenAI. Even by big tech standards this fucking sucks. And these companies will do it again! Because all Large Language Models require more data than anyone has ever needed, they all basically have to use the same data, either taken from the internet or bought from one of a few companies (Scale, Surge, Turing, Together, etc.). While they can get customized data or do customized training/reinforcement learning, these models are all transformer-based, and they all function similarly, and the only way to make them different is by training them, which doesn't make them much different, just better at things they already do. I already mentioned OpenAI and Anthropic's costs, as well as Perplexity's $50 million+ bill to Anthropic, Amazon and OpenAI off of a measly $34 million in revenue. These companies cost too much to run, and their functionality doesn't make enough money to make them make sense. The problem isn't just the pricing, but how unpredictable it is. As Matt Ashare wrote for CIO Dive last year, generative AI makes a lot of companies’ lives difficult through the massive spikes in costs that come from power users, with few ways to mitigate their costs. One of the ways that a company manages their cloud bills is by having some degree of predictability — which is difficult to do with the constant slew of new models and demands for new products to go with them, especially when said models can (and do) cost more with subsequent iterations. As a result, it's hard for AI companies to actually budget. "But Ed!" you cry, "What about AGENTS?" Let me tell you about agents. The term "agent" is one of the most egregious acts of fraud I've seen in my entire career writing about this crap, and that includes the metaverse. When you hear the word "agent," you are meant to think of an autonomous AI that can go and do stuff without oversight, replacing somebody's job in the process, and companies have been pushing the boundaries of good taste and financial crimes in pursuit of them. Most egregious of them is Salesforce's "Agentforce," which lets you "deploy AI agents at scale" and "brings digital labor to every employee, department and business process." This is a blatant fucking lie. Agentforce is a god damn chatbot platform, it's for launching chatbots, they can sometimes plug into APIs that allow them to access other information, but they are neither autonomous nor "agents" by any reasonable definition. Not only does Salesforce not actually sell "agents," its own research shows that agents only achieve around a 58% success rate on single-step tasks, meaning, to quote The Register, "tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information." On multi-step tasks — so, you know, most tasks — they succeed a depressing 35% of the time. Last week, OpenAI announced its own "ChatGPT agent" that can allegedly go "do tasks" on a "virtual computer." In its own demo, the agent took 21 or so minutes to spit out a plan for a wedding with destinations, a vague calendar and some suit options, and then showed a pre-prepared demo of the "agent" preparing an itinerary of how to visit every major league ballpark. In this example's case, "agent" took 23 minutes, and produced arguably the most confusing-looking map I've seen in my life. It also missed out every single major league ballpark on the East Coast — including Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park — and added a random stadium in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. What team is that, eh Sam? The Deepwater Horizon Devils? Is there a baseball team in North Dakota? I should also be clear this was the pre-prepared example. As with every Large Language Model-based product — and yes, that's what this is, even if OpenAI won't talk about what model — results are extremely variable. Agents are difficult, because tasks are difficult, even if they can be completed by a human being that a CEO thinks is stupid. What OpenAI appears to be doing is using a virtual machine to run scripts that its models trigger. Regardless of how well it works (it works very very poorly and inconsistently), it's also likely very expensive. In any case, every single company you see using the word agent is trying to mislead you. Glean's "AI agents" are chatbots with if-this-then-that functions that trigger events using APIs (the connectors between different software services), not taking actual actions, because that is not what LLMs can do. ServiceNow's AI agents that allegedly "act autonomously and proactively on your behalf" are, despite claiming they "go beyond ‘better chatbots,’" still ultimately chatbots that use APIs to trigger different events using if-this-then-that functions. Sometimes these chatbots can also answer questions that people might have, or trigger an event somewhere. Oh, right, that's the same thing. The closest we have to an "agent" of any kind is a coding agent, which can make a list of things that you might do on a software project and then go and generate the code and push stuff to Github when you ask them to, and they can do so "autonomously," in the sense that you can let them just run whatever task seems right. When I say "ask them to" or "go and" I mean that these agents are not remotely intelligent, and when let run rampant fuck up everything and create a bunch of extra work. Also, a study found that AI coding tools made engineers 19% slower. Nevertheless, none of these products are autonomous agents, and anybody using the term agent likely means "chatbot." And it's working because the media keeps repeating everything these companies say. I realize we've taken kind of a scenic route here, but I needed to lay the groundwork here, because I am well and truly alarmed. According to a UBS report from the 26th of June, the public companies running AI services are making absolutely pathetic amounts of money from AI: ServiceNow's use of "$250 million ACV" — so annual contract value — may be one of the more honest explanations of revenue I've seen, putting them in the upper echelons of AI revenue unless, of course, you think for two seconds, whether these are AI-specific contracts. Or, perhaps, are they contracts including AI? Eh, who cares. It's also year-long agreements that could churn, and according to Gartner, over 40% of "agentic AI" projects will be canceled by end of 2027. And really, ya gotta laugh at Adobe and Salesforce, both of whom have talked so god damn much about generative AI and yet have only made around $100 million in annualized revenue from it. Pathetic! These aren't futuristic numbers! They're barely product categories! And none of this seems to include costs. Oh well. I haven't really spent time on my favourite subject — OpenAI being a systemic risk to the tech industry. To recap: Anthropic is in a similar, but slightly better position — it is set to lose $3 billion this year on $4 billion of revenue. It also has no path to profitability, recently jacked up prices on Cursor, its largest customer, and had to put restraints on Claude Code after allowing users to burn 100% to 10,000% of their revenue. These are the actions of a desperate company. Nevertheless, OpenAI and Anthropic's revenues amount to, by my estimates, more than half of the entire revenue of the generative AI industry, including the hyperscalers. To be abundantly clear: the two companies that amount to around half of all generative artificial intelligence revenue are ONLY LOSING MONEY. I've said a lot of this before, which is why I'm not harping on about it, but the most important company in the entire AI industry needs to convert by the end of the year or it's effectively dead, and even if it does, it burns billions and billions of dollars a year and will die without continual funding. It has no path to profitability, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar or a fantasist. Worse still, outside of OpenAI...what is there, really? As I wrote earlier in the year, there is really no significant adoption of generative AI services or products. ChatGPT has 500 million weekly users, and otherwise, it seems that other services struggle to get 15 million of them. And while the 500 million weekly users sounds — and, in fairness, is — impressive, there’s a world of difference between someone using a product as part of their job, and someone dicking around with an image generator, or a college student trying to cheat on their homework. Sidebar: Google cheated by combining Google Gemini with Google Assistant to claim that it has 350 million users. Don't care, sorry. This is worrying on so many levels, chief of which is that everybody has been talking about AI for three god damn years, everybody has said "AI" in every earnings and media appearance and exhausting blog post, and we still can't scrape together the bits needed to make a functional industry. I know some of you will probably read this and point to ChatGPT's users, and I quote myself here: It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. ChatGPT is a very successful growth product and an absolutely horrifying business. OpenAI is a banana republic that cannot function on its own, it does not resemble Uber, Amazon Web Services, or any other business in the past other than WeWork, the other company that SoftBank spent way too much money on. And outside of ChatGPT, there really isn't anything else. Before I wrap up — I'm tired, and I imagine you are too — I want to address something. Yes, generative AI has functionality. There are coding products and search products that people like and pay for. As I have discussed above, none of these companies are profitable, and until one of them is profitable, generative AI-based companies are not real businesses. In any case, the problem isn't so much that LLMs "don't do anything," but that people talk about them doing things they can't do. I believe that the generative AI market is a $50 billion revenue industry masquerading as a $1 trillion one, and the media is helping. As I've explained at length, the AI trade is not one based on revenue, user growth, the efficacy of tools or significance of any technological breakthrough. Stocks are not moving based on whether they are making money on AI, because if they were, they'd be moving downward. However, due to the vibes-based nature of the AI trade, companies are benefiting from the press inexplicably crediting growth to AI with no proof that that's the case. OpenAI is a terrible business, and the only businesses worse than OpenAI are the companies built on top of it. Large Language Models are too expensive to run, and have limited abilities beyond the ones I've named previously, and because everybody is running models that all, on some level, do the same thing, it's very hard for people to build really innovative products on top of them. And, ultimately, this entire trade hinges on GPUs. CoreWeave was initially funded by NVIDIA, its IPO funded partially by NVIDIA, NVIDIA is one of its customers, and CoreWeave raises debt on the GPUs it buys from NVIDIA to build more data centers, while also using the money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA. This isn’t me being polemic or hysterical — this is quite literally what is happening, and how CoreWeave operates. If you aren’t alarmed by that, I’m not sure what to tell you. Elsewhere, Oracle is buying $40 billion in GPUs for the still-unformed Stargate data center project, and Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data center to fill with NVIDIA GPUs. OpenAI is Microsoft's largest Azure client — an insanely risky proposition on multiple levels, not simply in the fact that it’s serving the revenue at-cost but that Microsoft executives believed OpenAI would fail in the long term when they invested in 2023 — and Microsoft is NVIDIA's largest client for GPUs, meaning that any changes to Microsoft's future interest in OpenAI, such as reducing its data center expansion, would eventually hit NVIDIA's revenue. Why do you think DeepSeek shocked the market? It wasn't because of any clunky story around training techniques. It was because it said to the market that NVIDIA might not sell more GPUs every single quarter in perpetuity. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla aren't making much money from AI — in fact, they're losing billions of dollars on whatever revenues they do make from it. Their stock growth is not coming from actual revenue, but the vibes around "being an AI company," which means absolutely jack shit when you don't have the users, finances, or products to back them up. So, really, everything comes down to NVIDIA's ability to sell GPUs, and this industry, if we're really honest, at this point only exists to do so. Generative AI products do not provide significant revenue growth, its products are not useful in the way that unlocks significant business value, and the products that have some adoption run at such a grotesque loss. I realize I've thrown a lot at you, and, for the second time this year, written the longest thing I've ever written. But I needed to write this, because I'm really worried. We're in a bubble. If you do not think we're in a bubble, you are not looking outside. Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Slok said it last week. Well, okay, what he said was much worse: We are in a bubble. Generative AI does not do the things that it's being sold as doing, and the things it can actually do aren't the kind of things that create business returns, automate labor, or really do much more than one extension of a cloud software platform. The money isn't there, the users aren't there, every company seems to lose money and some companies lose so much money that it's impossible to tell how they'll survive. Worse still, this bubble is entirely symbolic. The bailouts of the Great Financial Crisis were focused on banks and funds that had failed because they ran out of money, and the TARP initiative existed to plug the holes with low-interest loans. There are few holes to plug here, because even if OpenAI and Anthropic somehow became eternal money-burners, the AI trade exists based on the continued and continually-increasing sale and use of GPUs. There are limited amounts of capital, but also limited amounts of data centers to actually put GPUs, and on top of that, at some point growth will slow at one of the Magnificent 7, at which point costs will have to come down from things that lose them tons of money, such as generative AI. Before you ask- You do not have proof for this statement! The cost of tokens going down is not the same thing as the cost of inference goes down! Everyone saying this is saying it because a guy once said it to them! You don't have proof! I have more proof for what I am saying! While it theoretically might be, all evidence points to larger models costing more money, especially reasoning-heavy ones like Claude Opus 4. Inference is not the only thing happening, and if this is your one response, you are a big bozo and doofus and should go back to making squeaky noises when you see tech executives or hear my name. Okay, so one argument is that these companies will use ASICs — customized chips for specific operations — to reduce the amount they're spending. A few thoughts: I am worried because despite all of these obvious, brutal and near-unfixable problems, everybody is walking around acting like things are going great with AI. The New York Times claims everybody is using AI for everything — a blatant lie, one that exists to prop up an industry that has categorically failed to deliver the innovations or returns that it promised, yet still receives glowing press from a tech and business media that refuses to look outside and see that the sky is red and frogs are landing everywhere. Other than the frog thing, I'm not even being dramatic. Everywhere you look in the AI trade, things get worse — no revenue, billions being burned, no moat, no infrastructure play, no comparables in history other than the dot com bubble and WeWork, and a series of flagrant lies spouted by the powerful and members of the press that are afraid of moving against market consensus. Worse still, despite NVIDIA's strength, NVIDIA is the market's weakness, through no fault of its own, really. Jensen Huang sells GPUs, people want to buy GPUs, and now the rest of the market is leaning aggressively on one company, feeding it billions of dollars in the hopes that the things they're buying start making them a profit. And that really is the most ridiculous thing. At the center of the AI trade sits GPUs that, on installation, immediately start losing the company in question money. Large Language Models burn cash for negative returns to build products that all kind of work the same way. If you're going to say I'm wrong, sit and think carefully about why. Is it because you don't want me to be right? Is it because you think "these companies will work it out"? This isn't anything like Uber, AWS, or any other situation. It is its own monstrosity, a creature of hubris and ignorance caused by a tech industry that's run out of ideas, built on top of one company. You can plead with me all you want about how there are actual people using AI. You've probably read the "My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts" blog, and if you're gonna send it to me, read the response from Nik Suresh first. If you're going to say that I "don't speak to people who actually use these products," you are categorically wrong and in denial. I am only writing with this aggressive tone because, for the best part of two years, I have been made to repeatedly explain myself in a way that no AI "optimist" is made, and I admit I resent it. I have written hundreds of thousands of words with hundreds of citations, and still, to this day, there are people who claim I am somehow flawed in my analysis, that I'm missing something, that I am somehow failing to make my case. The only people failing to make their case are the AI optimists still claiming that these companies are making "powerful AI." And once this bubble pops, I will be asking for an apology. I love ending pieces with personal thoughts about stuff because I am an emotional and overly honest person, and I enjoy writing a lot. I do not, however, enjoy telling you at length how brittle everything is. An ideal tech industry would be one built on innovation, revenue, real growth based on actual business returns that helped humans be better, not outright lie about replacing them. All that generative AI has done is show how much lust there is in both the markets and the media for replacing human labor — and yes, it is in the media too. I truly believe there are multiple reporters who feel genuine excitement when they write scary stories about how Dario Amodei says white collar workers will be fired in the next few years in favour of "agents" that will never exist. Everything I’m discussing is the result of the Rot Economy thesis I wrote back in 2023 — the growth-at-all-costs mindset that has driven every tech company to focus on increasing quarterly revenue numbers, even if the products suck, or are deeply unprofitable, or, in the case of generative AI, both. Nowhere has there been a more pungent version of the Rot Economy than in Large Language Models, or more specifically GPUs. By making everything about growth, you inevitably reach a point where the only thing you know how to do is spend money, and both LLMs and GPUs allowed big tech to do the thing that worked before — building a bunch of data centers and buying a bunch of chips — without making sure they’d done the crucial work of “making sure this would create products people like.” As a result, we’re now sitting on top of one of the most brittle situations in economic history — our markets held up by whether four or five companies will continue to buy chips that start losing them money the second they’re installed. I am disgusted by how many people are unwilling or unable to engage with the truth, favouring instead a scornful, contemptuous tone toward anybody who doesn't believe that generative AI is the future. If you are a writer that writes about AI smarmily insulting people who "don't understand AI," you are a shitty fucking writer, because either AI isn't that good or you're not good at explaining why it's good. Perhaps it's both. If you want to know my true agenda, it's that I see something in generative AI and its boosters something I truly dislike. Large Language Models authoritatively state things that are incorrect because they have no concept of right or wrong. I believe that the writers, managers and executives that find it exciting do so because it gives them the ability to pretend to be intelligent without actually learning anything, to do everything they can to avoid actual work or responsibility for themselves or others. There is an overwhelming condescension that comes from fans of generative AI — the sense that they know something you don't, something they double down on. We are being forced to use it by bosses, or services we like that now insist it's part of our documents or our search engines, not because it does something, but because those pushing it need us to use it to prove that they know what's going on. To quote my editor Matt Hughes: "...generative AI...is an expression of contempt towards people, one that considers them to be a commodity at best, and a rapidly-depreciating asset at worst." I haven't quite cracked why, but generative AI also brings out the worst in some people. By giving the illusion of labor, it excites those who are desperate to replace or commoditize it. By giving the illusion of education, it excites those who are too idle to actually learn things by convincing them that in a few minutes they can learn quantum physics. By giving the illusion of activity, it allows the gluttony of Business Idiots that control everything to pretend that they do something. By giving the illusion of futurity, it gives reporters that have long-since disconnected from actual software and hardware the ability to pretend that they know what's happening in the tech industry. And, fundamentally, its biggest illusion is economic activity, because despite being questionably-useful and burning billions of dollars, its need to do so creates a justification for spending billions of dollars on GPUs and data center sprawl, which allows big tech to sink money into something and give the illusion of growth. I love writing, but I don't love writing this. I think I'm right, and it’s not something I’m necessarily happy about. If I'm wrong, I'll explain how I'm wrong in great detail, and not shy away from taking accountability, but I really do not think I am, and that's why I'm so alarmed. What I am describing is a bubble, and one with an obvious weakness: one company's ability to sell hardware to four or five other companies, all to run services that lose billions of dollars. At some point the momentum behind NVIDIA slows. Maybe it won't even be sales slowing — maybe it'll just be the suggestion that one of its largest customers won't be buying as many GPUs. Perception matters just as much as actual numbers, and sometimes more, and a shift in sentiment could start a chain of events that knocks down the entire house of cards. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I really, really don't know how I'm wrong. I hate that so many people will see their retirements wrecked, and that so many people intentionally or accidentally helped steer the market in this reckless, needless and wasteful direction, all because big tech didn’t have a new way to show quarterly growth. I hate that so many people have lost their jobs because companies are spending the equivalent of the entire GDP of some European countries on data centers and GPUs that won’t actually deliver any value. But my purpose here is to explain to you, no matter your background or interests or creed or whatever way you found my work, why it happened. As you watch this collapse, I want you to tell your friends about why — the people responsible and the decisions they made — and make sure it’s clear that there are people responsible. Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Andy Jassy have overseen a needless, wasteful and destructive economic force that will harm our markets (and by a larger extension our economy) and the tech industry writ large, and when this is over, they must be held accountable. And remember that you, as a regular person, can understand all of this. These people want you to believe this is black magic, that you are wrong to worry about the billions wasted or question the usefulness of these tools. You are smarter than they reckon and stronger than they know, and a better future is one where you recognize this, and realize that power and money doesn’t make a man righteous, right, or smart. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers, and I now have 67,000 and a growing premium subscriber base. I am grateful for the time you’ve given me, and really hope that I continue to help you see the tech industry for what it currently is — captured almost entirely by people that have no interest in building the future.
