Planned taxi protests were called off earlier this week pending the outcome of a meeting at Government Buildings.

A Department of Transport spokesperson revealed, however, that the minister has ordered a new assessment of licensing regulations in the wake of highly disruptive protests by taxi drivers opposed to the new rules. Mr O’Brien has asked the National Transport Authority (NTA) to carry out the review. It will examine the regulations including the role of booking apps and the technology used for charges. The move comes after the Taxi Drivers Ireland group suspended “go-slow” protests that could have caused major traffic disruption this week to enter talks. A spokesperson at Taxi Drivers Ireland said earlier this week that a further escalation of protest action was temporarily called off pending the outcome of a meeting at Government Buildings. The drivers had announced a “six-day national shutdown protest”. They called for government engagement on the future of the industry, claiming the Uber fixed-fare policy is destroying their livelihoods. When asked about the outcome of talks, a department spokesperson said a special meeting of an Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles took place on Thursday.

The spokesperson said the minister was advised that the NTA will keep the regulatory model under review. Mr O’Brien asked that the matter was urgently considered at the special meeting of an Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles. Members of the committee include representatives of drivers, operators, consumer representatives, An Garda Síochána and the tourism sector. The committee recommended that more dispatch operator data is made available to the regulator and an examination of “technology charges” takes place. A department spokesperson said the committee expressed support for the regulatory model for small public service vehicles in Ireland which requires that all drivers and vehicles are licensed. “The committee is of the view that given changes in the taxi sector since the taxi regulation act 2013, there is a need to assess whether legislation is up to date regarding the roles of technology and booking app dispatch operators in the sector.” The department spokesperson said the SPSV (small public service vehicles) market “has undoubtedly changed” over the last number of years. “With this in mind, the minister has requested that the NTA conducts a regulatory assessment of dispatch operator licensing in Ireland in the context of ensuring that the regulatory framework for this element of the overall sector is sufficiently up to date and robust to respond to developments in the SPSV market since the enactment of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013,” the spokesperson said.
