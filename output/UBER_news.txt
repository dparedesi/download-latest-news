In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

Title: New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/ai-large-loads-2000676957
Time Published: 2025-10-25T14:00:39Z
Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid. In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote: “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” He added: “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.” The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebius—which most of us had never heard of twelve months ago—are in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to say—for the moment—it really pays to have a lot of servers.

It's getting harder to tell which unhinged Trump tweets are real. Trump ran as the bitcoin president, but stablecoins and crypto grifting have taken priority.

Title: Insiders Are Scooping Up Shares of a Miner, a Driller, and a Biotech

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 While insider buying is typically slower when markets are near all-time highs and when earnings-reporting season is in full swing, it never seems to dry up altogether. A few notable purchases in the past week or so attest to this. A beneficial owner took advantage of a public offer to increase a stake in a gold and silver miner, while another showed some love for a struggling offshore driller. The chief executives of a biotech also continued acquiring shares. Let’s take a quick look at these notable transactions in the past week or so. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is all the more so during times of uncertainty in the markets, and even when markets are near all-time highs. With the third-quarter earnings-reporting season underway, many insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This transaction was part of a public offering of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: HYMC) stock that raised approximately $150 million. The Nevada-based miner subsequently announced that it had extinguished all its remaining debt. The stock is almost 88% higher than 90 days ago and was last seen trading almost a dollar per share higher than the buyer’s purchase price. The share price is up 167.6% year over year. The stock has little analyst coverage and no Buy ratings. Yet, the consensus price target is up at $13.61. Note that this Canadian billionaire previously purchased $62 million worth of the shares this summer. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) stock recently sank to a 52-week low below $12 as the Houston-based company faces multiple legal and regulatory issues. Shares were last seen trading well below the purchase price range above. The offshore oil and gas field operations provider has a mean price target of $39.20, which would be a gain of 207.9% in the next 12 months. All five analysts who cover the stock recommend buying shares. Roth Capital recently reiterated its Buy rating. Note that this buyer’s stake is up to more than 10.9 million shares. Also note that about 24% of all shares are held short. These transactions were part of a private placement. Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and the stock has retreated 8.1% in the past week. The Miami-based biopharmaceutical company also recently announced the expansion of Phase 3 trials of its colorectal cancer treatment. Despite recent declines, the stock is still up 8.2% year to date and trading for more than the purchase price above. The $31.80 mean price target is less than the $36.91 52-week high, but that target represents a gain of 60.0% in the coming year. Analysts on average recommend buying shares. Co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh also purchased shares last month. catnap72 / Getty Images These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week or so. Here’s a quick look at some others. Recently, some smaller insider buying was reported at Commercial Metals, Denny’s, Fastenal, Fifth Third Bancorp, Heico, Synovus Financial, Toll Brothers, and Uber, as well.

Title: “Is It Really A Common Thing?”: 25 Popular American Myths Go Under The Microscope
URL: https://www.demilked.com/american-myths-debunked/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T13:06:47Z
Full Content:
No matter where you are in the world, you probably know a lot about what happens in America. Hollywood culture—and now American influencers—have made sure the rest of the world is familiar with life in the 50 states. Maybe you’ve seen TV shows that gave you an idea of American high school life, or footage of US portion sizes that made you wonder: are these depictions accurate, or just exaggerated myths? A curious Redditor’s online post sparked an interesting discussion, asking, “Non-Americans, what is something about the US that you’ve always wondered if it was real or just myth/hyperbole?” People worldwide responded with their questions, and Americans chimed in with their answers. We’ve collected some of the top favourites and shared them in the gallery below. Image source: RememberValentine, Jack Is it really a common thing that the police busts partys of high-schoolers? Do young people get arrested then because of underage drinking? ugh_this_world_sucks: I have ran and hid from the cops many times as a teenager. Almost always exclusively at parties Image source: lunchbockslarry, fajri nugroho I’ve always wondered if people really do have endless refills at restaurants or if it’s just a thing in movies. DonovanSarovir: Yeah that’s real, but generally only applies to fountain drinks like soda and cheap lemonade (NOT SPRITE), as well as black coffee. You’ll pay once and they keep you topped up, or sometimes you can refill it yourself. Expensive drinks like cocktails and stuff are one-offs like other places though. Soda is just so cheap because of corn subsidies that each glass costs them like five to ten cents. For those that are against universal healthcare because they don’t want to be paying for other people’s treatment, do they really not understand how medical insurance works ? AllRhythmNoBlues: Yes. They really do not understand. At all. ETA: I should clarify that the health care system in the U.S. is purposely convoluted. There are a multitude of reasons for this thought process. Some, for example, may think everyone should simply be responsible for themselves, even though that is impossible in a functioning society. Mostly, it’s corporate greed driven. Aside from the money structure which has been discussed in another answer, health insurance is tied to employment. It’s seen as something to be earned or deserved for working. If you don’t work, you supposedly don’t deserve to be healthy? Very broadly speaking, the American perspective is that things should be earned and for some reason, your health is included in that. It’s depressing on a whole new level because it’s self-inflicted. Image source: Frothingdogscock Image source: WhoregasmPerfection, RDNE Stock project Is it actually true you’re scared to call the ambulance or go to the hospital? Lily_Lupin: Called the ambulance in college once. Got a bill equal to several months’ rent afterwards. Haven’t called one since – uber or friends it is. Do your police systems/databases not talk to each other? Like you always hear “they crossed state lines we lost them” whereas in australia everyone is in the one database. You do something in one state? You’ll show up in the next. protomanEXE1995: We are remarkably divided among states and localities. The cultural demand for various levels of local sovereignty means that centralized control is heavily discouraged and rather uncommon. Image source: millycactus Are house numbers really as big as they are in movies. Every house is like 51234 something or other street. It’s a rare road here in Oz that cracks more than 200. Flame_MadeByHumans: The beginning number of a house in the US usually relates to the cross street. So all the houses between 42nd and 43rd street will be 4210, 4220, etc. It’s typically a codified system instead of houses 1-20 specific to a single street. Image source: cackmobile Do you just hang up the phone without saying goodbye, like in tv shows and the movies? keirmeister: No. That’s weird to us as well. I’m not sure where that concept in movies came from. Image source: nerdy_vanilla Is it true that prices of goods in shops is displayed without the tax and you have to work that bit out yourself? Surely not. ItsNotKenough: The sales tax also varies from state to state and can even vary from counties and cities within each individual state. Typically people don’t take the time to calculate the sales tax and just know it’ll be more than the price tag. Image source: walktheground Is it true that millions of sedentary obese American citizens drive huge pickup trucks and hate cyclists & vegans? AllieLoft: If the other comments haven’t answered your question- yes. All of those things: pickups, cycling, veganism, are tied to identity and politics at least loosely in this insane current political climate we have. At this point, a lot of us are programmed to make assumptions about people based on their car, eating habits, etc. Basically, we’re drowning in propaganda over here. Image source: summitcreature Image source: Marco-YES, Meruyert Gonullu Do you really throw garbage down the sink? Doesn’t it get clogged? Kent_Knifen: Some sinks are equipped with a garbage disposal. Think of it like a blender hidden just past the drain. It will chop up food particles small enough where they can go down the plumbing. You would NOT use this for all garbage, just discarded food. Image source: pseudo__gamer, Mathias Reding Are there really beer kegs in big parties? Where do you even buy kegs? GeorgeCabana: Yes. Many liquor stores offer kegs (you have to return the empty keg and taps). Image source: TheLesserWeeviI, Wynand van Poortvliet Do schools really have their own police/security? CuriousCuriousAlice: Yes, the bigger ones. In my city you will see them in their own police cars that say ‘[school name] campus police’ on the side. Honestly, most of their time is spent dealing with traffic before and after school. Image source: LenoreEvermore, Getty Images Do people really drive drunk as casually as they do in tv and movies? It seems like in tv shows even cops just get behind the wheel after slamming a few whiskeys, and regular people drive black out drunk. peternormal: Absolutely. It is not as common as it used to be, but like, for example… When I was a kid in the 80s it was legal to drink a beer while driving in Texas. Image source: No_Step9082, Carol Highsmith’s America Does your front door actually lead directly to the living room? that’s so wild to me. Like if I’m lounging on the sofa and my room mate comes home with maybe even another guest in tow, they’d be entering right into the living room and the door is opened to the outside? Ironhold: Depends on region, age of house, design of house, and lots of other things. Most of my apartments had some kind of entryway, at least. A few of my friends’ houses front door was straight to the living room/front room and the back door was straight to the kitchen. Image source: MisterBerry94, Gerald Schömbs Shark Week. Is it really just about sharks? vixiecat: Sure is! It’s great! All day and night, nothing on that channel but programs about sharks. Do school kids really sell wrapping paper and cookies to make money? budgie02: Sometimes, school fundraisers are common. At least when I was in school we got a magazine of home items like candles, blankets and such and would have to canvas the neighborhood and our family to sell it. The kid who sold the most would win an Xbox, or something like that. Image source: Thatkoshergirl Can you really pull yourself up by your bootstraps all on your own and achieve the American dream? Amenmeit: Unless you get extremely lucky or severely neglect your health, not anymore. Round about the mid to late nineties that fizzled out. Image source: KratosLegacy Image source: dexvoltage, Gustavo Fring That you have to “earn” your sick days at work. ATLDeepCreeker: Not earn, “accrue”. When you start a job that pays by the hour, you accrue a certain percentage of PAID sick time per week. The same holds true for vacation time. You can also take unpaid sick time. Some companies are flexible also, allowing you to use un-accrued sick time, before you actually earn it. If you are on salary, its a bit different. All of my sick and vacation time is available to me on January 1st. Haven’t really thought about it “always”, but become wondering some time ago if americans really can’t go anywhere without car. Do they really can’t come outside their homes and go by legs with friends to nearest park or some shopping mall to just chill there? Are they really imprisoned in their suburbs untill some parent drive them on their hammer 100 km to the nearest “fun place” or untill the same parents buy them a car? LakeExtreme7444: The more rural you are, the more dependent on a car you’ll be. Where I live, the closest gas station and grocery store are about 10-15 minutes away and I live 30 minutes from my work (this is all by car). We don’t have public transportation where I live, so if I didn’t have a car, I wouldn’t be able to work or buy things without a full day’s walk, at the very least. Timtronic125: My local park is about 1.4 miles away. That’s 4 minutes by car, 35 minutes to walk. I work in the next city over. 26 miles by interstate @ approximately 40 minutes commute time. Walking to work would take 9 hours. America is huge and really spread out. And I live in the suburbs. Couldn’t imagine living in the Midwest. Image source: InteractionGreedy159 Image source: SomePeopleCall, Mary Taylor One of our exchange students was floored when she found out that the yellow school buses are real. From watching (admittedly too much) reality shows – how common is lip-fillers/Botox in people in their 20s/30s? FluffyOwl30: In every day people? Probably not high. In people who make money off their appearance? Probably high. Image source: Iluvaic How you guys are able to punch a hole through a wall. Where I’m from, all our homes are brick and concrete so if you punched a wall you’d be pretty screwed for life. arrius01: Most residential walls in the US are sheetrock which is fairly easy to punch through between the studs which are generally 16 in apart. Before sheetrock, many walls were strips of wood covered in plaster. I think hitting one of those would not have gone well for the person. There are lots of homes here with brick as well, but that is not as common, particularly portions of the country that aren’t constructed pre-turn of the century Image source: Beneficial_Pay5720 How common are basements and attics in houses? Is it exclusive for middle and upper middle class and above or most houses have them? atomiku121: Depends on the area you’re in. In my area (Midwest) both are quite common for a couple reasons. Attics are common because we can get a LOT of snow, so sloped roofs are needed to handle the load. Depending on the slope, the space may not be usable for much outside of storage, hence the attic. My home has an attic that was large enough to convert into a large master bedroom. Basements are common here because the soil has a lot of clay and is generally soft enough to dig through without too much issue, and having a portion of your home below grade is very nice to have in the event a tornado comes through. Image source: WnDelPiano In The Sopranos, Tony quotes another character saying “Nowhere else in the world [do] people expect to be happy except here in this country and still we’re not.” Do most Americans actually have that expectation? jimb575: As an American, I can unequivocally say that this is 100% true. I never understood this drive that people have here that they need to be happy. Not content, but happy. We’re taught that if you’re not happy then there is something wrong. In my view, this causes all types of issues – hyper-materialism, self doubt, false competition, etc… And the worst part is that the people that expect to be happy usually expect someone else to make them happy… Image source: johnnyknack Is it true Americans have no job security and your boss can just fire you for no reason, like Trump in the Apprentice? tstackspaper: Yes this is true. It’s called “at-will employment” It is illegal for an employer to terminate an employee for reasons that violate federal or state laws, however you’d be burdened proving this in a court of law so typically people just move on instead of wasting time trying to sue over it.
