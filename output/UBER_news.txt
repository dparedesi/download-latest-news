For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recently spoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last year expressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEO John Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO, Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president, Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president, Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are "enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Witz and her husband left lunch with a copy of Barry Diller's book, "Who Knew." Lütke and his wife, Fiona McKean, wore denim as they walked to a morning session at the conference. McKean wore a top from Finnish design house Marimekko. Kent layered a colorful outfit while his wife, Monica Meacci, stuck with an all-white look. Hastings was seen talking with Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, pictured at left here. Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, was also in attendance at the conference. Silver was seen carrying notes and a laptop as he walked around the conference grounds. Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took a phone call between sessions. Duolingo cofounder Luis von Ahn sported a casual look at the conference. Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp., the media conglomerate founded by Rupert Murdoch, wore jeans and plaid over a graphic tee. He accessorized with bracelets and a black News Corp hat. Jump to
