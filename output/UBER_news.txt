October 30, 2025 13:30 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino THIRD-QUARTER 2025 Continuation of the first half-year's growth dynamic Growth in net sales: +0.5% LFL in Q3 and +0.6% over the first nine months The initial results of the “Renouveau” plan are confirmed, and the Group is again reporting like-for-like net sales growth this quarter. Increase in cumulative adjusted EBITDA1 at end-September: +13% Cost cutting and the bulk of the work already carried out on streamlining the store network enabled the Group to increase its adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of the year: Compliance with the covenant and slight upturn in cash flow Improved free cash flow before financial expenses: -€39m at end-September 2025 (-€48m at end-June), underpinned by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. The Group reiterates that the basis of comparison was adversely affected by the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash flow amounted to -€198 million. The Group's liquidity1 stood at €1.22bn at 30 September 2025. Covenant requirements were satisfied, with a “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio of 7.68x at end-September 2025, below the threshold of 8.34x. The Group is maintaining its objective of returning to break-even free cash flow before financial expenses in 2026 and confirms the financial objectives set out in its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan. SALES AND ADJUSTED EBITDA In Q3 2025, net sales amounted to €2,002m, up +0.5% on a like-for-like basis, with convenience brands up +1.1% in Q3. After taking into account a -0.2-pt calendar effect and the roughly -3.5 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, Q3 sales were down -3.2%. Over the first nine months of 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €6,080m, up +0.6% like-for-like, with convenience brands up +1.1%. After considering a -0.6-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the roughly -2.9 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, total sales for the first nine months were down -2.9%. Group adjusted EBITDA stood at €456m (+13%) over the first nine months of 2025, lifting the margin to 7.5% (+106 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €112m (vs. €59m over the first nine months of 2024). Monoprix Growth was driven by food sales (+0.9%), once again underpinned by a good performance in fresh products (+2.1%), particularly fruit and vegetables, which continued to benefit from marketing initiatives including the price repositioning initiated in H1 2025. Non-food sales were stable this quarter, as the Fashion & Home segment continued to outperform the market. Monoprix also continued to develop its "La Cantine" food concept, launched in April, with the roll-out of 3 additional stores in Paris and the Paris region, bringing the number of stores converted to the new concept by end-September to 6, with the aim of extending the concept to around 10 stores by the end of the year. Over the quarter, the streamlining of the store network resulted in the closure of 3 stores and the transfer of 3 owned stores to franchises at Monoprix (16 closures and 3 transfers since the beginning of the year). The brand also opened 8 new outlets during the quarter (19 since the beginning of the year). Franprix The positive impact of the "prix francs” (fair prices) campaign, with price cuts and price freezes on 50 private-label products, and the good performance of stores converted to the "Oxygène" concept, helped to support this trend over the quarter. The concept was extended to a further 25 stores over the quarter, bringing the total number of stores converted to the new concept to 75 at end-September, outperforming the rest of the store network (like-for-like sales growth of +2.3% over the quarter vs. -0.2% for the store network as a whole). Franprix continued to expand its quick meal solutions offer at end-September with the roll-out of two low-cost meal deals (breakfast and lunch).Changes within the Franprix network continued during the quarter with 24 store closures, 5 openings (64 closures, 22 openings and 6 transfers of owned stores to franchises or business leases since the beginning of the year). Casino/Spar/Vival This performance was underpinned by strong momentum in July (+3.6%) and September (+2.0%), ahead of a +0.3% improvement in August. Seasonal stores once again supported the trend this quarter, with a good summer season in the mountains for the Spar and Sherpa stores. Over the quarter, the Casino, Spar and Vival owned stores recorded a -1.2% decline in customer traffic (compared with a -0.2% decline in Q2 and a -2.9% decline in Q1).The roll-out of the "Coeur de Blé" quick meal solutions concept continued with 22 new dedicated outlets opened this quarter (36 at end-September) and 26 more planned by the end of the year. The new Spar "Origines" concept, which saw its first store opening in Luynes (Bouches-du-Rhône) this summer, confirmed the net sales growth prospects. The brand plans to open 4 more new stores by the end of the year, and to accelerate roll-out in 2026.The store network saw 98 stores leave the network in Q3 2025, 37 store openings and 19 transfers from owned stores to franchises (866 exits, 101 openings and 67 transfers to franchises since the beginning of the year). Naturalia This performance was boosted by a good momentum in the organic market, amplified by the effectiveness of in-store initiatives and the ongoing success of the "La Ferme" concept, rolled out in 3 additional stores this quarter (23 stores rolled out at end-September). The momentum of e-commerce sales continued, with +27% growth for the brand’s website, while Naturalia continues to expand its quick commerce business with the expansion of its Uber Eats partnership to 9 new stores over the quarter (47 stores at end-September). The quick meal solutions offer further expanded its roll-out: 3 new stores switched to the organic snacking concept this quarter, bringing the number of stores in the test phase to 9. Naturalia closed 1 store and opened 1 store in Q3 2025 (12 closures, 1 opening and 1 transfer from an owned store to a business lease since the beginning of the year). Cdiscount Driven by the marketing reinvestment plan, brand awareness rose significantly and new customer acquisition accelerated (+41% in Q3 2025 after +37% in H1). Cdiscount net sales fell by -2.9% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting the priority given to profitability through the momentum of the Marketplace and the moderate decline in direct sales. Cdiscount Advertising's momentum (revenues up +7.8%) continued with the launch of a new Retail Media product, “Sponsored Brand Video”. Other and Quatrim OTHER FINANCIAL INDICATORS Free cash flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations Over the first nine months of 2025, free cash flow before financial expenses stood at -€39m (-€48m at end-June), driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. It therefore improved by +€500m compared with the first nine months of 2024 (-€539m) and by +€347m excluding the repayment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. Liquidity7 at 30 September 2025 At 30 September 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.22bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Covenants Net leverage ratio7 The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio stood at 7.68x, below the ratio requirement of 8.34x. The Group states that the EBITDA forecasts for Q4 2025 should ensure compliance with the next test, which will take place on 31 December 2025. HIGHLIGHTS Real estate disposals Quatrim and its subsidiaries disposed of €14m in real estate assets in Q3 2025. On 1 August, the Group repaid €20m of the secured debt carried by Quatrim, enabling reduction of the nominal value of this debt to €198m at 30 September 2025. Assaí procedure Since the press release dated 26 September 2025 concerning the request for provisional measures submitted by Sendas Distribuidora S.A. (see press release), Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Segisor (collectively "Casino") have had access to the file and Casino has presented its defence to the judge. The proceedings are in progress. Proceedings before the Paris Court Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was referred to the Paris Criminal Court following the preliminary investigation by the Financial Public Prosecutor (Parquet National Financier – PNF) for alleged stock price manipulation and private corruption dating back to 2018 and 2019. The hearing before the Paris Criminal Court took place from 1 to 22 October 2025. The Financial Public Prosecutor requested (i) that Casino Guichard Perrachon be ordered to pay a fine of €75m and (ii) that it be prohibited from making an offer to the public of securities and from having its securities admitted to trading on a regulated market for a period of three years, suspended in its entirety, and that it be subject to a compliance programme supervised by the French Anti-Corruption Agency (Agence Française Anticorruption – AFA). These requisitions do not constitute a court decision and the Financial Public Prosecutor's requests are not binding on the Court. Casino Guichard Perrachon contests the fact that it can be personally accused of an offence and asserts that it did not, in any way, benefit from the alleged events mentioned in this dispute. The Group points out that no provision has been recorded in its financial statements in this respect. Judgement is expected to be handed down on 29 January 2026. Franchising of 27 Monop’ stores The Group announces the franchising of 27 Monop’ stores in Paris and the Île-de-France region as part of the joint venture between Monoprix and the Zouari family (7 stores on 28 October, 11 on 29 October and 9 on 30 October).

The figure is calculated at constant exchange rates, excluding calendar effects and tax. Gross merchandise volume (GMV)For convenience brands, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by all the owned and franchised stores and the e-commerce sites, including VAT. For Cdiscount, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by the Cdiscount group’s websites and by independent Marketplace vendors.

Title: OpenAI Reportedly Planning ‘Up to $1 Trillion’ IPO as Early as Next Year

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes An anonymously sourced report from Reuters claims that OpenAI is planning an initial public offering that would value the AI colossus at “up to $1 trillion.” Just on Tuesday the company formally completed its slow evolution from an ambiguous non-profit to a for-profit company. Now it appears to be formalizing plans to become one of the world’s centers of economic powerâat least on paper.Â Â The $1 trillion report comes from “three people familiar with the matter.” Reuters’ sources claimed that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has been telling OpenAI “associates” that an IPO is coming in 2027, but that actually it could come in late 2026.Â Judging by the current ranking of companies by market capitalization, a $1 trillion valuation would make OpenAI the 12th most valuable publicly traded firm on Earth, just below Berkshire Hathaway, and just above JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.Â A publicly traded OpenAI would make for a fascinating case study, since shareholders really do expect companies to bring in money instead of just spending itâsomething OpenAI has notoriously had a hard time doing so far. As Elon Musk once put it, “There’s immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter.”Â Becoming public can force a lot of information about a company’s real value into public viewâquarterly and annual reports on finances most famously, but also everything about the company’s history that goes in an IPO prospectus. Institutional investors buy shares based on that prospectus, and when the company does go public, its merits can be judged harshly by Wall Street traders, as happened with Uber when it went public in 2019, and its stock price immediately plunged. Companies can also sense which way the wind is blowing if things aren’t going well, and withdraw an IPO before the company gets humiliated, as happened with Ari Emmanuel’s talent agency Endeavor Group in the same year as Uber’s humiliating debut. In a livestream on Tuesday, Sam Altman made similarly grandiose claims about 13-figure sums of money. According to Axios, he said eventually he’d like to build one gigawatt’s worth of new data center capacity per week, which he expects to cost 20 billion per gigawatt. Add it up yourself, and that’s over $1 trillion per year. “Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we’re on a pretty steep curve towards that,” he claimed. He also added (again, per Axios) that going public “is the most likely path for us given the capital needs that we’ll have and, sort of, the size of the company.”Â Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. The de Blasio "impersonator" was profiled in 2020. But he didn't have AI back then. On an earnings call, Zuck acknowledged that Metaâs massive AI spend might not go as intended in the near future. The rise of artificial intelligence is driving a surge of data center construction across the United States, and rural communities are feeling the impact. The old OpenAI is dead. Now to Figure Out the Profit Part. The company's position seems to be that's not that bad. Don't sext Clippy. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

The most expensive company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The market capitalization of Nvidia passed the $5 trillion mark on Wednesday, following a host of potentially lucrative deals and projects the company announced at its GPU Technology Conference event on Tuesday. The company's stock price continues to be driven by the broad interest towards artificial intelligence and Nvidia's unique position in the AI supply chain that now spans from humble chips for inference to gigawatt-scale data centers for massive AI training. At its GTC 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., Nvidia made a number of announcements that could potentially bring tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in revenue to the company in the coming years. Among the highlights announced by Nvidia are reference designs for gargantuan gigawatt-scale AI data centers that will let newcomers to build new AI factories using Nvidia blueprints and hardware; partnership with Palantir to build an integrated stack for operational AI; the deal with Uber to use Nvidia's Level 4 AGX Drive Hyperion platform for its fleet of autonomous robotaxis as well as adoption of the same platform by Mercedes, Stellantis, Volvo, Lucid, and Foxconn; NVQLink technology to attach Nvidia GPUs to quantum computers; partnership to build AI-RAN products with Nokia; contracts to build seven AI supercomputers for the U.S. government; and plans to build AI-native 6G networks in the U.S. together with partners. The new announcements place Nvidia at the center of the large-scale AI supply chain, which will drive demand for the company's hardware and software solutions. Nvidia's AI platform comprises numerous products, including GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, NVLink switches, and Ethernet and Infiniband solutions. If one wants to build an Nvidia-based cluster or data center for AI, they will inevitably procure plenty of Nvidia-designed hardware and software to build it and operate it. While for now Nvidia supplies AI hardware to companies like AWS, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI, in the coming years, it is going to expand its total addressable market to both established players across industries (e.g., Lilly is already building its own AI data center) and new players that have yet to become significant in their realms. Even established companies are increasing their demands for AI GPUs. For example, Nvidia supplied about four million Hopper-based AI GPUs throughout the architecture's active lifetime, and shipments of Blackwell stand at six million units now and yet have to peak. With new participants entering the AI field, sales of Nvidia's hardware are poised to skyrocket. Nvidia's unique position in the growing AI supply chain places it well above other semiconductor and high-tech companies as far as market capitalization is concerned. The company at press time cost over a trillion dollars more than Apple ($4.011 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.995 trillion), nearly two trillion dollars more than Alphabet ($3.257 trillion), and two times more than Amazon ($2.444 billion). Interestingly, TSMC — the key supplier to Nvidia that produces all of its silicon — now has a market capitalization of $1.582 trillion, whereas ASML — the key supplier to TSMC — now costs $416.5 billion. Market capitalization of Nvidia's traditional rivals — AMD and Intel — stands at $429 billion and $197 billion, respectively.

Nvidia has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was first to break through the $4 trillion barrier. Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that’s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. But there are concerns of a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday the shares touched $207.86 in early morning trading with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.05 trillion. In comparison, Nvidia’s value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Demand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting, saying that the generative AI chatbots that were merely “interesting” when they first took hold a few years ago are now becoming so useful that they will be profitable. Huang was heading to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, are gathering for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping U.S. tariffs on technology and other products. The multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event — a face-to-face meeting on Thursday between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act. On Tuesday, Huang disclosed $500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers. Last month Nvidia announced that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. In August, Huang said that Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he will speak with Xi about Nvidia’s chips on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Title: The world's 10 richest people are $500 billion wealthier this year, thanks to the AI boom

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to
