Investing Lyft has gained over 50% in the past two years while pursuing robotaxi partnerships targeting high-traffic areas like airports. Build-a-Bear Workshop surged 226% over two years and trades at 16.2x P/E while expanding internationally. Mid-cap stocks may benefit from falling interest rates and potential M&A activity as the rally broadens beyond mega-cap tech. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lyft (CC by 2.0) by stockcatalog The mid-cap stocks might finally be worth a second look now that interest rates are coming down. With more cuts expected in the new year and a potential wave of M&A activity that could see industry heavyweights scoop up the small- and mid-cap firms, perhaps considering a firm with a sub-$10 billion market cap could make sense with your next purchase. As always, the mid-cap stocks can be a choppier ride, but with greater volatility and risk could accompany a shot at decent rewards. In any case, let’s check in on two cheap-looking mid-cap names that I think are worth watching closely in an environment that might finally jolt the smaller firms that stand to benefit most as the stock market rally broadens beyond mega-cap tech. Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is far more than just an app to check if you’re not happy with the ride prices over on Uber (NYSE:UBER). The $7.7 billion ride-hailing firm has been gaining ground in the past two years, rising by over 50%, as the firm held its ground against a tough rival in Uber. While there are still many, many miles of ground to make up if Lyft is to catch up to the likes of Uber, I do find the rise of autonomous vehicles to be an intriguing wild card that might actually work out in Lyft’s favor. Of course, Uber also has its own self-driving vehicle ambitions, but with Lyft going about robotaxis from a different angle, I do think that there’s potential to thrive in a specific corner of the robotaxi market. Notably, Lyft’s autonomous shuttle partnership could pay big dividends as the firm targets high-traffic areas like airports. Such a service is sure to be welcomed news by frequent flyers. Add regional robotaxi partnerships (think Waymo and lesser-known autonomous driving startups) into the equation, and Lyft seems to have a pretty solid growth runway as robotaxis continue to roll out. With Lyft also looking to hit the gas with its global expansion (especially in Europe), Lyft has a high growth ceiling, and if it can execute, I do think going with the ride-hailing underdog might prove more lucrative. Build-a-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW) might be a sub-$1 billion company, but the past two years’ worth of gains (up 226%) have put the name on the map of many retail investors, including those who aren’t interested in trading meme stocks. Though shares of the mall-based plushie retailer might have meme potential, I think the stock is an even better long-term hold, given its modest valuation multiple (shares go for 16.2 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) at the time of this writing) and improving fundamentals. As the company expands internationally while capitalizing on the “kidulting” trend with cherished, nostalgic brands (like Pokémon), it’s no mystery as to why Build-a-Bear might be the perfect growth stock to play the strengthening of the middle-income consumer in 2026. Indeed, it seems like the Build-a-Bear Workshops at the mall always seem to be packed these days. While tariffs and consumer spending shifts could make for a bumpy ride over the long haul, I do see ample room to run, especially given the mere $926 million market cap. Add lower rates into the equation, which tends to be a boon for smaller retailers, and Build-a-Bear Workshop stands out as one of the more compelling smaller-cap firms to follow closely. Who knows? Perhaps a toy giant might view the firm as a compelling takeover candidate, given its pristine balance sheet and impressive brand power. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Did Nvidia Just Unleash a Tesla-Killer?

Investing Tesla (TSLA) delivered 1.6M vehicles in 2025, down 8.6% year-over-year. This marks the steepest annual drop in company history. Nvidia‘s open-source Alpamayo platform could enable any automaker to deploy autonomous vehicles. Tesla faces intensified competition as rivals adopt the technology. Tesla will stop selling Full Self-Driving as an $8K one-time purchase after Feb. 14. The company will instead offer only a $99 monthly subscription. Sending You to Google News in 3 © metamorworks / Getty Images Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock surged to a new all-time high of $498.83 in December, driven by optimism around its artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and energy initiatives. However, shares have since pulled back 11%% amid broader market concerns. While these ancillary businesses contributed to the stock’s rally, Tesla remains primarily an electric vehicle (EV) company, even as global deliveries declined 8.6% in 2025 to 1.6 million units — the steepest annual drop in its history and the second consecutive year of falling sales. Deliveries were down sharply in key markets like Europe (down almost 28%) and China (hitting a three-year low in October). Now, Tesla faces intensified pressure on the automotive front following Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CES 2026 reveal earlier this month of advanced technology that could challenge its dominance in autonomous driving. Nvidia has been a key player in the automotive sector since 2015 with its DRIVE platform, a scalable architecture for autonomous vehicles. DRIVE integrates high-performance computing, sensors, and software to enable advanced driver assistance and full autonomy. By 2026, the ecosystem includes partnerships with automakers like Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, using DRIVE Hyperion for Level 4-ready systems. The platform processes data from cameras, radars, and LiDAR, supporting simulation for safe testing. This long-term involvement has positioned Nvidia as a supplier-agnostic enabler, contrasting with Tesla’s vertically integrated approach. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled the Alpamayo family, an open-source portfolio of AI models, simulation tools, and datasets aimed at accelerating safe, reasoning-based autonomous vehicle development. Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter vision-language-action model, introduces chain-of-thought reasoning to handle complex, rare scenarios like unpredictable pedestrians or adverse weather. Paired with AlpaSim for high-fidelity testing and 1,700 hours of curated driving data, it emphasizes explainability and safety. Mercedes-Benz plans to integrate it into vehicles like the CLA, with U.S. deployments starting this year. Alpamayo could also revolutionize self-driving by enabling any automaker to become an AV producer through open models that integrate with existing fleets. Developers can fine-tune on proprietary data and validate in simulation before deployment. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), for example, has partnered on Alpamayo and DRIVE AGX Hyperion 10 for Level 4 autonomy, aiming to scale to 100,000 vehicles by 2027 with Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) initially supplying the cars. Others, including Bosch and Magna, are expanding adoption, potentially flooding the market with competitive AV options. Tesla, which is counting on its Cybercab to help revive its fortunes when it begins its production in Q2, trails Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo in autonomy, with Waymo logging over 100 million driverless miles and 450,000 weekly paid rides across five U.S. cities. Tesla’s 7 billion miles are supervised, requiring human intervention. As more manufacturers adopt Alpamayo, Tesla could face more competition, eroding its EV sales further amid already declining deliveries. Is Tesla panicking yet? Elon Musk announced on X that Tesla will stop selling Full Self-Driving (FSD) as a one-time $8,000 purchase after Feb. 14, offering it only as a $99 monthly subscription. This aims to boost adoption (currently at 12% of owners) and generate recurring revenue amid slumping sales. It may also hedge legal risks tied to unfulfilled autonomy promises. With more AV choices emerging, Tesla’s sales decline could worsen. Nvidia’s Alpamayo isn’t an immediate Tesla-killer but could erode its edge by democratizing AV tech for rivals, pressuring Tesla’s core EV business amid an ongoing decline in EV demand. Still, Tesla’s long-term outlook as the U.S. EV leader remains strong, with analysts forecasting 12% delivery growth to 1.83 million in 2026, aided by a refresh of its Model Y. Ancillary segments like energy storage (up significantly) and robotics could offset car woes, but success hinges on ramping up its robotaxi ambitions. Investors shouldn’t be too concerned yet about this threat, though it is real. And if it hits its autonomy milestones, Tesla stock could be considered a buy at this price point. Although Tesla stock still trades at a premium, caution is warranted so I wouldn’t be picking up large tranches of shares just yet until it shows clear progress is being made.

Investing Stocks were walloped on Tuesday after JPMorgan missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The good news on Tuesday was the December consumer price index report that showed inflation hitting the 2.7% target, while core inflation came in below estimates at 2.6% Investors will be watching the other big banks that will report this week after the somewhat worrisome JPMorgan print. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower after the January rally hit a wall on Wednesday, with all major indices falling, and the selling looks set to continue today. The main culprit yesterday was JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) shares, which took a hit after missing analyst estimates for the quarter. The banking giant posted $4.63 per share, below the expected $4.86, primarily due to a surprise decline in investment banking fees and costs associated with the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue slightly beat expectations, and trading and net interest income showed strength, making it a mixed report. That noted, the bank was priced to perfection, so the sellers traded on the print, especially after Jamie Dimon warned of risks. The Dow Jones Industrials took the biggest shot Tuesday, closing down 0.88% at 49,191, led by JPMorgan’s decline. The S&P 500 closed 0.19% lower at 6,963, while the Nasdaq finished 0.10% lower at 23,709. The Russell 2000, which has been on a roll in 2026, closed at 2,632, down 0.11%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday, with buyers leaning to the middle and longer maturities, while there was some selling in the short-term T-bills. The positive news on inflation overshadowed the feud between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as the Justice Department’s subpoenas. The 30-year-long bond finished trading on Tuesday at 4.83%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.18% Energy stocks were the big winners as prices were higher across the energy complex on Tuesday. Prices for the major benchmarks rose primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, with concerns about potential supply disruptions outweighing increased supply prospects from Venezuela following President Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran, which could start impacting global supply routes. Brent Crude finished the session at $65.38, up 2.36%, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $61.02, up 2.55%. Natural gas ended the day flat at $3.42. After a solid rally to start the day and new record highs, Gold reversed midday and ended the day 0.25% lower at $4,586. The likely reason for the slight pullback was profit-taking. Still, sales were limited by ongoing geopolitical tensions with Iran and by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s new investigation into the Fed. The weaker-than-expected US inflation report also supported expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which typically benefit gold and will likely do so going forward. Silver continued to march higher, finishing the day at $86.80, up 1.95%. The cryptocurrency market saw broad gains, with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising, supported by positive regulatory news and resumed institutional inflows, as the overall crypto market capitalization rose back over $3.2 trillion. Senator Tim Scott released a draft of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which aims to provide more explicit rules for digital assets, and that was perceived positively by traders. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $94,990, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,293. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Oswal Pumps Ltd has received an order from Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) under the PM-KUSUM B Scheme for the supply and installation of 3,263 off-grid DC solar photovoltaic water pumping systems with a total order value of ₹119.92 crore (inclusive of GST). The firm will supply and instal 3,263 off-grid DC solar photovoltaic water pumping systems under the PM-KUSUM B Scheme India’s fiscal policy set to stop being contractionary… The Ministry of Finance is set to unveil its budget for FY2026-27 on 1 February 2026, and this budget comes in the light of the Finance Ministry being reasonably well placed to hit its fiscal deficit target of 4.4% of GDP, despite a low nominal GDP growth and deep tax cuts, both for personal income tax and goods & services tax. The expenditure side, too, saw a strong come back, with capex spending rising rapidly in terms of execution, and lower energy prices giving space for containing subsidies. For FY27, we see the government broadly maintaining the current deficit, modestly reducing it to 4.3% of GDP for FY27, while capex spending targets should broadly move in sync with nominal GDP growth, which bounces back to 10.1% yoy in FY27 in our view. …and move to a debt targeting framework The Ministry of Finance is on track to hit its medium-term fiscal target of below 4.5% of GDP it had set in 2021 for the fiscal deficit and is going to pivot to a debt sustainability framework from FY27, targeting 55% of central debt to GDP, down from an estimated 56.1% of debt in FY26. This would make the fiscal position less contractionary, but maintain fiscal sustainability, ensuring spending rises broadly in sync with the nominal growth cycle, and not a drag on economic activity. Revenue projections to undershoot in FY26 From a revenue perspective, the dual tax cuts from income tax and GST will add some stress (2% lower than BE in our view), but the surge in non-tax revenues, both dividends from RBI and other public sector enterprises will make up for some of the shortfall. While the GST compensation cess has been phased put as per the recent reforms, we expect savings of Rs 350bn for FY26 basis the repayment schedule of the back-to-back loans. Still, we see scope for revenue growth to rise by 10.7% yoy, aided by reasonable growth in direct taxes, mild recovery in GST and higher provisions for dividends (RBI dividend to be ~INR 2.9trn as per our est.) and divestment inflows. With this, we see the overall revenue to GDP ratio rising to 9.6%, modestly up from 9.5% in FY26. The new revenue assumptions also will have the 16th Finance Commission recommendations incorporated, which we see largely remaining unchanged in terms of devolution. Spending mix to see defence, capex prioritized Unlike FY25, FY26 has seen a major surge in capex spending in H1FY26, but trends are expected to normalise in H2FY26. We expect some overshoot of the capex spending in FY26 (additional defence spending, +2% vs BE). We see capex allocations growing to INR12.5trn (3.2% of GDP) in FY27, and with energy prices coming off, the subsidy bills are likely to move sideways in FY27, at best. Further within capex government’s focus could remain intact in a few strategic areas: Defence, Railways & Shipbuilding while roads, rails and housing could remain subdued in FY27. We do not see the government budgeting for the eight-pay commission in FY27, which we believe will come into effect in installments in FY28-FY29, which over a year will cost the government around INR 2.4-2.8trn (0.54% - 0.65% of GDP) but split between FY28 and FY29. Further the changes proposed in VB-G RAM G may also implies some savings for the Centre. “As India approaches the Education Budget 2026, Artificial Intelligence must move from the margins to the core of education policy and funding. Though access and digital adoption have increased, the next wave of reform must be AI-enabled learning outcomes, faculty upskilling, and curriculum modernisation. Strategic budgetary support is required to integrate AI across disciplines, not as a mere technical subject, but as a managerial, ethical, and decision-making tool that future leaders need to master. More significantly, investments in AI-driven research, simulation-based learning, and industry-academia collaboration will massively increase employability and innovation capacity. The other important aspect is funding in teacher training, data infrastructure, and responsible AI frameworks to ensure inclusive and ethical adoption. A forward-looking budget embedding AI into the education ecosystem will be critical in building globally competitive institutions and future-ready talent for India’s knowledge economy.” “The importance of MSMEs is growing at a fast pace in the economy. The industry is infact emerging as a key pillar supporting India’s manufacturing renaissance in the defence sector and beyond. In areas such as drone manufacturing and unmanned systems, targeted capex incentives, output-linked support, rationalised taxation and R&D enablement can help MSMEs scale indigenous technologies and accelerate adoption. From a policy standpoint, the upcoming Budget must focus on execution and scale by lowering entry barriers for high-tech MSMEs, speeding up procurement cycles and creating stable demand visibility in defence manufacturing. Strengthening access to financing, encouraging advanced manufacturing investments and deepening domestic value addition will help MSMEs move up the value chain and advance India’s self-reliance goals while positioning the country as a global hub for defence and drone technologies.” Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) on Wednesday announced an oil discovery in Onshore Block 1, Abu Dhabi. The discovery happened on Tuesday. IOCL and BPCL announce a significant oil discovery in Abu Dhabi's Onshore Block 1, marking a major achievement in exploration. Ola Electric on Wednesday announced the expansion of its 4680 Bharat Cell platform. As part of the initiative, businesses and start-ups can now directly purchase the 4680 Bharat Cells, or the 1.5kWh 4680 Bharat Cell battery pack for application across automotive, humanoids, drones, and portable medical equipment. Ola Electric expands its 4680 Bharat Cell platform, empowering start-ups and businesses with innovative energy storage solutions for various applications. The government’s continued focus on strengthening domestic manufacturing and improving ease of doing business has created a strong foundation for sectors such as packaging. For glass manufacturers, further rationalisation of duties and calibrated safeguard mechanisms on key raw materials like soda ash can help ensure long-term supply stability and support capacity expansion. Glass and aluminium manufacturing are energy-intensive processes, and targeted incentives for energy efficiency, cleaner fuel adoption and technology upgrades will encourage faster transition while improving cost efficiency across the sector. There is also a significant opportunity to further strengthen India’s circular economy. Glass and aluminium are infinitely recyclable, and fiscal support for organised collection, segregation and recycling infrastructure will help increase recycled content, reduce resource dependence, and enhance global competitiveness. Such measures in the upcoming Union Budget will enable packaging manufacturers to invest with confidence and reinforce India’s position as a reliable hub for sustainable glass and aluminium packaging. Sustainability/ MSMEs Neha Juneja, Founding Member IndiaP2P & EquiRize We expect the Budget to advance initiatives and incentives that improve MSME credit access and accelerate green economy investments aligned with India’s SDG priorities. MSMEs account for ~30% of GDP, ~45% of exports, and over 20 Cr. jobs, yet face a credit gap exceeding ₹20 lakh crore. Addressing this through credit impetus and compliance rationalisation can materially lift employment and export competitiveness. Increased policy support for renewables, green mobility, and clean cooking sectors, which together represent $50Bn+ in annual investment potential, will strengthen medium to long term economic and climate resilience and meet our national green targets for 2030. Insurance Ankita Srivastava, General Manager – Growth & Strategy at THIP (The Healthy Indian Project) “Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, India’s health and life insurance sector stands at a pivotal moment. While GST exemptions have improved affordability and demand, long-term growth will depend on deeper structural reforms. Enhanced tax incentives, stronger micro-insurance frameworks, simplified distribution, and robust consumer protection are critical. Recent FDI liberalisation adds momentum, but the budget’s policy direction will ultimately shape penetration, innovation, and public trust.” Lending/ Finance Neha Juneja, Founding Member, IndiaP2P & EquiRize The lending sector is seeking measures that encourage the unlocking of alternative capital sources for the sector, including from retail investors. Measures such as rationalisation of TDS on listed NCDs, increased limits for RBI-regulated P2P lending, will lead to flexibility and scale in capital sourcing for NBFCs and direct lending. Health & Pharma Sudipta Sengupta, Founder & CEO, The Healthy Indian Project (THIP) As India prepares its annual budget, my key expectation is clarity and courage in supporting preventive healthcare startups. Global AI platforms like ChatGPT Health will inevitably reshape consumer health information, but without policy support, they risk overwhelming homegrown players who understand India’s realities far better. Preventive health is not just a business opportunity; it is a national necessity. I hope the government creates incentives, grants, and regulatory safeguards that empower Indian startups to innovate responsibly, compete fairly, and build trusted health ecosystems rooted in evidence, ethics, and accessibility. Vigneshkumar Dhandapani, Associate Vice President, Avalon Consulting (Pharma) “A few critical outcomes that the Indian pharma industry expects from the 2026 Union Budget: - Increase healthcare spend to 2.5% of GPD as per NHP 2017 long-standing targets, up from 1.9% of GDP in FY25. - Correction of the inverted duty structure is critical as inputs currently have higher GST rates than the finished products. Contract manufacturers and generic MSME drug manufacturers are heavily affected. ‘GST rate rationalisation’ or mandating full ITC refund holds the key. - Bulk Drugs PLI 1.0 covered 41 APIs; however, the industry awaits clarity on the scope of Rs. 15,000 Cr. Pharma PLI. Widening the net of APIs to reduce >60% dependency on China is critical and needs to be covered. - R&D is a key success enabler for the industry. Revival of 200% weighted R&D deduction would motivate the pharma firms to invest more in cutting-edge drugs/products.” Justdial, India’s No. 1 local search engine, reported a consistent performance for the third quarter of FY26 marked by steady execution across its core business while continuing to deepen its AI-led platform capabilities. During the quarter, the company posted a revenue of ₹305.7 crores, marking a YoY increase of 6.4%, while operating EBITDA stood at ₹95.2 crores, registering a YoY growth of 10.0%. Net profit stood at ₹118.0 crores, supported by disciplined cost management and stable operating performance. User and merchant engagement on the platform remained steady, with 184.5 million unique visitors recorded during the quarter and total business listings crossing 52.8 million as of 31st December 2025, underscoring Justdial’s continued relevance as India’s go-to platform for local business discovery. Mr. Shwetank Dixit, Chief Growth Officer, Just Dial, commented: “In the quarter gone by, we continued to evolve Justdial into a more intelligent, AI and automation-led platform. A key area of progress during the quarter was our move towards agentic AI, enabling the automation of critical workflows, including AI-driven analysis of user calls to businesses to identify genuine category-level intent and automatically create qualified leads, along with AI deployment across backend operations and sales functions. Looking ahead, we plan to deploy agentic AI–powered voice and chat interfaces across sales, customer support, and data verification, while embedding AI deeply into our search experience to enable more intuitive, conversational discovery. Together, these initiatives are simplifying how businesses manage their digital presence while making local discovery faster and more intuitive for our users.” Piramal Finance Limited, a leading Retail-led diversified NBFC, has raised USD 350 million in multilateral financing from two of the world’s most respected development finance institutions (DFIs) — the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) — reaffirming strong institutional confidence in the company’s strategy, governance and responsible growth trajectory. The funding package comprises: USD 200 million from IFC, and USD 150 million from ADB, under its Sustainable Finance Framework. The facilities carry a tenor of five years and will be drawn in tranches between January and March 2026, in line with regulatory guidelines. The company is also in advanced discussions to secure an additional USD 150 million from select DFIs, taking the total multilateral fundraising pipeline up to USD 500 million. This marks Piramal Finance’s inaugural DFI borrowing, further strengthening its diversified and long-term funding profile. Sees policy continuity over big-bang moves in Union Budget 2026 Mumbai, 14th January 2026: According to smallcase managers, Indian equity markets are entering 2026 on a firmer footing after a year of consolidation, with improving valuations, realistic earnings expectations and strong domestic fundamentals shaping a more constructive outlook. The three women smallcase managers Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research, Prachi Deuskar, Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, and Sneha Jain - Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services believes that while global events could be a source of uncertainty, India’s macro fundamentals remain strong. The smallcase managers believes that the coming year is likely to reward earnings-led investing rather than momentum-driven trades. They project a strong consumption-led growth cycle in 2026, supported by moderate inflation, tax cuts, GST reductions, and interest-rate cuts that boost disposable incomes and ease borrowing conditions. Commenting on the road ahead, Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager and Founder of Wright Research, said, “CY25 was a year of digestion rather than disappointment. After the strong post-COVID rally, Indian equities spent most of the year consolidating, with returns becoming narrower and more selective. As we move into CY26 which structurally is more constructive than CY25, valuations look far more reasonable today, earnings expectations are realistic rather than euphoric, and India enters the year with macro stability. We expect returns to be earnings-led in CY26 rather than multiple-led, which favours disciplined stock selection and factor-driven strategies.” She added that mid-teens earnings growth for Nifty companies, combined with improving sector breadth, makes the medium-term risk–reward more attractive despite global uncertainties. Sneha Jain, smallcase Manager, Founder & CEO, WealthTrust Capital Services said, “After the valuation reset in 2025, large caps, traditionally the premium P/B cohort, are now trading below SMIDs on a price-to-book basis — an inversion that signals subdued expectations despite superior balance-sheet strength, cash flows and governance. This provides valuation comfort and makes large caps relatively more attractive over the next 6–8 months, though allocations should remain aligned to overall asset allocation, with large caps serving as a stability anchor rather than a tactical overweight.” Budget Expectations: Women managers expects continuity over Big-Bang Announcements The managers say that Women investors and managers are not looking for headline-grabbing announcements, but for continuity. Fiscal discipline, sustained infrastructure spending, support for manufacturing and MSMEs, and clarity on long-term capital gains taxation matter more than short-term incentives. Any measures that deepen capital markets, improve retirement savings participation, or increase financial inclusion for women would be structurally positive. They expect the upcoming Union Budget to focus on continuity and structural support rather than short-term stimuli. They say that policy stability will be more critical than headline-grabbing measures. According to Prachi Deuskar, smallcase Manager and Co-founder, Lotusdew Wealth and Investment Advisors, “We anticipate the Union Budget will reinforce policy continuity around infrastructure, formalization, and fiscal prudence, alongside measures to deepen household financial participation. We also expect some support measures for the MSMEs, such as easier access to finance, credit guarantees, and incentives to boost productivity and market access. Structural incentives for manufacturing, long-term savings products, and policies that enhance ease of investing and compliance are likely to strengthen investor confidence and broaden market participation.” She noted that measures improving ease of investing, access to credit and long-term savings participation would be particularly constructive for sustained wealth creation. Sectors to watch in CY26: Quality, Capex and Selective Growth Experts believe sector leadership in 2026 will remain selective, with quality and balance-sheet strength taking precedence over broad-based rallies. They added that that valuation dispersion across market segments is creating opportunities, particularly within large caps. Sonam Srivastava highlighted that financials, capital goods and manufacturing-linked sectors remain central to the investment narrative. She highlights that well-capitalised private banks and select NBFCs continue to benefit from steady credit growth and stable asset quality. Industrials, capital goods and defence are supported by the multi-year capex cycle. Manufacturing-linked themes such as EMS, auto ancillaries and specialty chemicals are becoming more selective but attractive at corrected valuations. Technology services could offer incremental upside as global demand stabilises. Consumption recovery is likely to be gradual rather than sharp. Sneha Jain bets more on Information Technology and Precious Metals. She notes that The earnings yield of CNX IT has inched below the US 10yr Bond yield. Markets are pricing Indian IT similar to a Bond expecting low to no growth. Any growth in Indian IT sector should lead to rerating. On other hand, the gold–silver ratio, which was the primary indicator behind our silver call, has reverted to its historical median, suggesting silver now looks fairly overvalued at current prices. At the current ratio, gold offers a higher implied 1-year forward return than silver, reflecting relatively better risk-reward at this juncture. While, Prachi Deuskar believes that Capital goods, industrial and defence sectors stand to benefit from ongoing infrastructure capex and supply-chain shifts. She notes that select consumption segments and healthcare demonstrate resilient demand, while niche IT and technology service providers with differentiated offerings could outperform as digital adoption grows. While, FMCG sector is reporting signs of demand recovery and double-digit earnings growth, underpinned by improving core consumption trends. Budget Expectations – What must not be overlooked. India today does not suffer from a lack of intent or ambition in defence manufacturing. Over the years, industry has developed meaningful capabilities, created robust infrastructure, and nurtured specialised talent aligned with clearly identified defence priorities. What now requires equal attention is the sustainability of this ecosystem as it moves from promise to performance. The cost and risk borne by industry in taking a technology beyond early production are often underestimated. From practical experience, the most fragile phase of any defence programme is the transition from initial production to scale. This is the stage at which development timelines tend to stretch, costs escalate due to refinements and testing, and programme momentum can weaken. Similarly, capital investments made by industry in defence manufacturing are inherently long term in nature and expenditure is uneven across budget cycles. Hence disrupts capacity planning, quality systems, compliances, and after-sales support though the overall budget allocation appears stable. On the exports front, there is today genuine global interest in sourcing defence systems from India. However, exporting defence equipment cannot be treated as an extension of domestic procurement. To be credible in international markets, industry must invest upfront in regulatory compliance, certifications, disciplined documentation practices, and long-term maintenance and support infrastructure. A Union Budget that recognises these realities, without micromanaging execution, can strengthen national security while creating long-term economic value. “As we look ahead to Budget 2026, retail and bond investors alike are keenly focused on fiscal consolidation and credible deficit guidance. A disciplined glide path toward narrower deficits not only helps keep government bond yields steady but also creates conditions for Indian corporates to tap the debt markets with greater confidence. Increased corporate borrowing via bonds can meaningfully boost capital formation and support broader economic growth. On the tax front, I do not expect major changes in direct or indirect taxes, other than clarifications, since both regimes have undergone significant reform over the last 12 months.” “With the Union Budget 2026-27 approaching, the rail sector is entering a phase where execution and reform will matter as much as headline allocations. The Railways Minister’s ‘52 Reforms in 52 Weeks’ programme signals a clear push toward system-wide improvements in operations, safety, and service delivery. Based on recent trends, the rail outlay is expected to see a calibrated increase of around five percent, taking the overall allocation to approximately ₹2.65 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary resources. With electrification nearing completion, capital deployment is likely to be redirected toward easing congestion through new lines, gauge conversion, track doubling, and the expansion of Dedicated Freight Corridors and economic corridors linked to ports and mineral clusters. The reform agenda’s focus on faster adoption of artificial intelligence and advanced technologies for safety, predictive maintenance, and train operations is particularly encouraging, as it reflects a shift from asset creation alone to measurable performance outcomes. From an industry standpoint, continued capital support, regulatory simplification, deeper private sector involvement, and a more enabling framework for public-private partnerships will determine how effectively policy intent translates into on-ground execution. The forthcoming Budget should therefore focus on converting reform intent into projects that directly reduce congestion and lift operating efficiency across the rail network.” Rajat Bokolia, CEO, Newstone, says, “As the Union Budget 2026 approaches on February 1st, Tier II cities like Sonipat are becoming top real estate investment spots. Tier II cities offer affordable prices compared to Tier-1 cities. Sonipat leads this trend in the NCR. Better connectivity, RRTS, Metro extensions, UER-II, and the Sonipat Master Plan 2031 attract homebuyers as well as developers. Sonipat offers affordable options compared to Gurugram or Noida, along with rising job opportunities. The key expectations from the budget are that it might raise affordable housing limits, increase home loan tax deductions, and reduce GST/Stamp duties. This would drive more growth in tier-II cities like Sonipat. Investors could see post-budget price rises making Tier-II cities a smart investment choice.” Abhay Mishra, President & CEO, Jindal Realty, says , “The upcoming Union Budget 2026 should recognise that India’s housing momentum is now led by Tier-II cities rather than just metros. With better infrastructure and stable prices, these markets can grow faster if the budget boosts urban infrastructure spending, gives tax support to homebuyers, and encourages affordable housing. Sonipat, an emerging NCR hotspot, is benefiting from expressway connectivity, Namo Bharat, and industrial growth, which is driving homebuyers’ demand. If the budget channels more funds and policy attention to cities like Sonipat, it can firmly position growing economic hubs of India as the real driver of the country’s real estate growth.” - Yashank Wason, Managing Director, Royal Green Realty, says, “The upcoming fiscal budget is a crucial opportunity to strengthen real estate, especially in fast-growing Tier II and III cities, which are now effectively challenging metros across segments. These markets are offering infra-led projects, superior amenities and more spacious homes at comparatively reasonable prices, drawing both end-users and investors. Major developers are entering these cities, supported by government policy easing and recent GST relief, helping people enjoy better lifestyles in their hometowns while easing migration pressures. The industry now expects further tax incentives, clarity on GST and continued policy support to sustain safe, long-term real estate investments.” Navdeep Sardana, Founder, Whiteland Corporation says, “The upcoming 2026 union budget is the most anticipated day for Indian real estate. While 2025 saw absorptions in office and premium real estate sectors, there has been a policy push for these segments. The premium segment is looking for a fiscal maturity. With premium real estate now the current trend, industry’s focus has moved beyond tax sops. The most critical expectation for the ultra HNIs is the re-evaluation of Rs 10 crore cap on capital gains reinvestment under sections 54 and 54F. Increasing this limit is important to facilitate the movement of uber-luxury properties. Moreover, we expect the union budget to propel ESG compliant luxury developments and smart housing technology integration via specialised green financing tax credits. Industry expects the budget to introduce policies simplifying availability of finance for developers, providing better liquidity and lower barriers. For NRI investors, a further rationalisation of TDS on property sales would significantly improve foreign capital inflows into India’s growing residential market, which is expected to dominate the 2026 landscape.” Rajan Yadav, Director, Roots Developers, says, “On February 1, 2025, the union budget is expected to provide measures to improve the real estate segment. The industry seeks tax deductions on home loan interest, better subsidies for buyers, and disbursements to reduce EMIs and risks. Such steps can drive growth and urban development while restoring demand in luxury segments. In luxury real estate, sustained demand from HNIs and NRIs will ensure project placement with wellness amenities and ESG compliances, even without direct incentives. A buyer centric budget will make housing purchases more attractive while maintaining luxury real estate’s strong performance.” Mr. Rishabh Periwal, Senior Vice President, Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. says, “According to the latest Cushman & Wakefield report, Delhi-NCR recorded a strong 39% quarter-on-quarter rise in new housing launches in Q4 2025, reflecting sustained buyer confidence. Gurugram led this growth, accounting for a significant share of launches along key growth corridors such as Dwarka Expressway, Golf Course Extension Road, and New Gurugram. With enhanced connectivity to IGI Airport, Delhi, and major commercial hubs like Yashobhoomi and Cyber City, these infrastructure-led developments are reshaping the region’s residential landscape. Homebuyers and investors should focus on such emerging, well-connected micro-markets for long-term value appreciation.” One of the most welcome reforms in 2025 was the government’s decision to remove GST on life insurance. This has made life insurance about 18% more affordable, encouraging more people to secure their families’ futures. While insurers have faced increased operational costs due to the loss of Input Tax Credit (ITC), I am hopeful that increased demand driven by better affordability will help offset this impact. For the upcoming Union Budget, we have three key expectations that will not only benefit the life insurance industry but also help improve financial security for millions of Indians: 1. Better Tax Benefits for Protection and Health Insurance To accelerate insurance penetration and achieve the vision of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’, we are hopeful that the government will consider enhancing tax benefits on life and health insurance. Specifically, we recommend either increasing the current limit or introducing a separate, dedicated section for life insurance premiums. It is also crucial that these tax benefits be extended to both the old and new tax regimes, making insurance more inclusive and accessible to all. 2. Tax Relief on Annuity Plans India is facing a widening retirement savings gap, projected to reach $85 trillion by 2050 [1] .We need to do something to fill this gap. To tackle this, the budget this year can: Extend the ₹50,000 deduction to all pension and annuity products. Reduce tax on annuity payouts, making retirement income more tax-efficient and attractive for savers. Simplifying and enhancing tax benefits for these products will encourage more Indians to invest in long-term income security. 3. Increase Premium Cap for tax-free maturity for ULIPs to ₹5 lakh Today, ULIPs have a ₹2.5 lakh annual premium cap for tax-free maturity. We hope the Budget will raise the ULIP cap to ₹5 lakh, same as traditional products. A uniform cap will make tax benefits easier to understand for everyone. With continued policy support and forward-thinking reforms, the life insurance sector is ready to play a stronger role in safeguarding financial well-being and enabling long-term security for Indian families. “The GST waiver has made life insurance more affordable and accessible. We’re hopeful that this year’s Budget will continue that momentum. Better tax benefits for protection and health plans—under both tax regimes—can help more families get covered. We also hope to see stronger support for pension products and an increase in the premium cap for ULIPs to Rs. 5 Lakh, similar to traditional plans. Simple, inclusive reforms can go a long way in securing India’s financial future and accelerate progress towards ‘Insurance for All by 2047.’” With the pre-Budget approaching, we are hopeful that India is entering an important phase in its medical tourism journey. Policy reforms are recognising medical value travel as a structured, systems-led growth opportunity. Continued investments in healthcare infrastructure, expanding digital health adoption, and improving access for international patients have created a strong foundation. The next phase of growth will depend on clearer policy direction and faster, simpler medical visa processes, along with well-defined cross-border care pathways and patient facilitation standards that reduce uncertainty for families planning treatment. Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar global industry, and India is well positioned to strengthen its leadership with world-class clinicians, advanced hospital networks, and a compelling value proposition centred on outcomes, affordability, and patient experience. Going forward, international patients will increasingly expect transparency, continuity of care, and seamless coordination throughout treatment, travel, and recovery. Strengthening digital health integration, enabling insurance alignment, and supporting accredited patient facilitation platforms will be critical to building trust. Looking to 2026, with the right policy support, India can extend medical tourism beyond metro cities into emerging healthcare hubs, building a more inclusive and resilient ecosystem. “As India’s digital payments ecosystem continues to expand, the Union Budget plays an essential role in reinforcing infrastructure, security, and regulatory clarity. Policies that support secure digital adoption, ease compliance for MSMEs, and encourage innovation can help sustain growth across the fintech sector. For payment aggregators, stable regulatory frameworks and technology-focused incentives are key to scaling responsibly while maintaining trust. Continued focus on cybersecurity, data protection, and ease of doing business will strengthen the overall payments landscape. The direction set through the Budget will influence how fintech players contribute to financial inclusion and build a resilient digital economy in the coming years.” NITCO Limited, a leading player in the tiles, marble, and mosaic industry, has reported a strong 85% growth in sales in December 2025 as compared to January 2025, on a month-on-month basis, reflecting strong business momentum and sustained demand across its product categories. The growth was driven by focused execution, strengthening market presence, and growing customer confidence, marking a significant milestone in NITCO’s journey towards scalable and sustainable growth. Sales momentum was supported by strong customer demand, ongoing product portfolio enhancement, improved distribution reach, and sustained operational efficiencies. Commenting on the performance, Mr. Vivek Talwar, Chairman & Managing Director, NITCO Limited, said, “Achieving 85% growth in sales reflects the strength of our business strategy, the dedication of our teams, and the trust our customers have placed in us. We remain focused on sustainable growth while continuing to invest in innovation, capacity expansion, and customer experience.” Fusion CX, a global customer experience (CX) services provider, today announced the acquisition of Skycom BPO, an El Salvador–based nearshore BPO company with delivery operations across Latin America. The acquisition adds approximately USD 25 million in annualised topline revenue to Fusion CX. The acquisition marks a strategic step in Fusion CX’s expansion across Latin America (including the Caribbean), strengthening its nearshore delivery ecosystem and enhancing its ability to support complex, high-volume CX programs for North American and international clients.

The non-trade prices saw a sharp correction post the GST cut (especially in the South and North), though it recovered partly in Dec-25 along with sequential demand pick up. While the industry’s realisation growth is likely to decline c2% q-q in 3Q, dealers cite optimism of potential price hikes (both trade and non-trade) ahead along with seasonal recovery. · Strong demand pick-up in Dec-25; Heading firm into a seasonally strong 4Q: The industry’s 3Q volume growth rebounded to high single digit, in our view, post a 4-5% growth witnessed in 1HFY26, as construction activities resumed from end Nov-25. Driven by a ramp-up in newly acquired capacities and organic additions, we estimate c15% y-y volume growth for our coverage, led by UTCEM (c21% y-y; c13% LFL), ACEM (c13% y-y) and JKCE (c14%), but a subdued volume growth for SRCM (c3% y-y). · Operating costs to soften q-q; but lower realisations are likely to impact profitability: In 3Q, the average US petcoke prices remained elevated at cUSD120/ton, i.e., close to the Sep-25 exit (+c4% q-q/ c21% y-y), which is likely to exert pressure on P&F costs, though partly offset by the decline in imported coal (South Africa) prices (-c2% q-q) and higher green energy mix. Overall, we expect operating cost/ton to soften c1% q-q owing to operating leverage and the reversal of elevated 2Q fixed cost but see a cINR50/ton q-q decline in EBITDA/ton on lower pricing and subsidy income. · Sector EV/EBITDA near its past 10-year average; Upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral: Prolonged demand weakness stretching to mid-3Q eroded price stability in the previous quarter. However, the recent demand pick-up has raised the probability of near-term price hikes. In our base case, we expect 3Q slippages to recover but don’t see a meaningful hike in 4Q, amidst a year-end volume push. Our preference remains UTCEM and JKCE. We upgrade DALBHARA to Neutral. Strong 2025; compounding should continue in 2026 We have been positive on Indian Telecoms for a while, and telecoms remains among our preferred sector pick in India in 2026 (See 2026 Outlook). The telecom industry’s structure has improved, which is reflected in strong revenue growth over the past years, EBITDA margin improvement and a moderating capex intensity. While valuation multiples have expanded, we expect healthy doubledigit returns led by earnings growth. We see a strong likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 2026, and the sector is tapping new growth drivers, such as home broadband and data centres. Telcos have ramped up their consumer offering by bundling content, cloud and AI, which can eventually be monetised. We like Reliance and Bharti Airtel. We recently downgraded Indus Towers to Neutral. · 2026 should be an eventful year: Jio IPO, tariff hikes, AGR resolution, Indus dividends: We expect 2026 to be an eventful year for the Indian Telecom industry and would watch out for 1) Jio Platforms IPO, which could raise the weightage of the sector in indices; 2) We see high likelihood of a mobile tariff hike in 1H2026; 3) the DoT recently provided relief to VIL on its AGR dues. However, we do not expect this to have any meaningful impact on the Indian mobile market share trends in 2026; 4) non-mobile opportunities, such as home and data center, could see an increase in the share of capex. Increasing adoption of digital services, such as cloud and AI services, creates differentiation opportunities in the near-term (e.g. Jio bundling Google AI Pro) and a possible monetisation opportunity in the medium term. · 3QFY26 should be a relatively stable quarter; healthy growth on the back of stable tariffs: On account of stable India mobile tariffs for over a year, we expect largely stable q-q revenue trends (+2-2.5% q-q for Airtel and Jio). On a y-y basis, sales growth should remain strong and in double digits (c10-11% for Jio/Airtel). EBITDA growth should remain ahead of sales growth for both Airtel and Jio. For Indus, the AGR dues relief for VIL is a positive. However, we recently downgraded the stock to Neutral as the stock has moved by 35% over 1Y and our concerns of weak growth and high maintenance capex keeps us from raising the valuation multiples. As India prepares for the Union Budget, there is a crucial opportunity to reorient healthcare towards prevention and early intervention. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to place a growing burden on individuals, families and public health systems, yet many conditions remain undetected until advanced stages. Strengthening structured screening programmes and enabling technology-led risk assessment can help identify disease earlier, improve outcomes and reduce avoidable hospitalisation. Targeted policy support for preventive health infrastructure, workforce training and data-driven screening models can optimise long-term healthcare spending while easing pressure on tertiary care facilities. Encouraging public-private collaboration and integrating preventive screening into primary care pathways will be key to building a more sustainable system. A forward-looking budget that prioritises early detection, personalised risk profiling and preventive care can help India move from a treatment-centric approach to a healthier, more resilient population. This shift will support affordability, equity, productivity, and long-term national well-being across diverse communities nationwide and sustainably. Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), based on provisional estimates, increased marginally to 0.71% on a month-on-month (M-o-M) basis in December 2025, compared to 0.52% in November 2025, while continuing to remain below the 1% mark, said Mr. Rajeev Juneja, President, PHDCCI, in a press statement issued here today. The marginal uptick in WPI was primarily driven by higher inflation in the Fuel & Power and Manufactured Products groups on a month-on-month basis, he highlighted. Inflation in the Fuel and Power category (weight: 13.15%) rose from 0.90% in November 2025 to 1.23% in December 2025, reflecting increased prices of electricity (4.46%), coal (0.66%), and mineral oils (0.07%) during the month, Mr. Juneja noted. The Manufactured Products group (weight: 64.23%) witnessed an uptrend, moving from a deflation of (-) 0.21% in November 2025 to an inflation of 0.41% in December 2025 on a month-on-month basis. This increase was attributed to higher prices in the manufacture of basic metals, chemicals and chemical products, non-metallic mineral products, textiles, cement, lime and plaster, he added. Dr. Ranjeet Mehta, CEO & Secretary General, PHDCCI, stated that WPI inflation is expected to remain range-bound, supported by benign international crude oil prices, GST rate rationalisation, and healthy rabi crop production. India’s pro-growth pivot takes hold As we write our outlook for India’s economy into 2026, our market call sees Nifty at 30,000 by Mar-27, yielding 15% return vs. 10.1% in CY25, despite global headwinds. This is premised on earnings rebound (14-15% growth in FY27E; 3-5% in FY26E), led by acceleration in sales growth from 6.9% in FY26E to 10.9% in FY27E, and PAT growth from 10.9% in FY26E to 13.3% in FY27E. The earnings uptick will be led by a rebound in nominal GDP growth (earnings sensitivity to GDP growth is ~0.6) and built on a durable foundation of higher incremental free cash flow and improving balance sheet optionality. Expect nominal GDP to grow 10.5% YoY in FY27E from 8.5% YoY in FY26E. EM assets have higher tailwinds in CY26 than DMs: EM assets have higher tailwinds versus DMs – easy financial conditions, moderate inflation, soft DXY and valuation comfort. The asset class leadership is also shifting. The AI theme is past its easy beta phase (selective gains from uniform winners, announcement-led rally to proof of revenue and ROI) and dominance of the US market is dissipating, providing space for under-owned markets and contra-AI trade. India’s relative valuation premium to its EM peers is closer to historical inflection point (1.6x), and an uptick in nominal GDP growth should aid FPI inflows. In past 25 years, peak-to-trough (drawdown) cycles of net FPI equity inflows have been strongly correlated with nominal GDP growth. We see conditions in India being prime for return of FPI inflows. SBI Life launches ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’, a life insurance guaranteed savings plan for long-term financial confidence – ‘SBI Life- Smart Platina Advantage’ is designed to seamlessly support financial needs across life stages with assured, long-term savings and protection India, 14th January 2025: In today’s fast-changing world—where aspirations grow alongside responsibilities—financial security is no longer just about finances, but about certainty, peace of mind, and the ability to protect loved ones through every phase of life. Recognising this need, SBI Life Insurance, one of India’s most trusted private life insurers, launched ‘SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage’, an individual, non-linked, non-participating life insurance savings product that offers long-term guaranteed benefits along with life insurance protection throughout the policy term. Designed to help individuals plan confidently for life’s milestones—be it children’s education, retirement planning, corpus creation, building second income etc., —SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage enables individuals to build a disciplined financial corpus with assured guaranteed additions every policy year. The product combines predictability with flexibility, ensuring one to secure defined maturity outcomes while paying premiums for a limited duration. Key features of SBI Life – Smart Platina Advantage are: · Long-term Guaranteed Benefits with life insurance cover · Pay premiums for a Limited Period while enjoying life cover for entire Policy Term · Tax benefits, as per applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 · Option to receive maturity proceeds in instalments, offering post maturity liquidity and financial flexibility Indian capital markets will continue to prioritise profitability, transparency and strong corporate governance despite a surge in initial public offerings, said Ashish Kumar Chauhan, NSE Chief, during IPO Baatcheet, a special show by Startup Policy Forum (SPF). Chauhan said India’s public markets differ fundamentally from more risk-tolerant markets, with Indian investors, both institutional and retail, placing greater emphasis on sustainable businesses and investor protection. “Broadly speaking, India is about profitability, about transparency and about better corporate governance.” he said. Emphasising the importance of trust in public markets, Chauhan said strong corporate governance remains central to sustaining investor confidence, particularly as retail participation continues to deepen. “Corporate governance is the backbone of this trust. It’s like a pond out of which we all drink… it’s easy to destroy that trust, but very difficult to build,” he said. Addressing founders of listed companies, Chauhan said promoters must recognise the responsibility that comes with managing public capital and consistently prioritise shareholders. “Whenever in doubt, take the decision in favour of the other investors, not yourself. Even if it is legally allowed, don’t do that because morally it may not be correct,” he said, referring to the need to reduce asymmetries of information and power between insiders and public investors. Chauhan cautioned against viewing new-age IPOs as assured wealth creators, noting that long-term outcomes will be determined by post-listing performance over one-, two- and five-year periods. He said public markets carry inherent risks and that returns depend on business fundamentals, governance standards and market cycles. Reflecting on the evolution of India’s capital markets, Chauhan highlighted the growth of retail participation, with over 12 crore unique investors at NSE today, representing nearly 25 per cent of Indian households. He said this reflects increasing trust among households in entrepreneurs and market institutions.

Sharad Mathur, MD and CEO, Universal Sompo General Insurance “Achieving the goal of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’ will require a clear, time-bound roadmap supported by targeted policy and budgetary measures. The focus should be on building shared digital insurance infrastructure such as interoperable platforms and cost-efficient distribution frameworks that can be used across the industry to expand reach, particularly among first-time buyers. The Budget can also play a catalytic role by allocating sustained funding for insurance awareness and literacy initiatives, especially in rural and low-income regions where adoption remains uneven. In parallel, government insurance and welfare schemes should be structured to enable wider participation from private insurers through more consultative and business-friendly frameworks. Together, these measures will help narrow protection gaps, improve affordability and translate the vision of universal insurance into on-ground outcomes.” Alok Rungta, MD and CEO, Generali Central Life Insurance “The forthcoming Union Budget can bring about compelling reform for the life insurance sector by making long-term financial protection more accessible and relevant for today’s families. To achieve this, the limits on tax concessions for life insurance and retirement products must be revisited, as current thresholds do not reflect rising incomes or evolving life-stage needs. Expanding deductions or making incentives easier to claim will significantly boost demand for higher-value policies, especially given the high protection gap in India. Affordability and participation can be improved by simplifying taxation across life insurance products, encouraging pure protection plans and incentivizing long-term savings. Equally important will be policy continuity and regulatory clarity, enabling insurers to plan responsibly and invest for the future.” Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, writes: “The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility. The anchor book was fully subscribed at 1x, with 11.88 crore shares allotted, raising ₹273.13 crore, providing early institutional validation to the issue. Exceptional oversubscription in the NII category reflects strong valuation comfort and expectations of listing gains. Robust participation from retail and shareholder segments highlights broad-based investor interest and trust in the Coal India ecosystem. While QIB demand remained relatively measured, the overall subscription trend points to favourable secondary market sentiment, supported by the scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector.” Executive Centre India Limited has received the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) approval for its proposed initial public offering (IPO).

Rajkumar Subramanian, Head- Products and Family Offices –PL Wealth Management on Silver Outlook, writes: “Silver is emerging as one of the most compelling strategic metals in the current cycle, sitting at the intersection of investment demand and industrial transformation. In India, this dual character is even more pronounced. Beyond its traditional role as a store of value, silver is increasingly driven by structural demand from solar energy, electronics, electric mobility and advanced manufacturing. As India accelerates its renewable and infrastructure ambitions, silver’s industrial relevance strengthens its long-term price support. At the same time, rising retail participation and growing interest from HNI and family capital are positioning silver as a portfolio diversifier alongside gold. However, investors must remain mindful that silver is inherently more volatile than gold, with sharper price swings driven by global growth expectations, dollar movements and speculative flows. It is best approached with disciplined allocation and a medium- to long-term perspective.” Shadowfax's IPO opens January 22 with a price band of ₹118-124, aiming to raise ₹1,907 crore.

Too low for a stagnated economy with declining population. Seniors make up about 30% of Japan’s population. The elephant in the room is Japan has a 236% debt/GDP. Japan’s public debt is $9T phew. This is a doomed economy. It should be the first to collapse, it’s a time-bomb imo. I expect yields on Japanese 10 yr govt bonds to hit 5%+ anytime in 2026. I personally think it’s the biggest short of all govt bonds. Yen will also collapse. Given its financial situation, Japan should be treated like an EM, not DM. All this will push gold prices up & up. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance shares flat on the NSE at Rs 681. It posted a 19.82% year-on-year jump in its standalone net profit to ₹390.20 crore in the third quarter this fiscal. Market analysis by Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com January 14, 2025 Bitcoin steadied near the mid-$90,000 zone over January 13-14 after a choppy start to the month. BTC prices but tested the $95,000 level today and this is a constructive signal after the recent bout of consolidation. The move suggests buyers are defending higher levels even as macro uncertainty persists. On the downside, the $90,000-$92,000 band continues to act as a key support zone. Sustained acceptance above $95,000 would be required to open the door for a fresh leg higher and any failure to hold this range could invite renewed range trading. Institutional positioning showed early signs of stabilisation. After several sessions of heavy redemptions, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a strong net inflow on January 13 and helped arrest downside momentum. Derivatives markets reflected a more balanced stance as funding rates normalised and liquidation activity remained contained. This indicates a leverage reset rather than forced capitulation. On-chain data also point to a cooling of aggressive profit-taking. Realised profits have moderated sharply from late-2025 peaks. Momentum indicators have reverted toward neutral territory and this is consistent with consolidation above prior breakout levels rather than distribution. Among major altcoins, Ethereum held firm above $3,000. BNB traded largely in the $930-$960 range and found support near recent lows. Solana oscillated between roughly $135 and $150 and reflected continued interest in high-throughput layer-1s even as volatility stayed elevated. XRP hovered around the $2.05-$2.15 band and consolidated after earlier gains. Overall, altcoin performance remained mixed and showed selective strength. Rotation into altcoins continues to be tactical rather than trend-defining, with traders unwilling to commit aggressively ahead of clearer macro and Bitcoin-led direction. Macro cues continue to dominate sentiment. Markets are tracking US inflation data, Federal Reserve guidance, and energy price movements, all of which are influencing global risk appetite and crypto flows. Our advice: Bitcoin’s ability to test $95,000 is a positive structural sign, but this remains a range-bound, event-driven market. Traders should respect the $90,000 support, avoid high leverage, and add exposure only on confirmed spot-led strength. Prioritise BTC and ETH over high-beta altcoins until macro clarity improves and price acceptance above resistance is sustained. Mitra merges with Tierra Agrotech in a ₹787 crore deal, creating a robust agri-food platform ahead of its IPO. Should you hold or exit the Nifty 50 25700-call?

Hurrah? Not quite yet Believe investor focus will now shift to operating profit (PPOP), & there are likely to be PPOP cuts going forward This will be driven by the culmination of multiple factors: modest loan growth, NIM pressure and slower fee income.

Retail protection growth was strong at 40% YoY in 3QFY26, aided by GST removal. ULIP sales picked up, while management also highlighted a pick-up in non-par sales.

Large-scale retail brokers are in a transitionary phase—shifting to one-stop platforms for financial products distribution from pure-play broking-led market proxies. Angel’s aggressive customer acquisition strategy and demonstrated business agility underpin constructive stance. Niche market leadership, customer-centric approach driving high brand recall and lean business structure generating elevated operating efficiencies augur well for Groww. Cross-sell potential is high for both, aided by confluence of rapidly expanding product bouquet and a large and swiftly expanding captive customer base. While market volatility and regulatory headwinds weigh in, nascency of Indian markets and regime change in financial products’ purchase journey position the transformational plays in a sweet spot. Re-rating is contingent on effective business diversification. Our Capital Markets preference: wealth>brokers (large)>AMC>RTA. Prefer Angel over Groww currently due to its brand re-positioning and steady business diversification whilst benign valuation. Angel: ‘Buy’ — Angel has demonstrated business agility by smoothly transitioning to a digital-first broking platform from a traditional one.

EPS CAGR +26% over FY2026-29E. Re-rating contingent on prudent execution of revenue diversification strategy. Groww: ‘Buy’ — Groww’s customer-centric approach, first-mover advantage in direct MF and leadership in retail broking driving high brand recall and elevated cross-sell potential to a large captive customer pool (average active users +61% CAGR over FY2023-25) augur well for revenue accretion.

Fii: -1678 Dii: +1323 -- Bloomberg - Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year. - Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion. - High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million. Morgan Stanley increased bonuses by about 20% for bankers in Asia after the firm closed in on a record $10 billion in revenue from the region last year, people familiar with the matter said. Revenue jumped on outsized gains in equity trading, prime brokerage and wealth management, the people said. The investment banking and capital markets divisions also regained momentum, with fees from stock sales and mergers approaching $1 billion, the most in years, they added, asking not to be identified because the numbers are confidential. A media representative for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The Asia record has set traders and bankers up for a robust bonus season. Overall, investment bankers got a 15% to 20% bump for the past year while traders and product specialists in the institutional equity division got more, with top performers seeing increases of at least 30%, the people said. High-performing managing directors across country banking and booming sectors such as technology are expected to receive total compensation including bonuses of $2 million to $2.5 million, the people said. Average compensation of $1 million to $1.5 million represents a sharp contrast to 2024, the people said, after about a fifth of managing directors received no bonuses that year. Morgan Stanley reported $7.64 billion in revenue from Asia in 2024, accounting for about 12% of the New York bank’s global total. That topped arch-rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the third year in a row. Morgan Stanley’s Asia head Gokul Laroia told Bloomberg in a rare interview last year that he was eyeing $10 billion in revenue within five years. Trading momentum in the final quarter helped the firm near its goal much sooner than that. Morgan Stanley’s Asia revenue, which includes Japan and Australia, rose 29% to $7.27 billion for the nine months ended in September. The boon echoed a global revenue surge, with stock traders beating expectations as US President Donald Trump’s policies kept markets on edge. The bank is slated to announce its 2025 earnings on Thursday, joining several Wall Street firms releasing results this week. Despite a record year in Asia, Morgan Stanley cautioned against raising bonuses too sharply, aiming to smooth compensation. Factors such as share-price gains and a large junior workforce tempered growth in the overall bonus pool, another person said. Some 26 bankers and staff in Asia were promoted to managing directors, spanning equity, investment banking and fixed-income divisions, the people said. Dhaval Ajmera, Director – Corporate Affairs, Ajmera Group “The real estate sector has emerged as one of the major contributors to economic growth. In order to keep the momentum rolling and further pick up the pace, we expect the ministry to announce policy reforms and remedial measures in the upcoming budget that will benefit the buyers and developers alike. Most importantly, the sector expects to waive the cap currently placed on home loans and introduce tax benefits on the interest paid by buyers, irrespective of the ticket size. This will, in turn, be a mega-booster for the economy and will have a great run in the Indian real estate ecosystem. Equally significant is the need to truly accelerate India’s transition to Net Zero. In relation to this, we urge the Ministry to introduce an Interest Subvention Scheme - specifically for Green-Rated Real Estate Debt. While developers are keen to build sustainable, IGBC/LEED-certified projects, the sky-high cost of capital remains a major barrier. As a remedial measure, a government-backed subvention of 200-300 basis points on Green Bonds would directly reduce the borrowing costs, making green projects financially viable rather than just aspirational. Last but not least, we look forward to a rationalisation of GST on residential projects and redefine the terminology of affordable housing from price-oriented to measurability, as this will be the last mile help in formalizing the Housing for All dream of the honourable PM.” Ashish Munjal, Co-founder and CEO, SUNSTONE Budget 2026 is an opportunity to transform India’s demographic dividend into a genuinely future ready workforce. To be able to address the growing skills gap, we need to have a major allocation of funds for project-led programs in artificial intelligence, data science, and other emerging technologies, besides investment in multilingual digital learning platforms under Digital India. This means funding not just content, but labs, faculty development, and industry led projects that bring NEP’s vision to life inside classrooms. Affordability, however, remains the biggest barrier for millions of deserving students, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 India. The Central government can ease this by expanding interest free or subsidised education loans on an EMI model, strengthening credit guarantees, and increasing the scholarship corpus for under-served communities. At the same time, tax deductions on individual and corporate spend towards recognised skill certifications will normalise lifelong learning. In the same way that health insurance has become standard, we need to provide incentives through “employer sponsored learning credits” with tax incentives and cofunding structures that make it attractive for companies to invest in campus talent and early-career upskilling. Doing so would sharply improve employability outcomes and hasten India’s march toward a resilient, innovation-driven economy. Trump said tariffs are driving record investment, boosting wages and curbing inflation, warning of major fallout if the Supreme Court strikes them down. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said fresh sanctions will be proposed against those behind Iran’s protest crackdown as deaths rise and pressure mounts on Tehran. India and France discussed defence, technology and nuclear cooperation under Make in India as Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne led strategic talks. India is considering a dedicated rocket-cum-missile force to counter China and Pakistan, Army chief says, as military reforms and modernisation accelerate.
