Title: Single-Stock ETF Market Swells With Firehose of New Products

Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the single-stock ETF. While the number of leveraged single-stock ETFs in the US more than doubled in the first four months of the year, things may just be getting started. In the past few weeks alone, dozens of such products have been filed for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those include 10 ETFs from Themes, 14 from Defiance, and 12 from LevMax. To put those numbers in perspective, there were a total of 42 leveraged single-stock ETFs on the market at the beginning of the year, according to Morningstar Direct data. The first such products appeared after the SEC approved the concept in 2022. “Retail investors have long desired to have institutional trading options for a long period of time, but they’ve been hamstrung, because options can be difficult, shorting can be difficult, and there are all sorts of risks that can be associated with those things,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer of Themes ETFs. The most aggressive of the proposed products are the triple-leveraged LevMax ETFs. Those funds have “a predetermined upside return cap” but also seek to limit downside by “matching any negative performance of the underlying security on a one-to-one basis,” the prospectuses state. Themes, whose US ETF assets just surpassed $100 million, would seek “accelerated returns” with caps on the potential upside on five ETFs using at-the-money calls with a one-month expiration. The upside cap would come from selling two call options. “This is just an innovative way to use period-certain leveraged exposure to some of the most popular names,” Marino said. “It’s a way to offer accelerated returns without taking accelerated risk.” Other ETFs in the works take different approaches: Rolling the Dice: The rise in leveraged ETFs “is super-connected with this surge in sports betting we’ve seen,” said Victor Haghani, founder of Elm Wealth. While there is a potential use case for young investors with low financial capital having some leverage via an S&P 500 ETF, even that instance would be difficult to justify, he said. With $100 invested in a 2X ETF, for example, “the cost of leverage is always going to be much higher than Treasury bills,” he said. “That second $100 (of exposure via leverage) isn’t really giving you anything.” There is no case for leveraged single-stock ETFs, he said. Even if a stock were to maintain its price over time, any volatility would lead to leveraged ETFs rebalancing often and creating a drag on net returns, not to mention fees, he said. “What you get is not what most people think they’re going to get.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside
