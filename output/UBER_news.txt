Title: Tesla robotaxi incidents spark confusion and concerns in Austin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: The Graduate: A Slick BMW Boxer Bobber Built From R65 and R100 Parts
URL: https://www.bikeexif.com/bmw-boxer-bobber
Time Published: 2025-07-04T17:01:01Z
Full Content:
You might not know Sam Clercx’s name, but you’ve seen his work. He launched his career at the tender age of 15 as an intern at Ironwood Motorcycles, under the guidance of Arjan van den Boom. He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine. Most of my friends had jobs in supermarkets or cafés and I was helping build these amazing-looking and sounding custom bikes.” The niggles associated with classic motorcycles are partly why meneer van den Boom hit pause on Ironwood a few years ago. But Sam still has an affinity for the beloved BMW boxer motor. So he built up this R65 basket case as a side project, while completing another internship—this time at Motoism in Munich. “After Arjan closed up his shop and stopped building his boxers, I got a chance to buy a 1979 BMW R65 in parts, for cheap,” says Sam. “Thanks, in part, to Arjan and other people building wonderful machines out of these old R-series BMWs, the prices rose significantly, putting a nice riding rolling base out of my price range. I grabbed the opportunity and slowly started envisioning my perfect twin-valve custom.” “With a tight budget, but plenty of time, I picked up the neglected R65 in boxes. The short R65 frame and swingarm, paired with R100 cylinders, pistons, and heads, offered an affordable path to the quick, agile airhead I always wanted.” In stock form, the R100 makes about 25 hp more than the R65—so rebuilding the engine with R100 parts was a good call on Sam’s part. He also added BMW R100RS badges to the engine block to tease the engine’s true capacity, and adorned the heads with classic peanut covers. The airbox was swapped for pod filters, and the space it left behind was filled with a 3D-printed cover, housing a NOCO NLP9 battery. Sam scalped more R100 parts for the front end, fitting the lowered forks and twin Brembo brakes from a BMW R100RS. The R65 retains its drum brake and snowflake rims, which are now shod with Shinko E-270 tires. “It was a great help throughout the build to have a lot of spare parts from Arjan sitting in my garage,” he adds. “Small stuff like seals, throttle cables, and a lot of wiring—but also some nice bling parts.” A pair of aftermarket shocks props up the rear, connected to a custom-made stepped subframe. Lower down, the unsightly brackets that normally hold the mufflers and passenger pegs were trimmed down, leaving just enough space for the latter. “While style was obviously important, I didn’t want to sacrifice function,” Sam adds. “There are, of course, more practical bikes out there, but I set out to strike a balance between function and form: keeping it a two-seater and asking the talented Tom Hurley to make the seat as comfortable and waterproof as possible, while keeping it slim; adding tie-down points under the seat for my luggage; and fitting modern LEDs for good visibility at night, along with reliable electronics. I’m a rider first and a builder second.” Keeping with this philosophy, Sam fabricated a pair of short fenders for the bike and protected the fork stanchions with fresh rubber boots. A chromed LED headlight sits out front, nailing the mix of classic style and modern reliability that Sam was after. The headlight is neatly tucked into a 3D-printed fairing that was inspired by the plug-and-play fork covers that Motoism produces. It includes integrated Motoism turn signals, with a tidy housing for a slim Motogadget Motoscope Mini speedo up top. Other Motogadget bits include the bike’s keyless RFID ignition, and the company’s mo.unit blue module, around which the whole bike was rewired. The fairing also helps to route the cockpit’s cables and houses, making for an uber-neat setup. Wide handlebars sport vintage-style grips, a MessnerMoto throttle, and modern push-buttons with internal wiring. Tarozzi foot controls round out the control package. Motoism’s influence is clear in the BMW’s rear lighting too. Sam designed and 3D-printed his own taillight housing, equipping it with powerful LED internals. The rear turn signals are Motoism parts too, but the bracket that holds them is a one-off. The boxer’s glorious two-into-one exhaust headers were created by Sam’s good friend Chiel Nipius (of Nius Moto). They’re matched to a Spark silencer to create an appropriately throaty rumble. The most striking thing about this BMW boxer bobber is how well judged every last part and finish is—from the refinished motor to the period-correct pin striping and blacked-out tank roundels. “The color scheme was inspired by a picture of a classic Porsche 356 convertible I found—black leather, chrome silver, and this stunning blue,” explains Sam. “It was perfectly executed by Royal Kustom Works on the tank, fenders, and front fairing.” Now that his BMW R65/R100 is complete, Sam plans to take it on a few trips before selling it to make way for the next project. But first, it’s being exhibited as his official graduation project at the Utrecht School of the Arts. If it were up to us, we’d give him full marks.

Title: I’m a retiree with $900k cash but no home. How do I make it last? - Mary Holm

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. There's no need for your 80s to be sad. Photo / 123RF Q: I am a twice-married woman of 70. I have not come out of either marriage settlement well. For six years now, I’ve been living with a friend in a large, comfortable home. However, it is not a great situation and I really need to be out of it. My problem is that I have three children with families who all live in the Auckland area, and I would like to be located so that I can see them easily. They all lived offshore for a long time and now they are all here. I am so lucky. I have all up around $1 million, although $100,000 is on loan to my daughter to enable her to buy a home. My only income is the pension (I guess you’ve heard this all before!), but I am hopeful of living these next few years as I would like to live. Clearly, my 80s look sad. I am English-born, lived in Australia and met my Kiwi husband and moved to NZ. My 20-year marriage ended, and five years later I met my second husband. We had a business together which was successful, but he mismanaged our funds (he being the only director) and then left to live a nomadic life! My circumstances need to be addressed. I do not know if renting is wise as I’d hate to continually move, and my money would only allow me to buy something tiny anywhere near my only family in NZ. Is there any solution to this? I have been harbouring this problem for far too long, and I must move on. A: Let’s set you on a more positive path – not just for now but for your future. There’s no need for your 80s or beyond to be sad. I think renting, rather than tying up your savings in a small property that doesn’t appeal to you, is the way to go. You’ve got $900,000 available now. If you plan to live on that from now until you’re 90, you could spend $45,000 a year – in addition to NZ Super - even if you were earning no return on the savings. But if you earn 3% a year, after fees and tax, you could spend $60,000 a year – or $5000 a month - according to an online regular withdrawal calculator. What about when you’re 90? Many people report they can live comfortably on just NZ Super at that stage – although they tend to be homeowners. But by then, it would surely be reasonable for your daughter to repay your $100,000 loan, which you could use to supplement your Super. There are a few issues to consider here: If you prefer to just put the lot in bank deposits, your return would probably average above 2% a year after tax, and you could spend $4500 a month. You can make this work! Footnote 1: Cash-poor retired homeowners might want to consider selling their homes and renting in much the same way. Many people wouldn’t dream of doing that. But they would have considerably more spending money. Footnote 2: In your story, there is a message for other women whose husbands run the money side of a joint business: Be involved. Please. Q: I write regarding last week’s letter about landlords being charitable for too long and needing to raise rents. Landlords need to remember that their market is individuals with limits on what they can pay in rent. These individuals are not a charity to support indigent landlords. Of course, landlords can raise rents, but they may not find tenants. I see this in the apartment block where I own my home. Rents range from $500 per week for a studio to $750 for a two-bedroom. Lovely tenants moved out because the landlord raised the rent at lease renewal time. Apartments have been vacant for weeks until landlords got more realistic and reduced the asking price, in at least one case to below the previous rent. My renting neighbours are professionals on good incomes, the only people who can afford to rent here. I am a single superannuitant and could not afford to rent an apartment in my building. As an owner, my outgoings are around $6500 per annum, which I can afford. Obviously, a landlord’s outgoings also include mortgage repayments. But with the substantial rents my neighbours pay, I am surprised that landlords can’t cover their costs, particularly now that interest is tax-deductible. Possibly some landlords didn’t look carefully at risks and returns and are too highly geared, but I don’t see why tenants should pay for landlords’ poor business decisions. A: Your observations are interesting. A key factor in how well a rental property investment works for the landlord is the size of their mortgage. With no mortgage, most rents would easily cover expenses, but with a large mortgage, the interest payments can kill the short-term profitability. On the other hand, the bigger the mortgage, the bigger the long-term return the landlord stands to gain on their original investment – as long as property values rise. That’s the risk highly geared property investors take. Usually it works, or certainly has in the past. But if property values fall or stagnate, landlords with big mortgages they are struggling to pay are sometimes forced to sell at a loss. Expecting tenants to rescue them by paying rent above market rates is unrealistic. Q: You get lots of letters from landlords that focus on the social service they are doing by having properties that people can rent. There is no question that we need a stock of rental properties, but there are two points that many seem to miss. The first is that landlords, when they purchase properties to rent out, add demand to a limited supply of properties, and help raise the price. Secondly, when they threaten to leave the market, they will argue that there will be fewer properties for people to rent. That’s not true if the property is bought by another landlord. And if it’s bought by someone moving from rental to home ownership, then there is also one less person looking to rent. Unless they decide to leave the property vacant - highly unlikely - the total number of houses does not change when a landlord exits the market. A: You’re quite right on both points. If someone wants to own more than one house – so they can rent one property out – that must push up demand, and therefore prices. Several other readers also made your second point. One added that, if a previous tenant is able to buy a house from a landlord who has left the market, “from an overall societal perspective, this is a very good thing”. Also, she says, “I understand that the new healthy homes regulations are persuading some landlords to sell. Brilliant.” More on landlords and tenants next week. Q: Many years ago, I would read your weekly NZ Herald Q&A commentary (back in the days when the paper was known as conservative Granny Herald). Your bias against residential rental property was evident. You pushed for a capital gains tax and now quite possibly want a wealth tax in NZ. I also recall that your underlying views appeared to be somewhat socialist. Beyond this, I appreciate that you were giving advice to those who were not as financially literate as yourself. Over the many years my rental properties have appreciated in value, and now that, at retirement, I am mortgage-free, I have plenty of income and the benefit of capital gains. Also excellent long-term tenants and nicely renovated properties. Landlords have been particularly demonised in the last 10 or so years, and a culture of envy has developed against those who work to get ahead. We now have so many on a benefit (including NZ Super) that we have become unproductive as a nation. So the few work hard to support those who either don’t want to work or who can’t. I chanced upon an item online from your column back on February 24 last year asking the question, “Should we, the uber-rich and ‘chauffeured’!, be retiring ... at 85!” - whilst I was researching how I can financially help family by setting up a super fund for them, here and in Oz. Surely you are taking the mickey and invented this story? Otherwise, the couple must have dementia or cognitive impairment to write this nonsense to you. If, by some stretch of the imagination, there was some truth to what this couple wrote, the only purpose in publishing it was to engender envy and hatred, or dismay at best. It is great to stir the pot of green envy in NZ, as the left need the support of their “besties”, the media, including columns like yours, to further their agenda. Also, no wonder trust in the media, as revealed in recent polls, is at an all-time low, including distrust of our institutions and politicians, who also introduce legislation by stealth. Not to mention experts whose comments are all “politicised” today, and a left-biased judiciary and universities. Constant cherry-picking, an unbalanced distortion of the facts, running to their own narrative and pushing their agenda. There are still more than a few of us who are immune to all the propaganda and were educated in free thought. I do fear many will be departing our shores, though, given the push to greater socialism and redistribution of wealth in this country, and the racial divisions and subsequent erosion of democracy. A: Gosh. It must be hard being unhappy with beneficiaries, people who get NZ Super, the media, institutions and politicians, the judiciary and universities. You’ve well and truly broken the 200-word limit for letters, but you raise some interesting points. My comments: You acknowledge that some people can’t work. Along with setting up financial help for your family, it would be wonderful if you donated to charities that support these people. It might make you happier – I mean that sincerely. * Mary Holm, ONZM, is a freelance journalist, a seminar presenter and a bestselling author on personal finance.
