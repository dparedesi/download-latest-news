Chinese autonomous driving technology company Pony.ai Inc has listed its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s (HKEX) Main Board, with the issue of 48.25 million shares priced at HKD 139. The share issue is expected to have generated total proceeds of HKD 7.7 billion (US$ 991 million), making it the world’s largest IPO in the autonomous driving sector in 2025. The share price in Hong Kong dropped by 13% to HKD 124 when the market opened. Dr James Peng, Founder and CEO of Pony.ai, said in a statement: “After nearly nine years of relentless innovation and exploration, Pony.ai stands on the brink of large-scale commercialization in autonomous driving. Years of technological advancement, real-world deployment, and ecosystem building are now coming to a moment of fruition. Our Hong Kong listing represents not only a critical step in our capital strategy but also a significant milestone in connecting with global markets and resources. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has walked this journey with us.” The gold standard of business intelligence.

Its shares, listed at HKD 27.1 per share, fell by over 13% when the market opened. WeRide’s founder and CEO, Dr Tony Han, said on the day of the listing: “We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society.” Competition in the global robotaxi business is heating up, with Pony.ai and WeRide up against larger competitors such as Baidu’s Apollo Go in China and Alphabet’s Waymo in the US. Stellantis recently formed a new partnership with Uber, with Nvidia and Taiwan’s Foxconn as their technology partners. Another Chinese automotive company, components maker Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corporation, also listed its shares on the HKEX on the same day, priced at HKD 22, before closing down by 8% at HKD 20.24.

Title: WeRide’s CEO pitches robotaxis as a solution to aging populations and long commutes, as the firm raises more money for R&D with a HK IPO

Nicholas Gordon is an Asia editor based in Hong Kong, where he helps to drive Fortune’s coverage of Asian business and economics news. Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech. WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme. “We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.” Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.” Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year. Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment. Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards. The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024. Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%. WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close. WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%. Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models. Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans. “Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.” Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.” There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.” That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.” WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024. Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch. Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies. Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles. China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles. Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year. Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe. By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London. Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it? “When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said. “If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?” Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

November 05, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. HONG KONG, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (HKEX: 0800.HK, NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its successful listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEX) under the stock code 0800.HK, becoming the world's first Robotaxi company to be publicly traded on both Hong Kong and US exchanges. With that, WeRide also becomes the world's first Robotaxi and autonomous driving technology company to achieve a dual primary listing on both HKEX and NASDAQ. Under its Hong Kong listing, WeRide issued a total of 88.25 million shares (pre-greenshoe), with 17.65 million shares offered publicly and 70.60 million shares for international placement. The offer price was set at HKD 27.1 per share, raising a total of approximately HKD 2.39 billion (pre-greenshoe). Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, had voluntarily committed to a three-year lock-up on October 28, 2025, pledging not to sell any of his shares for the next three years. This demonstrated the founder's and management team's confidence in WeRide's fundamentals and growth, as well as their full commitment to the company's long-term vision and global expansion. "We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society," said Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, at the listing ceremony. Founded in 2017, WeRide was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on October 25, 2024, becoming the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi and universal autonomous driving technology company. The HKEX listing broadens its investor base and access to capital markets, enabling deeper investment in technology R&D and accelerating the global deployment of its autonomous vehicle fleet. Powered by its proprietary WeRide One universal autonomous driving technology platform, WeRide offers Level 2 to Level 4 (L4) products and services across smart mobility, smart logistics, and smart sanitation, including the Robotaxi, Robobus, Robosweeper, Robovan and ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). With WeRide GENESIS, its self-developed, closed-loop simulation engine, WeRide has also significantly lowered road testing costs and safety risks, accelerating product iteration efficiency, market expansion speed, and commercial deployment scale. Currently, WeRide is the only technology company in the world with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries – China, the UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, France, Belgium, and the US. The company operates a fleet of more than 1,500 L4 vehicles, including over 700 Robotaxis. Partnering with Uber in Abu Dhabi, WeRide operates the largest commercial Robotaxi fleet outside of China and the US. Looking ahead, WeRide plans to deploy tens of thousands of Robotaxis by 2030. On industry collaboration, WeRide continues to attract leading global investors and ecosystem partners, building a strategic network with companies such as NVIDIA, Bosch, Uber, Grab, and Renault-Nissan. It is also the only autonomous driving company to receive investment commitments from ride-hailing giants Uber and Grab, highlighting its strategic position and leading role in the industry. WeRide has achieved multiple key milestones in the global commercial deployment of L4 autonomous vehicles. In China, fully driverless WeRide Robotaxis are now commercially operating in Guangzhou and Beijing, with 24-hour autonomous services extended to major transport hubs such as airports and train stations. In core markets such as the Middle East and Singapore, WeRide maintains a first-mover advantage of at least 1.5 years over its competitors. In European countries such as France, Switzerland, and Belgium, WeRide is the only autonomous driving company to have commercially deployed an L4 vehicle fleet. In the ADAS sector, WeRide and Bosch’s jointly developed one-stage end-to-end assisted driving solution has successfully reached SOP and is set to enter mass production in 2025. These developments demonstrate the global adaptability and competitiveness of WeRide’s technology and business model across various regions. With strong technology competence and a global commercial footprint, WeRide has been recognized internationally, including twice on Fortune's Change the World list – the only autonomous driving company to date – and twice on Fortune's Global Future 50, ranking 16th this year, the highest among Chinese companies. Following its dual primary listing on HKEX and NASDAQ, WeRide remains committed to its mission of transforming urban living with autonomous driving. The company will continue to advance autonomous driving technology, expand global commercial operations, and work with partners worldwide to build a safer, more efficient, comfortable, and sustainable smart mobility ecosystem.
