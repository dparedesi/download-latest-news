Séamas O'Reilly on the year's biggest con, AI. This is a Christmas Cracker Gist. An invited essay by Séamas O'Reilly Joseph "Yellow Kid" Weil is something of a legend.The self-proclaimed “master swindler” was the paragon of the early twentieth century con man. In his time, he posed as the immaculately tailored owner of a talking dog, a medicine show huckster, an oil-field prospector and an infinite number of prestigious businessmen reluctantly cajoled into sharing a surefire stock tip - for a price. He plied his trade on street corners, boardrooms, race-tracks and betting shops, separating his marks from their money via means so ingenious many of them have lived on a century later. If you’ve seen the ruse which serves as the centre point of 1973 crime caper The Sting, you’ll know one of his greatest hits; the fake bookie’s shop, staffed with dozens of stooges, all working in concert to con one rich mark out of his money. He’s said to have scammed Benito Mussolini out of $2 million and, in 1899, was widely reported to have sold a perfectly unremarkable chicken to an oil baron for the measly price of a thumb sized piece of pure gold. That last wheeze was, in fact, so widely reported that it lives on in the foodstuff which was subsequently named in his honour; the chicken nugget. In Weil’s marvellous memoir, Con Man, there is scarcely a paragraph that doesn’t induce lip-smacking glee at his audacity, or the bottomless reserve of credulity he encounters from sober, serious people who, surely you think, should know better. His true genius, conveyed in great detail, was in diagnosing the psychology of the mark, which is to say the psychology of the human soul. In the business of offering “something for nothing”, the person you’re conning is almost always your co-conspirator. "Each of my victims” he writes, “had larceny in his heart.". I return to Weil’s scams, and his judgments of human nature, often. I see them each time, say, a billionaire runs for the American presidency on a platform of helping the downtrodden by cutting taxes for his wealthy friends, or a cohort of British elites succeed in selling ‘sovereignty and independence’ for the measly price of a place within the world’s largest trading bloc. Increasingly, however, I see it most prominently in the vaunted halls of tech, and nowhere more regularly than in the field of AI. To be clear at the outset, there are obviously elements of AI which show promise. The elimination of many rote and tedious tasks in our daily labours should be greeted as a boon, and AI’s work in highly specialised and technical tasks could prove more exciting still. Early developments in linguistics and pattern recognition already suggest that AI could, and hopefully will, lead to terrific advances in everything from ancient translation to early diagnosis of disease. In such use-cases, however, there is very little guff about this technology’s sentience, nor mention of that dreaded unicorn “artificial general intelligence”. They are simply ingenious and exciting tools which have solid and encouraging applications but do not, crucially, gesture toward an omniscience that does not exist, and which be undesirable if it did. As an ordinary internet user, I despise almost every in-road into my life that AI has made in the past few years, from incompetent chat services to bafflingly inchoate Google search functions, and the deadening churn of bots on every social media platform left alive. There are dozens of terrible AI versions of my own book being freely sold on Amazon, one of which I even bought in a futile attempt to scry its contents for some form of meaning. As someone in the creative field, I am sympathetic to the most common critique of AI within that sphere – namely, that its ‘artistic’ output amounts to lazy, error-riddled garbage which is morally and stylistically repulsive, while plagiarising and undercutting actual human artists – but this only nibbles at the edges of how I feel about the topic. Because my main problem with AI is not that that it creates ugly, immoral, boring slop (which it does). Nor even that it disenfranchises artists and impoverishes workers, (though it does that too). No, my main problem with AI is that its current pitch to the public is suffused with so much unsubstantiated bullshit, that I cannot banish from my thoughts the sight of a well-dressed man peddling a miraculous talking dog. The claims made by AI evangelists are so broad and plentiful that compiling a pleasingly long paragraph of purported use-cases is as simple as Googling “AI + [noun]”. Having now done just that, I am happy to report that AI will apparently make you rich, find you a date, make you a better lover, a better parent, a better writer, a better worker, a better boss, a better person, a better soldier, will fight all wars, end all wars, hobble terrorists, empower terrorists, make you immortal, end crime, cause crime, solve the housing crisis, revolutionise architecture, cure cancer, and make you a perfect creamy fettuccine with pineapple and cashew sauce. Some of the above links are more nuanced in their prescriptions, but all advance the same basic claim: AI has world-changing implications for just about every concept or phenomenon you can name, and several you can’t. The problem is, AI is not only unfit to do many of those tasks better (or even more cheaply) than humans, but if it was, in several cases, I’d set fire to every server farm I could find and urge you to do the same. Let’s take Large Language Models as an example, since they’re the most well-known piece of broadly usable AI tech on the market. Much of their notoriety stems from the fact that its hallucinations are so infamous as to be cliché. We all, I’m sure, have our favourites, like meal planners that recommend putting glue on pizza and eating three rocks a day; mushroom foraging bots which suggest users cook and prepare entirely fatal fungi; or supermarket apps that cheerfully prescribe recipes for “aromatic water” AKA chlorine gas. It should be observed that such examples are not merely failures because they advocate things that kill their users (although this is not ideal) but because they take the place of existing repositories of information which had little-to-no use case for replacement. In so doing, they’ve also managed to muddy the waters of online information gathering to the point that that even if we scrubbed every trace of those hallucinations from the internet – a likely impossible task - the resulting lack of trust could never quite be purged. Imagine, if you will, the release of a car which was not only dangerous and unusable in and of itself, but which made people think twice before ever entering any car again, by any manufacturer, so long as they lived. How certain were you, five years ago, that an odd ingredient in an online recipe was merely an idiosyncratic choice by a quirky, or incompetent, chef, rather than a fatal addition by a robot? How certain are you now? Some quibble and say that these are just teething problems, the inevitable – even amusing – first steps of a technology finding its feet. But that next step, itself, seems illusory. The scaling of AI to something more workable will require geometrically more investment and computing power than the squillions it has already swallowed up on its path to being the current shit product that nobody trusts. Even enthusiastic reporting on the success of OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, can’t avoid mentioning that the company is on track to lose $5 billion this year. Up to now, their financing has been driven by massive cash injections from the same cheery ranks of hedge funds, soft banks, and petrostates which have propped up every loss-making company you can name for the last decade, from Uber to WeWork to FTX. As recently as July, we saw signs that the market might not be quite as enthusiastic about doing so anymore. It may not be a bubble, but it certainly looks reasonably bubble-shaped, leading tech writer Ed Zitron to convincingly argue we should be referring to the sector as “Subprime AI”. Cory Doctorow goes further in arguing our only task going forward should be working out what kind of bubble it is, the kind that leaves something behind, or the kind that does not. The cost, both financially and in terms of energy resources, of making good on the promises of Artificial General Intelligence are so vast as to approach Death Star numbers, before we even contend with logistical problems of training AI in the first place. The pool of real-world information on which AI has yet to be trained is not merely dwindling but is, itself, now so polluted by AI-generated content that this task is rendered more difficult still. Chlorine gas air defusers and superglue pizzas are all well and good when they’re merely poisoning amateur cooks, but they have also poisoned the very well from which AI must now train itself, and separating out the hallucinations from real information grows more difficult with every line of robot doggerel these same companies ceaselessly barf into the digital ether. All of which is to elide the real harms of this technology we currently see in the world around us. In his recent, and spectacular, takedown of current AI orthodoxy, The Phony Comforts Of Useful Idiots, Edward Ongweso Jr lists some harrowing examples, such as the incompetent crime detection software currently putting American criminal justice in the hands of the machine, the discriminatory welfare algorithm which wrongly accused 26,000 Dutch families of fraud, and the ongoing use of AI to enable the ‘mass assassination factory’ of Gaza. In all such cases, AI’s “errors” are both devastating, and hard to even label as errors at all, so much as a bleakly useful abrogation of responsibility for the bad actors intent on protecting the dystopian interests of those in power. It is not the thought of eight fingered portraits or garbled auto-generated novels which prompt me to indulge in cheery reveries of burning server farms to the ground. It is the spectre of yet more dehumanised populations, preyed upon by dehumanised systems of state violence. I hate AI because it does not work at most of the things its promoters claim it does, and many of the things it does do are explicitly evil. Its missteps not only kill but dissolve the fragile fabric of trust in information we have left. The jargon of AI boosterism, like NFTs and cryptocurrency before them, has seized the imaginations of punters and investors who believe they’re being led to a world of ease and profit that will change the world and make them filthy rich in the process. It’s the last true “something for nothing” we have left, delivered via mechanisms so abstruse to the lay person that its powers can be described with the folkloric hyperbole of a magic chicken. As a teen, I first encountered Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, and marvelled at its concision. I was too slow, however, to realise the transitive property hidden within his neat equation: if all technology is just magic we don’t yet understand, then any old bollocks can be marketed as technology, so long as it’s conveyed to us via a mage class of tech wizards with a passion for turtlenecks, eugenics, and the removal of vowels from proper nouns. It’s a boom time for our new medicine men. Joseph Weil has nothing on them. Wednesday's Dáil chaos reveals the limits of Executive power. This is the Gist. The election campaign ended with the public's vote but only now do we have a Government. This is the final Campaign Gist. The last of the holiday pieces before normal service is resumed is a short story I wrote when I was 20. This is the New Year's Gist. Horror film director, Paul Duane, gives us a Christmas ghost story haunted by the stuff of childhood memory. This is the Guest Gist. News, Data policy, law and the absurdity of life.

Title: Uber: Growth At A Reasonable Price With Ackman Backing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/02/20/uber-growth-at-a-reasonable-price-with-ackman-backing/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:44:11Z

By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period. While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock. Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects. Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue. The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive. Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S. Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call: Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively. Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force. While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment. Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses. Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share. The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options. Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future. Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.

Our editors carefully select every product we recommend. We may earn a commission from these links. Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Feb 17, 2025 By: Ethan Brehm, Tim Huber and Sean Tirman Published: Feb 17, 2025 Even if you live a pretty minimalist lifestyle, there’s still a pretty good chance that there’s a set of gear that you need to get you through each and every day — especially if you commute to and from your place of work. As such, you probably also need something in which you can haul that gear, both to keep it all organized and safe in your travels. In that case, you’re going to want a work bag to make that commute with you day-in and day-out. And while there’s not a single bag that works for everyone, there are a number of options that are handsome and tough enough to survive the daily grind of all styles — be they a backpack, messenger bag, briefcase, or otherwise. We’ve gone through the trouble of testing our favorites in this guide to the best work bags for men. Whatever your work life, there’s something here for you. Best Minimalist Bag Timbuk2 Commute Messenger Bag 2.0 Best For Cyclists Chrome Industries Citizen Messenger Bag Best Gym-To-Office Bag Aer Duffel Pack 3 Best Rugged Briefcase Filson Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase Best Heirloom Briefcase Satchel & Page Aviator Brief Best Backpack Mission Workshop Rhake VX Best Premium Briefcase Carl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase Article OverviewBest Work Bags BreakdownHow We TestedWhat to Look ForTimbuk2 Commute Messenger Bag 2.0Chrome Industries Citizen Messenger BagAer Duffel Pack 3Filson Tin Cloth Compact BriefcaseSatchel & Page Aviator BriefMission Workshop Rhake VXCarl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather BriefcaseWork Bags Comparison ChartBriefcases vs. messenger Bags Vs. BackpacksHonorable MentionsTested: The Best Work Backpacks to Carry Daily Article Overview With work bags coming in the form of briefcases, backpacks, and messenger bags, it can sometimes be a bit intimidating knowing what to look for when shopping. Fortunately, regardless as to which style of bag, all three carry solutions share a host of traits and properties that should be taken into account. For our guide, we wanted to represent the three major categories of work bags while also paying attention to usage and purpose (e.g., cycling, gym-to-office, white collar settings). We looked at some of our favorite bag brands and some up-and-comers, paying attention to capacity, construction, materials, aesthetic, laptop sleeve and storage, and price. Once we sourced our units for testing, we spent considerable amounts of hands-on time with each briefcase, messenger bag, and backpack, whittling the list down to a select few that really stood out. We really focused on the practicality of using each bag and how it looked and felt doing so. Our results are detailed below. Primary Construction: The material used to construct a work bag’s shell is of monumental importance, as this one single factor plays an enormous role in determining a bag’s overall quality and durability — making this an absolutely essential area to review when shopping. Modern work bags feature shells that are cut from a wide variety of constructions ranging from old-school leather and canvas models to more contemporary bags crafted from CORDURA, sailcloth, or other modern materials. Secondary Materials: Though admittedly not as important as a bag’s shell material, you’ll still want too explore secondary constructions as these also play a major role in a bag’s overall quality and user experience. Secondary materials to review include a bag’s liner material, back pad, shoulder or crossbody straps, and any other grab handles or attachment points. Hardware: One area that separates the more premium bags on the market from their cheaper counterparts is the hardware that they employ. As such, when shopping for a work bag, you’ll want to review the types of zippers being used, as well as any present buckles or other hardware. Build Quality & Craftsmanship: It’s not just a bag’s material selection that plays a role in its overall quality, but also how those materials have been pieced together that matter. As such, you’ll want to review the construction technique or techniques used to make a bag. What’s more, it’s also worth exploring the brand behind each bag, as smaller more boutique outfits almost always exhibit much better craftsmanship compared to companies mass-producing their bags. Size & Volume: A work bag’s size and volume is also of major importance, as this will directly determine how much gear it can carry, as well as other factors such as weight. We recommend considering the supplies, tech, and other essentials that you plan on regularly commuting with, as this should help you determine what size bag you’ll need in order to comfortable accommodate all of your daily kit. Tech Storage: Technology and devices continue to increasingly permeate almost every aspect of our lives — making tech storage an area of monumental importance to consider when shopping. When reviewing this factor, you’ll want to look into whether or not a bag has a laptop sleeve, and if it does, what size it is, if it’s padded, and if it’s suspended or equipped with a false bottom. We also recommend looking out for organizational features for housing cables, cords, wireless mice, chargers, and other tech peripherals. There are also some bags on the market that feature storage for a laptop and a supplementary tablet — or a second notebook. Organizational Amenities: Alongside storage for tech, modern work bags usually feature a wealth of additional organizational amenities geared towards modern workers, such as pen slips, compartments for files and documents, key fob leashes, and water bottle pockets. Style: Whether you fancy an unmistakably vintage-inspired bag or have more of a proclivity for modern models, the huge diversity of options on the market practically ensure that there will be a work bag out there that will personally resonate with you — making style another crucial area to consider when shopping. Best Minimalist Bag: The messenger bag, especially more modernized and up-to-date versions, are one of the best bag styles for modern men who are frequently on-the-go. And Timbuk2’s Commute 2.0 is an especially hard-working bag that goes perfectly with a lifestyle marked by hustle and bustle. It holds up to 19L of gear, weighs just 2.8 pounds, fits up to a 15″ laptop, has a water-resistant exterior, and has plenty of internal and external pouches and compartments for all your storage needs — including a water bottle pocket. Best of all, this bag is backed by Timbuk2’s lifetime warranty. In a world where bags are getting increasingly more nuanced, there’s still room for simplicity. While the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 isn’t barebones, it’s certainly straightforward, with basic pocket structure, including two large primary pockets, the front-most having smaller compartments for organizing. However, don’t expect this to be super specialized. On the other hand, the exterior has its fair share of zippered pockets if you do happen to bring along some smaller gear. This includes two underneath the folding lid, which also has two Velcro straps for carrying something like an umbrella or tripod. On the shoulder, the Commute wears very comfortably with its padded strap, while the attachable stabilizer strap might help when cycling, or for days when you’ve simply brought along more than you can handle. I appreciated the webbed lid, which helped keep out the light drizzles I was experiencing during testing. Likewise, the buckles came on and off very easily, but never too easily. At well under $200, the messenger bag is a perfect option for those on a budget, perhaps college students working a summer internship. However, this is definitely a solid pick even if you don’t want all the bells and whistles of a more technical bag. My biggest complaint with the Commute 2.0 is the small size of the water bottle compartment. I carry a larger 32-ounce thermos but it wasn’t fitting inside this pouch. Also, even though it wasn’t our experience during testing, the laptop compartment, while sturdy enough, isn’t suspended at the bottom, which might be an issue if you set this down too hard. However, the bottom of the bag is luckily reinforced very well so that this might not be an issue at all. Verdict: While not the most robust bag in the world, the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 is still plenty sturdy with its reinforced bottom and water-resistant shell. We loved the straightforward design that doesn’t give you too much, albeit still presenting plenty of pocket options. The water bottle compartment is a bit too small and the laptop sleeve makes us a bit nervous but we didn’t run into any problems in the field. For just $170 or less, this messenger bag will be the perfect choice for lots of buyers. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: Recycled Nylon Volume: 19L Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best For Cyclists: Chrome Industries first released its game-changing Citizen Messenger Bag back in 1995, and though nearly three decades have passed since that time, the Citizen remains one of the best messenger bags — and best choice for cyclists — on the market. Cut from 1,050-denier nylon — or laminated sailcloth — Chrome Industries’ Citizen Messenger Bag is a 24-liter vessel that features a fully waterproof floating TPE bucket liner that includes separate wet and dry compartments, while also featuring reflective detailing which is great for night riding. Inside, the bag also features a laptop sleeve capable of storing 15” notebooks, while the outside features a crossbody strap equipped with one of Chrome’s signature seatbelt-style quick-release buckles — the latter of which bolsters the bag’s style and character as well as functionality. Recognizing that not every work bag has to be tailored towards the office worker, the Citizen Messenger Bag is a deceptively spacious messenger bag that’s cleverly designed. While bottle sleeves are typically held on the outside of bags, I particularly love the interior side pockets for both a water bottle and umbrella. As for the dedicated laptop sleeve, it won’t look or feel as secure as the ones on your typical laptop bags but it’s certainly more weatherproof. First, you benefit from the sailcloth exterior, then the top of this hidden compartment is sealed with ultra-strong Velcro. Chrome still leaves room on the outside for your pens and pencils with dedicated compartments. Also, if you’re traveling a long distance with the Citizen bag, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s very comfortable around the shoulder and neck area. As I mentioned, the laptop sleeve here isn’t necessarily as great as some others. It’s very unstructured and isn’t padded. However, I opted to bring my own separate sleeve and put that in the dedicated compartment instead, still benefiting from the weatherproofing built in. Also, the main compartment is very large. This thing maxes out at 28L, which can be great if you’re the type of person who wants a catch-all for all your day’s gear. After all, if you’re biking to and from work, there’s a good chance you’ll want to stock up with everything you’ll need throughout the day; this thing can easily double as a work-to-gym bag as well. However, this will be too big for many users. Lastly, while the buckles are highly sturdy, they can be a bit tough to open when you’re in a hurry, especially one-handed –– but at least it closes quickly, which is unarguably more important. Verdict: Large and in charge, the Citizen Messenger Bag from Chrome was a game-changer when it came out in the ’90s and is still just as inventive today. We loved the thoughtful features like the interior bottle compartments and the heavy-duty Velcro to supplement the weatherproof sailcloth shell. While 28L may be a bit much for many workers, this cycling bag will more than carry your day’s worth of work gear, and then some, and is very comfortable to wear on longer journeys. If you’re looking for a laptop messenger bag, you may want to try something else but this is nevertheless a fantastic, fairly priced option for urban commuters. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: 1,050D Nylon (or Laminated Sailcloth) Volume: 24L (or 28L) Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Gym-To-Office Bag: Not everyone is going to need a convertible bag that can haul up to 21.4L worth of gear. But for those who do, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Aer Duffel Pack 3. Not only is this minimalist third-gen bag beautifully-designed, but it’s got an exterior crafted from insanely-rugged water-resistant 1,680-denier CORDURA ballistic nylon, a huge variety of organizational compartments — including a ventilated shoe compartment if you need to swap your commuter sneakers for a nice pair of dress shoes — heavy-duty hardware, a 16-inch laptop pouch, and so much more. Add to that Aer’s signature brand of sleek minimalist aesthetics, and you’ve got one of the best work backpacks that money can buy. And when you’re not using it for work, this bag makes an absolutely superb travel pack or gym bag, as well. You wouldn’t be wrong to feel like this backpack-meets-duffel bag from Aer is your favorite of the bunch, whether or not you’re actually going into the office. The real selling point of the Duffel Pack 3 is its versatility. Of any bag here, this one is the most favorable for transitioning to weekend outings or traveling. Like all of Aer’s backpacks, the shoulder straps here are very comfortable, especially throughout a long day, and with lots of gear in this 21.4-liter bag. Multiple grab handles helps with its carry-on status, as well as attaching to another bag perhaps, or vice versa. Seemingly every place that could potentially house a compartment does house a compartment, and without adding bulk. For instance, there’s a sort of pleated design on the front of the bag, which gives the bag its stylish design language but also adds two large but tight water bottle pockets (one on either side), as well as small, hidden zippered pockets up top. There’s also a zippered pocket in the top of the bag, as well as a drainable shoe pouch at the bottom. Also, the main laptop compartment is a star on its own, with tons of room for extra cables, chargers, and stationary, etc. And the laptop sleeve is suspended, helping it remain protected from drops and the like. My favorite element is the large compartment in front, which features water-resistant zippers that are easy to open. And when I say, “zippers,” I’m referring to two of them. This is ever helpful when it is actually raining and you need to access the interior. When there’s only one zipper, you run the risk of having to open the entire bag if the item you’re looking for is on the other side. Two zippers, however, minimizes water ingress. Also, this compartment has a flex pouch on the inside. But the clever part is that Aer uses the flap that hangs down from the top exterior pocket twofold, allowing it to double as extra coverage over the opening of the flex pocket, bolstering the water-resistance even further. Admittedly, there’s not much to complain about with the Aer Duffel Pack 3. It’s my favorite bag on this list, and not just because I’m partial to backpacks. The price point is also perfect, comfortably under $200. I would, however, love if there were a way to remove the backpack straps and easily add a more traditional duffel strap to the front. On the other hand, this might affect the visual appeal of the Duffel Pack while also eliminating its versatility. Also, as much as I loved the shoe compartment for my low-top shoes (size 12.5), it didn’t fit my high-tops, which I use for playing basketball at the gym. Verdict: Arguably the coolest and most unique bag on this list, the Aer Duffel Pack 3 is a fairly priced backpack that makes complete use of every square inch without adding any bulk. The pockets and compartments are so thoughtfully designed but aren’t too complicated. Large water bottle pockets, a dedicated shoe compartment, and a water-resistant duffel compartment are just bonuses to the well-structured and suspended laptop pocket. Whether you’re going from office-to-gym, traveling for the weekend, or just going about your day with some gear on your back, this is a fantastic choice. Type: Backpack with duffel features Primary Construction: 1,680D CORDURA Volume: 21.4L Weight: 2.9LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Rugged Briefcase: While Filson is best known for their rugged, heritage-focused gear with a focus on the outdoors, their refined design language unsurprisingly has also paired beautifully into a range of office-friendly gear, as well. Eschewing the standard work bag “look,” their Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is built with British Millerain’s famed waxed cotton, woven tightly by Filson for abrasion resistance. However, it’s outfitted with a padded 15-inch laptop sleeve, bridle leather handles, and removable shoulder strap for better office friendliness. There’s also a large front stow pocket for papers and folders, a durable YKK zipper, and 9L of space. Filson has several briefcase options that are all worthy of contention. We also liked the Dryden, which is unfortunately no longer available. However, the versatility and ruggedness of this heritage-inspired Tin Cloth bag made it a great choice as well. If you’re looking for a simple, non-cumbersome way to transport your laptop and a few extras into work, then the Filson Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase will be a nice pick. It only holds 9L but that should be perfectly fine for many workers. Also, if you’ve ever owned a Filson bag, you’ll know what to expect in terms of style. The Tin Cloth has a beautifully rugged aesthetic that might not necessarily fit the office milieu in some instances, but can be the perfect outlet for expression in others. As for the laptop compartment, some users will notice that it’s not necessarily as sturdy as some others on this list. However, Filson does give it slight supsension to prevent your laptop from just resting at the bottom of the bag. The briefcase also has quite a wide bottom that actually allows it to stand up on its own with its EVA foam bottom, even with stuff inside. However, I have a MacBook Air, which is very lightweight; I can’t speak to this effect with a heavier laptop. I also appreciated how the Tin Cloth briefcase didn’t smell like waxed cotton canvas can often smell like, especially when it’s been treated with oil like this one has. As I said, the rugged design won’t be for everyone, but this is hardly a point of contention since the bag at no point hides its primary aesthetic. In terms of actual critiques, my main quibbles are with the carrying options. The detachable shoulder strap isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, and could certainly use some sort of padding for the neck area. However, it’s not offensively uncomfortable either, especially considering this briefcase doesn’t hold that much gear. Likewise, the leather handles could also use some sort of padding. I found my hands getting fatigued after just 20 minutes of carrying this. I should also mention that the price here will feel a bit steep for many buyers wondering why a small, simple, 9-liter briefcase costs over $350. While this is to be expected from a heritage brand like Filson and can be justified with their construction methods and durability, I see how it can turn some people off. Verdict: As rugged as you’d expect from Filson, the Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is a simple, small, and durable briefcase that can effectively carry your laptop without many issues; the laptop sleeve is even suspended and the bag can stand up on its own in most instances. We didn’t love the carrying handles and thought they could use some sort of padding for comfort. Likewise, many will be turned off by the steep price tag here. However, this is an awesome, straightforward work bag for those who are fans of Filson’s distinct, heritage-inspired design ethos. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: British Millerain waxed cotton canvas with EVA foam base Volume: 9L Weight: 2.6LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Heirloom Briefcase: Few companies know how to make heirloom-quality bags at reasonable prices. However, while Satchel & Page strikes a balance between affordable and premium price tag, its bags are anything but cheap. Inspired by a World War II-era map bag owned by its founder’s grandfather, the Dallas-based company sources his waterproof 20oz waxed leather canvas from a third-generation family tannery in Italy and manufactures its products in Europe. And it’s that amalgamation of regions that makes products such as their Aviator Brief so special. Made for office workers, the Aviator Brief has a rugged personality but is trimmed handsomely with French cowhide shoulders and given antique brass hardware. Inside, the padded laptop holds up to a 16-inch laptop and has plenty of pockets for organization. From first sight, the Aviator Brief was the most eye-catching of the bunch. Satchel & Page’s aesthetic is very distinct, bringing a sort of stylish simplicity to each piece that I can only describe as “nuanced minimalism.” Like the Filson above, the military-inspired green canvas isn’t the most office-ready but at least the S&P bag has plenty of features to serve its main purpose. Aside from the interior laptop sleeve, which is slightly suspended and situated towards the middle of the bag to keep it away from the sides, the inside has a larger zippered pocket, a few wider pouches, and purpose-built features for items like business cards a writing utensils. Each of the exterior sides has its own large zippered pocket. Also, this bag can stand up on its own thanks to the beefy boot at the bottom. I especially loved the attachable luggage pass-through buckle that threads through outside leather straps, making this a great travel option as well. And best of all, it makes a point to only thread through the side closest to the laptop. This is so that, if the bag falls, it will create a buffer between the ground and your computer. Likewise, the attachable shoulder strap is pretty comfortable on the neck thanks to the adjustable padding. There’s not statement from the brand on the exact capacity of the bag but estimates seem to put this at about 12L or more. From the look of the Aviator Brief to its meticulously designed interior, it doesn’t have a lot of downsides. Even the price, which is relatively similar to the Filson Tin Cloth briefcase, feels more appropriate here for all that you get. However, my biggest issue is the dry weight of the S&P briefcase. Although it’s listed at 3lbs, it feels a bit heavier than that. And seeing that you can fit quite a lot inside, this weight will only get higher. Of course, the high weight is also due to the thickness and density of the canvas and leather materials, which is also a good thing considering it’s housing your laptop and tech. As a minor complaint, the top handles don’t fall flat against the sides when this thing is idle. However, it seems like over time they could break in enough to bend the leather a bit more. Verdict: Arguably the best-looking bag on this list, the Aviator Brief takes Satchel & Page’s design language and transposes it for an office-ready briefcase, equipped with lots of meticulously-designed interior compartments and a laptop sleeve made to prevent any damage caused to your computer. We felt the bag was fairly priced for everything you get. However, we couldn’t help but notice how much heavier it is compared to other briefcases –– but this is just evident of how sturdy the construction is. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Waxed canvas from full-grain French cowhide shoulders Volume: Unspecified Weight: 3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Backpack: Whether your place of work is just down the street, across town, or on the other side of the country, the Mission Workshop Rhake laptop backpack is undoubtedly a superb work bag for you. This particular version is made from ultra-tough, weatherproof VX-21 fabric — available in three striking colorways — and it can hold up to 22L of gear. It’s also compatible with the brand’s modular Arkiv system via dual exterior integrated rails. And the rolltop closure ensures that all your stuff will stay nice and dry, even if you’re riding your bicycle through a downpour. Aside from the 17-inch laptop compartment, there’s a 10-inch pocket for smaller devices around 10″. Admittedly, the Mission Workshop Rhake is a sight to behold, from both technical and aesthetic perspectives. It’s obvious that the folks behind the backpack have utilized their own real-world knowledge and experience when designing the pack. While the pack has a plethora of compartments, they’re built for organization and are incredibly easy to access and sort through. It can be a pain to rummage through your backpack to find a single item but the meticulous and thoughtful design streamlined this process every time. I loved the large zippered laptop pocket inside, which is unassuming and difficult enough to access for any potential thieves. Likewise, the polyester lining inside creates a barrier between the main pocket and the laptop sleeve –– which is suspended for protection. Utilizing both inside and outside space, the bag sports a large primary rolltop compartment that’s adjustable in size and is perfect for storing bulkier items like a jacket or a lunch box. However, my favorite feature might be the set of buckles below the closure that secures a couple of zippered fold-out pockets. These, as well as the horizontally-running zippered pocket on the front face, are perfect for EDC or tech storage. Each element of the backpack serves a distinct purpose for either convenience or utility. I should also point out how comfortable the shoulder straps are and how easy they are to adjust. At $545, the Rhake is obviously not for the faint of heart. Perhaps a bit too much for some office workers, the backpack will intimidate with the same features that make it so great. However, considering all the features it had, I did wish there was a sort of water bottle pouch. Fortunately, there are enough attachment points that I was able to latch it on with a carabiner (this will only work if you have a closed-handle bottle). I also must mention that the sternum strap doesn’t adjust very far. In fact, I almost couldn’t buckle it in the center when it was loosened all the way –– this might be an issue for broader individuals. Verdict: Utilizing every inch of the backpack, Mission Workshop has outdone itself with the Rhake. Perhaps a bit intimidating for some, this highly-capable technical pack is purpose-built for carrying a laptop to the office (or anywhere, really) and doing so protected from the elements thanks to the weatherproof X-Pac shell. We loved the unique arrangement of tech and EDC storage on the outside, which is easy to access. However, we do know the price will be a bit steep for many buyers. Nevertheless, the Rhake is one of our favorites for a reason. Check out our in-depth Mission Workshop Rhake review here. Type: Backpack Primary Construction: X-Pac VX-21 Volume: 22L Weight: 3.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 17″ Best Premium Briefcase: If the two canvas briefcases above are too heritage-inspired for you, check out the Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase from Carl Friedrik, an uber-classy white-collar option with a modern look. Holding 10L of gear, it’s available in both smooth and grained vegetable-tanned Italian vachetta leather with nylon lining inside and custom nickel-plated hardware. The dedicated laptop sleeve fits models up to 15″ while the fabric shoulder strap is very soft and easy to stow. At $745, the Palissy is quite the investment but will certainly complement a suit and tie with ease. In the past year or so, we’ve really grown to love Carl Friedrik’s design language, with its minimalist simplicity and touches of almost Deco-inspired lines. We went with the smooth leather option as well, for its flatter appearance. As a side note, the bag exudes a beautiful leather aroma. On the inside, the laptop compartment has an interesting open design, where the top half is exposed. Perhaps controversial, this feature does make access a breeze. If I’m running late for a meeting, it removes an extra step in my setup. There aren’t a ton of extra features inside but there are pockets for pens and business cards, as well as both small- and medium-sized pouches for other tech gear. There’s one compartment on the outside but I’m honestly not sure what it’s for; it’s way too tight to put most things inside. While the bag weighs 3.3lbs, it feels very lightweight. Even if you pack it full, the top handles are comfortable for longer stints of carrying it and the lightweight fabric shoulder strap is really comfortable on the neck. Obviously, $745 is a lot to spend on a briefcase but this is aimed at white collar workers with a higher budget, and will certainly appeal to that crowd. While I loved the open design to the laptop compartment for its easy access, I couldn’t help but feel like it was going to come out in transit (it never did). However, my bigger concern is the lack of suspension with this sleeve, which would prevent any unfortunate damage caused by repeated drops of this bag. On the other hand, Carl Friedrik has put metal feet on the bottom of the bag for separation, so that’s a plus. Verdict: Designed for a white-collar environment, the Carl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase is a handsome, classy bag that’s light in weight. Instantly stunning on a visual level, the bag also has useful interior elements like pen pockets and an laptop sleeve that’s partially exposed for easy access –– a feature that might be controversial for some. At $745, this won’t be for everyone but it’s the perfect briefcase for those who can afford it. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Italian vachetta leather Volume: 10L Weight: 3.3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15″ Briefcases: Boasting a dignified and elegant air, briefcases are a traditional style of work bags that have been sized to carry laptops, documents, and other notebook-sized office essentials. Not unlike messenger bags, briefcases typically sport a low-profile, rectangular shape that comes equipped with a shoulder strap for easy carrying. With briefcases admittedly lack the storage space and organizational amenities of backpacks and larger messenger bags, they can still make for fantastic carry solutions for work, being able to accommodate your daily essentials — and typically not much else. Messenger Bags: Traditionally worn by bicycle messengers, messenger bags are a modern type of carry solution that borrows traits from briefcases, slings, and backpacks. Designed to be worn over the shoulder or across the back, messenger bags can range from compact, simple, and streamlined models to larger, more elaborate vessels brimming with storage space and organizational amenities. And, while these bags obviously still immensely conducive to cycling — and motorcycling — they still make for stellar work bags for those who commute by car, train, or on foot. Backpacks: Backpacks have long been the most popular type of daily carry solution — and for good reason. These storage and carrying solutions offer a generous amount of storage space and an equally robust array of organizational features. A more evolved take on the book bags you likely used in your youth, these bags can hugely differ in terms of style and aesthetics, practically guaranteeing that there’s a backpack out there that will jive with your personal taste. Bellroy does a great job with its minimalist, straightforward items, from wallets to backpacks. We do really like their Tokyo Work Bag as well but just couldn’t justify selecting this messenger bag over our favorites above. Known for resurrecting an old shoe polish company and turning into a modern-day watch brand with vintage Americana aesthetics, Shinola has expanded beyond mere watchmaking with an array of items for both office and lifestyle spaces. So is true with the Runwell Messenger Bag, a classy option, albeit one with a steep $900 price tag. KILLSPENCER is a great brand who does a nice job with its leather bags. However, at $1,500, this Esquire Briefcase is really nice but we couldn’t justify it for the price and considering we already had some solid leather picks above, and for less money. We really love the work that Tom Bihn does with its luggage and bags, and this Tri-Star messenger bag is no different with its unique compartment layout and durability. However, we simply couldn’t get our hands on a unit for testing this time around. Mystery Ranch does some great job if you’re into outdoor tactical bags, and make work bags as well such as this 3 Way Expandable Briefcase. However, we felt the more office-focused approach was better for this guide. Rickshaw makes a Reddit-favorite work bag called the Medium Zero Messenger but we weren’t necessarily blown away by it.
