The company’s fate will reveal how strong the foundation of Elon Musk’s influence really is. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 4:52 p.m. on February 12, 2025 Donald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company’s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call—not least that in 2024, Tesla’s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon. Instead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla’s path to being “worth more than the next top five companies combined.” This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars—a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins—was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.) Musk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because—despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans—he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk’s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there. Musk needs that belief to hold. Tesla’s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla’s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter. For all of Musk’s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its “money-losing start-up” phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla’s market share is China’s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did. Yet that competition can’t entirely account for Tesla’s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla’s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge. Musk’s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla’s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company’s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk’s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk’s Sieg heil–ish arm gesture at Trump’s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can’t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla—many from longtime Tesla owners who say they’re ready to move on. In theory, Musk’s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it’s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn’t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he’s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs. Nor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about “more affordable” new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company’s “unsupervised” robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he’s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking—which he’s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years—is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks. In the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” technology and its claims about the technology’s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations. Tesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California’s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk’s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America’s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up—especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla. Musk’s approach to Tesla’s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla’s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google’s Waymo. Musk’s Tesla faces the rising threat of China’s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD’s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they’re noticing where Musk’s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla’s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains. The most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who’s to say anyone will buy what they’re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can’t do that—or at least keep convincing investors that he’ll be able to—he’s just another guy screaming online.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Lyft shares slumped about 9 per cent on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company warned that lower pricing trends from late last year are expected to continue in 2025, as it tries to match prices with larger rival Uber. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers and drivers onto its platform by keeping prices competitive and launching new features that differentiate it from Uber. However, Lyft said on Tuesday that it saw prices fall in the fourth quarter and the trend has continued so far this year. It added that the company had to drop fares for rides and give away more coupons in the last few weeks of 2024 to keep prices competitive. In contrast, Uber said last week that it expects prices for its affordable private car offering, UberX, to be marginally up this year, as it passes insurance cost hikes on to consumers. "What seems clear though is U.S. rideshare is allocating more incentive dollars towards consumers, funded by lower incentives to drivers — ok 'if' done with balance," Bernstein analysts said in a note. Lyft said it had the flexibility to adjust incentives to balance supply and demand in the marketplace since it had a robust number of drivers on the platform. "We suspect prices will be lower for longer which will test the elasticity of demand for the industry," Needham analysts said. At least thirteen brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings below Wall Street estimates, similar to rival Uber's projection last week. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.4, compared to Uber's 29.4. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.9 per cent, while so far this year it has risen 11.6 per cent. Its market capitalization was set to fall by more than $500 million to roughly $5.4 billion, if losses hold. Uber's shares were about 3 per cent lower on Wednesday.

Title: How Tariffs Make CFOs’ Jobs More Complex

Plus: Consumers Feel Economic Change Slowly, Planned Aluminum And Steel Tariffs Rile Allies, Vought Uses OMB To Halt CFPB, Tech Companies Invest In AI Infrastructure There’s been a huge amount of change in the last month, and from an economic standpoint, it seems to be hitting consumers slowly, but surely. Job growth is stuck, prices don’t seem to be going anywhere, and many feel they are financially worse off than a year ago. January’s jobs data from the Labor Department, released last week, significantly missed growth projections and signified the weakest start to a year in terms of new jobs since 2016. Economists were expecting 170,000 new jobs, but the report showed the addition of just 143,000. And the expectation of job losses is growing. In the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released this week, 14.2% of people feel a probability of losing their jobs in the next 12 months, up 2.3% from December. About a third of consumers said their household financial situation is worse off than a year ago, the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. And while this is down slightly month-over-month, only about 19% say they are doing better than a year ago—a 3% decrease from December. Over a fifth aren’t optimistic about the economy and say they will be doing worse a year from now. January’s Consumer Confidence Index, reported two weeks ago, showed a 5.4-point decline from December. The data shows some optimism. Labor Department data showed record-high average hourly wages of $35.87, as well as an unemployment rate of 4%, down from 4.1% in December. And 36.6% feel their household finances will be better a year from now, according to the Survey of Consumer Expectations. However, there’s lots of room for improvement. Two-thirds of Americans feel that President Donald Trump administration’s policy focus so far isn’t doing enough to lower prices, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll last week. The next round of consumer price index numbers come out this week, which will show just how much prices are changing—though the consumer expectations survey shows that Americans anticipate price increases for food, gas, rent and medical care. CFOs are increasingly having issues with making projections since so many companies rely on imports, and so many different tariff threats are being quickly proposed, rescinded and taking effect. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement of cash management software platform Kyriba, about how CFOs can plan in today’s circumstances. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Workers in Camden, N.J. use a crane to load a 60,000 pound coil of steel onto a railroad car. President Donald Trump signed another round of tariffs this week: 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. “This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the tariff orders in the Oval Office, CBS News reported. This is a familiar policy to Trump, who assessed tariffs on steel and aluminum in his first term to bolster domestic industry. Those tariffs—25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports—had several exemptions, and ended up bringing the biggest benefit to steel companies, according to a 2018 analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Allies from the EU and Australia spoke out about the planned tariffs, which are reported to go into effect next month, saying that they will harm U.S. consumers and long-established partnerships. The U.S. imports about a quarter of all of the steel it uses, and about half of the aluminum, Reuters reports. Most of the steel the U.S. imports comes from Canada, Brazil and Mexico, while the lion’s share of aluminum imports come from Canada. Several analysts have said these new tariffs will have limited benefit to the U.S.—likely just for the steel companies—and will not likely create jobs. They are also likely to raise prices for most things made from metal. Even the United Steelworkers International Union feels the tariff proposal goes too far, and wrote the U.S. needs to take a more measured approach, distinguishing trusted trade partners. The move caused significant shifts in the stock market, boosting prices of domestic metals companies, including Alcoa and U.S. Steel. It also boosted gold prices to a record high of $2,938 per troy ounce, as investors search for stability. This isn’t the only move on tariffs in the last week. Trump announced during a Friday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week—tariffs equal to what other countries impose on U.S. goods. There’s no word yet on how those might work. Russell Vought at a confirmation hearing in January in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russell Vought as the head of the Office of Management and Budget with a vote along party lines. Vought, founder of the prominent right-wing Center for Renewing America and key adviser to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025, was considered one of Trump’s more controversial nominees because of his viewpoint of expansive executive branch control on spending. One of his first big moves is essentially halting all work of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, taking its website offline and telling workers not come in and stop work activities. The CFPB was created in 2011 following the Great Recession and financial crisis. It’s an agency that protects consumers from unfair banking practices, but it also has deep-pocketed enemies. Elon Musk, who has been working with his Department of Government Efficiency task force to mercilessly cut perceived wasteful spending, has railed against CFPB because “there are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” He said this in November, shortly after the agency announced more oversight of big tech companies and others offering digital funds transfers and payment wallet apps. Meta founder and CEO and billionaire Marc Andreessen also have spoken out against the agency, which has threatened action against tech companies’ use of financial data. Rendering of Meta's Sucre data center in Louisiana. AI evangelists say the technology can do a lot for companies, but to continue to grow—both revenues for companies and capabilities for users—some infrastructure investments are needed. Big companies are announcing bigger AI data center projects, with bigger budgets and footprints. Forbes’ Christopher Helman runs down many of these plans, which include not only huge facilities like Meta’s $10 billion planned Sucré data center in Louisiana—covering 4 million square feet of floor space on 2,250 acres—but enough infrastructure to power it all—$3.2 billion worth for Meta, coming from twin high-efficiency natural gas turbines. In all, Meta plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on these data centers in the next year. Meta’s not alone in these investments. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, announced on last week’s earnings call that the next year will see about $75 billion in capital expenditures for technical infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that in the last quarter Google hit capacity issues with its cloud and services business, which constrained its growth. Microsoft is planning to invest $80 billion in data centers. And through a partnership announced from the White House between SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI called “Stargate,” SoftBank will invest $500 billion in U.S. data centers during the next four years. Kyriba Global Head of Enablement Bob Stark and the Port of Los Angeles. Economic predictions were challenging for CFOs before Trump’s second presidency began, but announcements of potential tariffs on different countries and industries, and along a variety of timelines, add a lot more uncertainty to the future. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement at cash management software platform Kyriba about what CFOs are going through and what they can do to prepare for the short- and long-term future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. Tariffs were also a feature of President Trump’s first term. How similar is what’s happening right now to then? Stark: You look at what was announced around steel and aluminum, and that feels very similar to what we saw in the previous term. That said, I think the differences—and our clients had the same reaction: the blanket tariffs, the punitive tariffs, if you tariff us, then we’ll tariff you back and it’s sort of back and forth—feel a little bit more significant than what we had experienced previously. It certainly feels like an acceleration. CFOs and finance teams are definitely looking at that as a lot of different potential scenarios that you have to prepare for. It’s not as simple as: This industry is affected [with a] 25% hit, so if you’re a Canadian steel exporter, you have this problem—which is fairly predictable. You can figure what 25% looks like. Same with importers on the U.S. side. [They’re] just trying to understand what does our cost look like? They can map out demand, but it’s the back and forth and the uncertainty around that. It’s difficult to predict exactly when impacts will be felt, which is a big challenge for CFOs. Many of them are looking to provide updates to guidance quarterly. In this quarter, do we have a cashflow impact that we need to control? Do we have a liquidity challenge where we need to make some plans? Do we need to provide different or maybe more expansive hedging of FX [foreign currency exchange] because we recognize that it’s these short and sharp movements that can have a significant impact in the balance sheet and income statement reporting at the end of the quarter. There’s a lot. It’s the uncertainty of what is the actual impact. There’s so many more scenarios you have to play out in different ways that feel different than what we saw several years back when we first saw this idea of tariffs being proposed and implemented. This time around, it feels to me like some of the tariffs that are being threatened and announced are more unexpected. Is that your impression? Absolutely. It feels to a corporate CFO that there’s a daily news cycle that you have to invest more time in following. You have to then build that into your analysis and reporting. If you’re doing something as simple as: What is the impact of cashflow if this blanket tariff goes in. What’s the difference? It’s being delayed by 30 days. What does that mean? There’s a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability around that. That’s the biggest challenge for CFOs. It’s like playing that hand game with your kids. You put one down, then there’s another, and then there’s another, and then there’s another. And then suddenly you think, ‘Wow, where did this go?’ That’s the part that’s really difficult to predict and build into an analysis. When the CEO is calling you because they just saw this on CNBC, and they’re asking the question: What’s the impact on our cash flow? Do we need to change our guidance? You have to juggle not just one or two different possibilities, but [there’s] probably three or four different scenarios you need to model against the same data, and then you have to be in a position to answer with precision on demand. And, ‘I’ll get back to you tomorrow’ is not an acceptable response. It’s ‘I’ll tell you right now, if these tariffs go through, this is what the impact is. If they’re delayed out 30 days, if they’re delayed out six months…’ Those are the scenarios that you have to be able to report to the board with confidence so that everyone's prepared. How do you think a company can make its way through the next four years? There’s three things that CFOs can do, aside from watching all the news and being able to utilize AI to summarize the things that they can’t watch live. Once they’re armed with that insight and understanding of sentiment, they’re in a position to do three things. Number one: FX. Those sharp, short-term movements can be the difference between hitting and missing guidance. Every CFO has to be able to quantify the impact of currency on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. If they’re not in a position to do that, then it erodes confidence a little bit. No one wants choppiness. They want certainty, and they want at least three months—ideally more—in advance. If you can eradicate the impact of FX, or mute it significantly, you’re in a better position than many of your peers. Number two: forecasting and planning. Every time there’s impactful news, CFOs need to answer: What would this mean to our cash and liquidity in the future? Finance leaders, they must have precise answers. They have to have them at the ready. They have to be available for multiple scenarios so that hypothetically speaking, they can answer a question like this: Our cash flow decreases by 30% if this tariff actually happens in the next 20 days. You need to be able to answer the question with that level of precision. That CEO and the board, they’re not waiting an hour. They’re probably not waiting five minutes either. They expect data and insights right now. The third part: Getting control over the cash lifecycle. CFOs need to be able to pull multiple levers to maintain control of their cash, especially in response to customers wanting to bring forward orders to get ahead of tariffs. That’s a perfect example of being able to have control, making sure that they can provide the structure, the systems financing to allow changes in the supply chain to occur. Also [to be able to provide control] in response to potential reshoring or recomposition of supply chains. Some of that is a little bit more longer term. That might be later in 2025 or into 2026. We recognize we just can’t compose our supply chain this way. We need to reshore this part of it. We need to eliminate this country out of our supply chain. It just doesn’t work in terms of the cost structure. Whatever that scenario looks like for them, the CFO needs to be able to put in the structure. It’s very tactical. Everything from bank accounts to cash management structures, the ability to sweep the and pool cash and mobilize it wherever it needs to be, to not only invest, but also repatriate cash so you can meet those cashflow objectives of the organization. There’s a lot of complexity there. Nevermind working with supply chains, working with customers to be able to pull the lever of: We’re going to pay you earlier, but it’s going to come at a cost, and as a result, we need to be able to do that. You want to get paid earlier, Mr. and Mrs. Supplier, we’ll do that, but here’s the program to do it. Same thing with accelerating receipt of cash. If you need to accelerate collections, you need a structure with that. It’s not a program that just happens like that. It’s a year in the making to put that structure in with your banks and with your finance and providers.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow.

Time Published: 2025-02-11T05:07:40Z

Not sure why they are so cheap but they are 50% off the already bargain price and it's also possible to schedule a delivery for any day this week. Bear in mind you might be taking a risk of it being out of stock if scheduling for Valentine's Day. Price is $11.04 + $1.99 Delivery Fee + $1.10 Service fee for a total of $14.13. Pink roses are even cheaper, $12.93 for 10 delivered. Tried in a couple of different states and seems to be available everywhere I've checked. $0 Delivery Fee on your First Order. Referrer receives something too (Likely free delivery on next order). Cannot be stacked with new user signup codes. Not in SA. These guys deliver free anywhere. $12.99 delivery fee for me lol Still a bargain if you compare what others are charging. $15.99 delivery for me Couldn't find Harris Farm Markets in Brisbane, QLD - there is one a suburb over, so a little surprised. Oh well. I tried Sydney (city) and Gold Coast (Southport) was the same price. Can't find Clayfield store. Automatically chooses Redfern. Same! Didn't have the pick up option for West End - so I put in Harris Farms as the delivery address with the instructions to meet me out the front of the store. Fingers crossed. I'm in Zillmere and it worked for me (assume it's the Clayfield store). Managed to get 50% a large bouquet ($35 down from $70) and added a block of chocolate to get it over $40 to save an additional $20. Spent less than $25 to get both! Oof, nice. I can't even find this item at the Clayfield store at all, is it still there? How? I'm in North Lakes and can't seem to order - delivery not availabe. Username checks out. Delivered on Valentine’s Day? You can schedule a delivery for then as you can with any Uber Eats delivery. (At your own risk ofc) Thanks OP!! Ordered now let's see if they show up in the next hour as the app says they will!! Don't forget to add an eggplant/cucumber/zucchini for an extra $0.59!!! Does she need something to make up for what you lack?! :) Yes Then just pay $0.59, forgo the flowers. Great deal. You can schedule delivery for Friday (Valentine’s Day). What a win! Scheduled but what are the odds of these being delivered on valentines day! My guess is 'slim' but you never know, Harris Farm have pretty good customer service in my experience. You would hope that they would hold back the stock for delivery for those orders already made. No clue what these roses will look like when or if the come on Friday but worth a gamble! Ps make sure you say refund if out of stock to avoid any replacements at higher prices. Thanks op Any clue where the option/setting is to do this in the UE app? I stumbled onto it at checking my scheduled orders. what these roses will look like Got them delivered a couple hours ago. They looked really nice. Was braced for a lot less. Plain wrap, no extra frills. ( But I only got 9, not 10 ☹️ ). Is it the same price in store? Could go for some mortadella Looks like it's $22 in store, where I checked anyway No love for Melburnians! And no —- either! 40 flowers for $28.60 Thanks OP Time to sell them on the side of a busy road. How did you get $20 off ? This targeted deal Girlfriend is either gonna be really disappointed or really impressed. Either way I can't lose You never loose to GF. You lose when she becomes wife So, always win by staying as her BF ? A win win if you can 😄 @Username Taken: You believe you win; she wins with the lawyers. yeah i thought i was winning when GF became wife but nope lol Do these come wrapped in paper at the stems or how are they sent out. Mine came as a bouquet in paper. Not showing as an available SKU for Harris Farms Chatswood/Willoughby. Might be expired/OOS. On checkout page is states: "promotions are estimates, not guaranteed, and may depend on item and promotion availability in store, you will be charged the in-store price for available items in your cart". Is that mean if schedule on Friday and no 50% off promotion on that day, you will get charge full price? Nothing says I love you more than having an unwashed man with pungent B.O arrive with flowers… This is why you should always use a delivery driver. Or have a shower. $15.99 delivery in Canberra $6.49 for me ($0 as UberOne) for delivery from Harris Majura. You could try pickup? $4 service fee. Free delivery for me since I spent $30. Getting it delivered from Majura Park $17 delivery for me (uber one) Make sure you're ordering from Majura Park Harris Farm lol Yes, indeed I tried a Weston Creek address and a city address and both saying too far. Wth If you're an UberOne member apparently there's no delivery fee. I'm not and the delivery fee is $15.99. Nice - 40 roses delivered for $26.18! (20x Red + 20x Pink, less $20 off $40 spend promo with free delivery for Uber One!). I give this ~10% chance of showing up, but if it does then that's a huge win! Thanks OP! Fingers crossed DD does a repeat of last year's deal with the free flowers from Coles :P $15.49 delivery fee. Does Uber One cover the delivery fee for stores that are farther away? Legend Pink roses are even cheaper OP can't work out why he is single OP made it this year and shared ozb with 50% off 'bedroom ticket'. Ordered. Cancelled… I am single and just ordered a bunch of roses for myself Western Sydney was out of stock and double the price. CBD worked A-OK. Hope they are delivered! Thanks OP Woah nice price. Thanks Tried ordering from a few stores in Sydney and wouldn't let me check out, said I had to cancel my order. Ordered two bunches of 10 long stem red roses. Got two bunches of 5 long stem pink roses. Have raised a support case with Uber Eats. Harris Farm Boronia Park in Sydney. How did they come, curious if it comes in paper or how the bottom is wrapped. Thanks They came wrapped in plastic cellophane type stuff, bottoms exposed, placed in a paper Harris farm bag Getting jipped with colour and quantity. FrankGrimes has a right to vent ! Yes same happened with me - ordered red then pink arrived. Not sure if the uber eats rider picks them or they are picked and bagged by the store? Either way, they were refunded, just follow the links to report an issue with the order and take a picture I reported it last night but have heard nothing back from Uber Eats support. Useless Strange! Mine seemed to be refunded immediately (and automatically) with no fuss Anybody know of some good options like this but in Melbourne? $6.99 delivery fee for me (Canberra) :( Item replaced - Sydney. What was yours replaced with? Not a cat I hope :D Haha nothing with a tail. Use this to chase tail. Just a heads up, it comes with the pricing sticker attached. It's also wrapped in a black piece of plastic with the flower sticking out the top Thanks for the info, does it come with any name/payment details aswell? In my case just in a Harris Farm brown paper grocery bag within which was the 10 stem bouquet. Ordered the red bouquets, got white. Went through Uber Eats to complain, got a refund immediately- minus $1.99 delivery. $1.99 for the 10 long stems white roses, yes please. Winning Easy enough to dye them red! Winning! Do you have a picture? Was it the original price or the discounted price on the sticker? Original price $15.99 just for delivery in Sydney - crazy. Not if you’re 20km from the nearest Harris Farm.. I got $2.99 delivery fee in Sydney, however it was deducted (I don't have Uber One) and only $1 service fee charged. I was able to choose the date and the tile slot. 10 stem bunch of Blue Iris for $7.64 delivered. That's almost free. Free delivery. Booked to tomorrow arvo. 15 yrs married and no flowers, let's see if this yr is a winner. Too far from store :(, won’t even allow me to enter pickup Harris Farm? Uber Eats? where is the nutritional value on this? Roses out of stock in Qld but ordered a different bunch + choccies and chippies, total $30. Mrs will be stoked. Which store? West end Uber one but also paid more at checkout (NSW) Thought I’d get in early and order today. Flowers were unavailable (red roses) selected colored roses which was an upsell. Waited and order wasn’t cancelled anyway. Maybe plan ahead or have plan b ready. Ended up getting 2 bunches from QE foodstores for 50% off.. not a bad alt or choice if available to you. Worked out cheaper than Harris Farm with good options. Not available in regional area (Northern NSW) and the price has also changed to $24.80. The price of all of the flowers have gone up today compared to yesterday. I had some in my cart to order this morning and the discounted price had gone up over $4 per bunch. Was ordering multiple bunches of different flowers. All have gone up in price, some quite significantly. Can anyone comment on the quality of these ? Ordered two bunches for my girlfriend and wife. They have def overhauled the stock this morning with the Valentines options. Still some value to be found. Just got 20 roses and 10 tulips for $27 delivered to my office tomorrow. Will mix myself and leave in the garage Thurs night to give on Fri morning.

Title: I switched to a new Android voice assistant, and Google Gemini now feels outdated

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onFebruary 9, 2025 When Google announced that it would be replacing the Assistant with Gemini, I braced for what I assumed would be the inevitable: a feature-rich experience marred by a frustrating transition period. Almost exactly one year later, however, the transition has actually gone smoother than I expected. Setting reminders and controlling smart home devices now work, and I haven’t found myself completely lost without the old Google Assistant. But while Gemini hasn’t been the disaster I feared, I can’t say it’s a clear upgrade either. For all of Google’s promises about deeper reasoning and higher-quality responses, I feel like there’s very little that Gemini can do that Assistant couldn’t. So when I learned that AI startup Perplexity was stepping up to offer an alternative, I was immediately curious to see how it compared to Google’s old and new assistants. And after a week of use, I can confidently say that I won’t be returning to Gemini anytime soon. As I mentioned earlier, Gemini’s numerous extensions mean that it can now control my smart home and take notes. However, it fails just as miserably at answering questions as the outgoing Google Assistant. My main gripe with Gemini stems from how much it relies on the underlying large language model (and its personal knowledge) to answer my queries instead of using its built-in search engine. Case in point, I routinely ask Gemini for stock prices and get variable results that frustrate me to no end. A prompt like “How is Apple’s stock price doing?” once yielded a vague response about the company’s financial performance over the past few months, but crucially, didn’t deliver a price quote at all. It wasn’t until I specifically asked “What is Apple’s stock price?” that Gemini finally gave me a definitive answer. And even then, it linked me to three other websites and lectured me on the volatility of stock prices. Perplexity, meanwhile, responds to such queries with a rich information box that even contains an interactive chart. Take a look for yourself. This isn’t a one-off, I’ve run into the same problem when trying to convert currencies on multiple occasions. Ask Gemini how much 100 USD is in Euros, and you’re more likely to get a disclaimer about exchange rate fluctuations than an actual number. If the stars align, you might get an answer but it might just be faster to use Google Search instead. Perplexity, on the other hand, does exactly what I want from an assistant: it pulls real-time exchange rates from multiple sources and clearly presents them, albeit without the pretty charts this time. More importantly, though, it performs this task consistently every single time. Next, I asked both assistants, “Where can I watch the re-release of Interstellar this weekend?” Here, Gemini did exactly what I’d expect the decade-old Google Assistant to do: it flat out refused to look for an answer. It’s quite an embarrassing result, to say the least. Meanwhile, Perplexity performed a quick search and analyzed eight sources to offer a release date and recommendations on how to book tickets. From here, I simply used Google’s Circle to Search and navigated to one of the booking websites myself. Is Perplexity’s response perfect? Not at all, but it’s a big step up over Gemini. While most competing digital assistants on Android stop at answering questions, that’s not the case with Perplexity. Like Gemini, you can ask it to perform a handful of phone-related tasks like send a text message or email, call a contact, and open an app. It can also play music via Spotify and set reminders. Impressively, Perplexity can understand vague instructions like “Remind me to watch the next season of The White Lotus when it releases.” Here, you’d expect the assistant to look for the show’s release date first and set a reminder accordingly and that’s exactly what Perplexity does. When I tried the same prompt with Gemini, I was horrified to find that it simply set up a task with the entire text instead of following the instructions at the end. This is the kind of inconsistency that makes Google’s AI experience so frustrating to live with and potentially dangerous if you rely on it for anything important. Perplexity can also perform multiple tasks at once, similar to Gemini’s multi-extension functionality that Samsung showcased at the recent Galaxy S25 launch event. For example, it can find nearby Thai restaurants and set a reminder to book a table at one later. On that note, Perplexity has a couple of cool tricks up its sleeve. For one, you can ask it to book a table and it will bring you to the restaurant’s OpenTable page to set up a reservation. Likewise, you can book an Uber ride using just your voice — I tested it with the prompt “Get me a ride to the airport” and it worked as expected. Perplexity has a surprisingly good handle at localized suggestions too. It managed to give me directions to the nearest coffee shop (a non-chain location at that) and booking a cab to the spot was just another voice command away. Finally, Perplexity can also read the contents of your screen when required. This means you can instruct it to do things like summarize the contents of your screen and then send the result as an email to a friend. Or as I tend to use it the most, translate a foreign language. Gemini has offered this feature for a while now, so I’m glad I didn’t lose it when I switched to Perplexity Assistant. Perplexity may have the upper hand in some areas, but it’s not exactly equal to Gemini yet either. Unlike Perplexity, Google’s assistant can read your emails, access files from Drive, and integrate more seamlessly with services like Tasks and Assistant Routines. The closest Perplexity can get to reading your inbox is summarizing your notifications, which is helpful but nowhere near as powerful. Another key difference is how you invoke each assistant. Gemini supports a wake word for hands-free activation, whereas Perplexity requires holding down the power button or using a diagonal swipe gesture. I personally don’t mind this since I’m usually holding my phone when I need assistance, but it’s a notable limitation nonetheless. Perplexity also lacks any smart home controls at the moment — though that might not be a dealbreaker if you already own smart speakers. The one missing piece that might be harder to ignore is calendar integration. As of now, Perplexity can’t link to a calendar, meaning you can’t check or add events. This is an easily solved problem over time, though, as plenty of other apps allow you to link your Google account for calendar and Drive access. With these downsides then, should you switch to Perplexity? It comes down to what you need from your phone’s digital assistant. If your priority is getting answers to questions reliably, no matter how vaguely worded, Perplexity is the superior choice without a doubt. But if you need your assistant to interface directly with your digital life, Gemini holds the edge for the time being. For now, I’ve made my switch, and I don’t regret it. Gemini could appreciably improve in the future, but Perplexity does everything I need and then some. More than anything, I’m just glad there’s real competition in this space. After all, it was only a few years ago that the stagnating Google Assistant was the only viable option.

To add cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio, look for companies with strong growth records and ... [+] improving profitability. Executive leaders recently identified cyber and technology risk as primary threats to business growth, according to a survey from insurer Chubb. More than 40% of executive respondents noted that cyber threat monitoring is an essential function within their organization. That percentage will likely rise as the cybersecurity landscape gets more complex. A World Economic Forum analysis cites several factors that are creating more complexity. They include hackers’ use of AI technology, rising geopolitical tensions and the increase in data protection regulations. This fast-changing environment creates opportunities for the best cybersecurity stocks to thrive. Proven cybersecurity providers will become invaluable to their customers and gain pricing power as a result. To benefit from these trends, consider adding targeted cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio. Read on to meet six cybersecurity stocks with growth potential in 2025 and beyond. Identifying these best cybersecurity stock picks began with listing all holdings within WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR) and Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG). From that group, stocks with these qualities were removed from consideration: The remaining nine cybersecurity stocks were ordered by free cash flow (FCF) per share—highest to lowest—and the bottom three were dropped. FCF was calculated from each company's most recent year-end financial releases as operating cash flow less capital expenditures or capex. Capex included purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software costs. The table below identifies six cybersecurity stocks poised for growth in 2025. Read on to learn more about these cybersecurity companies and why they may be candidates for your portfolio. Bulleted metrics come from stockanalysis.com, except for the FCF per share, which was calculated from company financial releases. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025, best energy stocks and best growth stocks. Akamai Technologies provides cloud computing, content delivery and cybersecurity solutions. Application and API security, bot and abuse protection, infrastructure security and programs supporting a zero-trust strategy are part of the offering. A zero-trust security strategy assumes breach is possible within networks and verifies every transaction accordingly. Akamai sells to financial companies, video streaming companies, healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceuticals and the U.S. military. Akamai has proven its ability to drive sales and earnings growth. Although the sales trajectory has been more linear than earnings, the company has the highest and most consistent operating margin among the stocks on this list. Akamai is currently seeing momentum in security solutions and cloud computing. In its most recent earnings release, the company reported 17% quarter-over-quarter sales growth in these areas. Company-wide sales growth rose a more subdued 4%. Going forward, analysts expect high-single-digit sales growth for Akamai through 2028, with annual EPS in the range of about $6.50 to nearly $10. Zscaler operates a cloud security platform sold to customers on a subscription basis. Customers operate in various sectors, including household and personal products, banking, transportation, hospitality and biotech. Zscaler says its inline security cloud platform is the world’s largest. The company launched in 2007 and has since produced impressive year-over-year sales growth. In the past three years, sales grew an average of 48% annually. The profit side of the equation has been more challenging. Zscaler has not yet achieved GAAP earnings. However, the company does have strong cash flow and the second-highest FCF per share on this list. Cash flow production should continue, as the Zscaler team optimizes its already effective go-to-market and upsell strategies. In the October 2024 quarter, Zscaler reported 26% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth on "strong sales execution." Operating cash flow was $291.9 million and 53% of revenue. The GAAP loss per share shrank to $30.7 million from $46.1 million in the prior year period. Okta provides cloud-based workforce and customer identity solutions. The company is best known for its gateway service that allows authenticated users to access multiple applications with one login. Customers include more than half of Fortune 100 companies plus thousands of other organizations. Okta has strong market positioning, good growth history and a solid customer list. Recently, the company has been focused on attracting more high-value contracts and innovating its offering to enhance upsell opportunities. For fiscal year 2025, the leadership team expects 15% sales growth and a FCF margin of 25%. Admittedly, a 15% sales growth expectation doesn’t compare well to Okta's history. Annual sales growth from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 ranged from 40% to 55%. Fiscal 2024 sales growth was about 20%. Data breaches have been a lingering problem for Okta. Incidents in 2022 and 2023 kept OKTA’s stock price low, as other tech stocks rebounded strongly from the 2022 tech sell-off. However, in a recent earnings call, the company said the 2023 breach was no longer affecting results quantifiably. As a potential investor, you can assess Okta's breach history in two ways. You can assume Okta could repeat its mistakes, which would be bad for customers and shareholders. Or, you can interpret Okta's troubles as a possible buying opportunity for a company with some positives: Okta operates in a growing industry, produces more than $400 million annually in FCF and is nearing GAAP profitability. Datadog sells technology monitoring and logging services. Customers use the platform to manage, troubleshoot and optimize their cloud-based IT infrastructure, including servers, applications and databases. The customer list includes Samsung, Shell, Deloitte, Comcast and Nasdaq. In 2023, Grand View Research estimated the global cloud market value at $602.31 billion. The researcher also projected a CAGR of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030. That growth benefits Datadog, which has a strong market position in cloud security. The company’s platform also integrates with OpenAI so customers can track the usage and performance of their AI-based applications. Stifel analysts recently downgraded DDOG due to uncertainty around the company’s potential in the AI monitoring space. However, Bank of America Securities analyst Koji Ikeda has a different view, as reported by Business Insider. Ikeda recently maintained a buy rating on DDOG stock and raised the price target—noting that the company's long-term prospects without AI are still promising. For the September quarter, Datadog reported 26% higher sales quarter-over-quarter and strong growth in customers with annual recurring revenue of at least $100,000. The company also produced FCF of $204 million. Elastic N.V. makes enterprise software that searches, analyzes, logs and visualizes data. The company is best known for its Elasticsearch application, used by popular apps like Uber, Instacart and Tinder. Elastic also offers an AI-powered security solution for detecting, investigating and responding to cybersecurity threats. Analysts appreciate Elastic’s position in AI and cybersecurity, two fast-growing industries. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has cited AI as the bigger growth engine for Elastic. Ives believes Elastic will see continued strong demand for its platform as the AI revolution continues. Investors appreciate Elastic's habit of beating earnings expectations. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, Elastic outperformed the EPS consensus by 36% and 55%, respectively. Highlights from the second quarter include an 18% revenue gain, a 59% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and a 16% increase in the high-value customer count from the prior-year quarter. High-value customers are those with annual contract values over $100,000. Rapid7 manages an AI-powered vulnerability management platform that can analyze network activity, proactively identify threats, test applications for security holes, monitor cloud resources and third-party integrations and respond to threats. Rapid7 generates more than $820 million in annual recurring revenue and services more than 11,000 customers. While the company’s revenue growth has slowed recently, Rapid7 has also recently achieved GAAP profitability—a milestone in the cybersecurity space. After producing a GAAP net loss of $149 million in 2023, the company has delivered GAAP net income of $46.9 million over the last 12 months. However, analyst Adam Borg of Stifel Nicolaus is cautious about Rapid7’s growth prospects. Borg says the vulnerability management niche within cybersecurity may not provide the growth investors want to see from Rapid7. Despite Borg's opinion, the average analyst earnings outlook for Rapid7 is positive. Estimates show steady EPS growth from $2.31 in 2024 to $4.02 in 2029. In the third quarter 2024, Rapid7 grew sales 8% year-over-year, and produced FCF of $39 million. Technology and geopolitical trends may create tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks in the coming years. The most effective providers will benefit the most. To add cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio, look for companies with strong growth records and improving profitability. You can alternatively opt for a cybersecurity ETF that spreads risk out over a few dozen securities. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.
