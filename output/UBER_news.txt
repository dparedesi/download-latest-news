Title: WeRide’s CEO pitches robotaxis as a solution to aging populations and long commutes, as the firm raises more money for R&D with a HK IPO

Nicholas Gordon is an Asia editor based in Hong Kong, where he helps to drive Fortune’s coverage of Asian business and economics news. Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech. WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme. “We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.” Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.” Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year. Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment. Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards. The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024. Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%. WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close. WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%. Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models. Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans. “Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.” Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.” There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.” That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.” WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024. Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch. Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies. Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles. China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles. Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year. Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe. By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London. Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it? “When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said. “If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?” Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

November 05, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. HONG KONG, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (HKEX: 0800.HK, NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its successful listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEX) under the stock code 0800.HK, becoming the world's first Robotaxi company to be publicly traded on both Hong Kong and US exchanges. With that, WeRide also becomes the world's first Robotaxi and autonomous driving technology company to achieve a dual primary listing on both HKEX and NASDAQ. Under its Hong Kong listing, WeRide issued a total of 88.25 million shares (pre-greenshoe), with 17.65 million shares offered publicly and 70.60 million shares for international placement. The offer price was set at HKD 27.1 per share, raising a total of approximately HKD 2.39 billion (pre-greenshoe). Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, had voluntarily committed to a three-year lock-up on October 28, 2025, pledging not to sell any of his shares for the next three years. This demonstrated the founder's and management team's confidence in WeRide's fundamentals and growth, as well as their full commitment to the company's long-term vision and global expansion. "We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society," said Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, at the listing ceremony. Founded in 2017, WeRide was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on October 25, 2024, becoming the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi and universal autonomous driving technology company.

Coming into this interview I wasn’t even sure what “AI Transformation” was, let alone why so many companies pay for it. Here’s the deal: Tenex, the company founded by Alex Lieberman & Arman Hezarkhani, goes into companies hunting for ways to save or making them money using AI. Once they find that, it becomes a no brainer for companies to hire them to build it. But Tenex does more than AI Transformation. They also run a dev shop where their developers use AI to build super fast for clients. The podcast is in all major apps, just search for Mixergy.You can also use our RSS feed. Alex Lieberman and Arman Hezarkhani are the co-founders of Tenex, a company blending high-performance engineering with AI transformation consulting. Their model aligns incentives around output rather than time, helping enterprises and startups build software faster and integrate AI across people, processes, and tools. Together, they’re building what they call the “McKinsey for AI”—a hybrid of dev shop, consultancy, and innovation lab helping companies thrive in the post-AI era. Andrew Warner: Hey there, freedom Fighters. My name is Andrew Warner and this is a new series for me. It’s called The Next New Thing. Here’s what’s up in this interview, then an intro. Then we’ll get right to it. What is AI transformation? Alex: We don’t think most companies are going to Arman: cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai, and we believe we can be the household name to do that. Andrew Warner: Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do that wasn’t possible. Before Arman: STEP exports, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app. Traditionally, you would need a full design team, product managers, engineers, and a ton of money using AI tools. When we hear, oh, I have a request for a feature, we go over there and we prototype it and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how you want it to behave? Now we can go and we can build production grade code incredibly quickly. Andrew Warner: At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with business? I’m a Andrew Warner: little skeptical. Alex Lieberman and Armand has ar Connie run 10 x, which does outsource dev work and helps companies use ai. Intro: The next new thing, Andrew Warner: so I got the two co-founders of 10 X here in front of me, and the thing that I wanna understand is what is AI transformation? Because I see so many agencies building up this AI transformation practice. And you both have been doing phenomenally with it. In fact, you actually are doing it as part of your business. Arman: So most of the revenue comes from engineering, but our fastest growing part of the business is AI transformation. It, it’s very easy to implement AI as a person. In your lead, you can basically tell somebody, Hey, Andrew, instead of using Google, start using this thing called chat, GBT. You use it once and then you’re like, holy crap, this is really great. And then you just very simply shift your behavior. It’s literally one step. But to do that on a business, we call that like multiplayer ai. That’s really, really tough. That takes studying, that takes change management, that takes tool building, that takes training. It takes the change of people, process and technology and McKinsey words. Um, and that’s where we come in. Alex: And one thing that you may find interesting is why we’re doing like engineering as a service as like a big part of our business, um, versus just AI transformation. Armand and I met. Five years ago, I had invested in his first business and we were catching up eight months ago at this point. And he basically had shared with me that he had to pivot his previous company and when he pivoted it, he had to lay off most of his engineering team and he just had himself and he had one product designer who studied Compsci in college but hadn’t had hands on keyboard in a long time. And yet their output of production ready software, five Xed. And when I asked why or how, he basically said how he didn’t have a choice but to basically re scaffold the entire product and engineering process from how PRDs are written to how code is structured. Everything was redone and. When I heard him say this, that for me, even though I’ve experienced like two or three acts, whatever the improvement is of cha bt, that was truly orders of magnitude more leverage that I had seen. And one of the things I’ve realized working around engineers now is engineers are living in the future. Like they are seeing the greatest leverage of AI relative to all areas of knowledge work. And so as we were building 10 x, you know, we had that in mind, which is like you can have this incredible leverage, uh, that engineers are experiencing. At the same time you have AI consultancies or like, you know, the mbbs of the world that are doing these gen AI projects. And there’s all these stats either about gen AI projects just like not working, right? There’s like the, the MIT study that came out around 95% of them don’t work. But also a lot of this work is project based. It’s one time revenue. And for us what was exciting was. How do we actually control the AI internally where we have engineers who are leveraging it to be far more productive than engineers at other companies? How do we use that to sign 12 month contracts? Right? That is highly retentive, highly recurring, and we use that as the Trojan Horse to do transformation work after having that line of business. Jesse Pujji: What’s a typical scope Arman: from the engineering perspective? It’s basically like, one of the core beliefs is that the demand for software engineering is infinite. Uh, it’s, it’s completely as price will go down, the, the, the demand will increase. And so the scope is pretty vast right now. Like we’re building one of our clients, we built them a mobile app that hit 20th in the app store for another one of our clients. We built a, um, an AI agent that helps the front desk at offices around the United States at, at, um. Healthcare offices, like doctor’s offices around the us Jesse Pujji: But is it fair to say right now, I guess it’s, it’s like a, there’s a lot of companies out there that will do engineering. Hey, you need an app built, you need a website, you know, whatever. We’ll do that for you. But you guys have now, are now using probably cursor plus your own agents that handle a lot of, you know, pieces of building those building blocks together. And I know Alex loves Legos. So you’ve got your own Legos that are proprietary to you guys. Legos that allow you to then produce bigger, faster, smarter, that same scope, Alex: the engineering as a service side of the business. Just think of it as like a high quality AI powered dev shop. Jesse Pujji: Mm-hmm. Alex: And I actually love the idea of that line of business because dev shops have such an unsexy perception. Mm-hmm. We don’t charge hourly. Like we have a fundamental belief that service businesses are gonna move away from hourly work. Yeah. And we think it’s starting with engineering. So our clients pay us based on output and our engineers are paid on output as well. And the reason that is so valuable. We can hire truly the best engineers I’ve ever worked with because, just as an example, like our best engineer will make a million bucks in cash next year. Jesse Pujji: Yep. Alex: And and and it’s not like stock in a startup, it’s cash, Jesse Pujji: cash money. Yeah, Alex: exactly. And Jesse Pujji: so, like Alex, you and I talked a lot about the Red Ventures business. They’re all about alignment. And Andrew came with me to see Rick, uh, the other day about a year ago. And one of his favorite quotes is, show me how someone gets paid and I’ll show you how they behave. And this feels like a really cool way to align the value based pricing orientation across, across the board. Alex: Exactly. And what that allows us to do that, as you were alluding to, like the big vision is it not only allows us to do great work on the service side of the business, whether that’s engineering or transformation work, but as we think about building IP internally, we truly have the best technical talent in the world to do it because like we, we are now as competitive in terms of pay and environment as a big tech company. Jesse Pujji: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. What’s the big vision? Arman: Was looking, or we were looking at the, the big hyperscalers and seeing that they’re spending billions and billions and billions of dollars building data centers to build something that is being commoditized, um, where most of the values accruing to the application layer. And so if you look at OpenAI, if you look at anthropic, so many of their releases now that are getting eyeballs are apps that they released and application layer tools that they release. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: For the first time, like we were all really excited about GPT-3 0.5. And so when they released 4, 4 0 4 0.5, we were all, that was like an Apple release. Right? Right. But when five was released, no one like this was like a, an after crickets. Yeah. Alex: Absolute crickets. Arman: But what that does is it opens up an opportunity in the application layer where for zero cost, you can compete with these hyperscalers. All you need is brilliant people in a ring. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: And so. In, when I was in like 10th grade, I read this book by Walter Isaacson called The Innovators. Basically the story of like the people who like invented the first computer and the first programming language all the way to like modern internet ai, mobile devices. Basically, it, it, it, it becomes this, this study of how innovation happens, and it’s a very simple equation. You put very smart people in a room. You give them freedom, but you also put freedom in the form of like financial freedom or somehow mm-hmm. You give them fuel, but then you also give them a direction and you give them some form of commercial pressure, right? In the form of, um, whether that is investment, you have to get a return or I’m, I’m, I’m, uh, bell Telephone Company and, and Bell Labs is a research institution, but they have to output something for the company. Similarly, we think that if we can build a team of geniuses and we can give them freedom and direction, then we can compete with these hyperscalers. The question is how do you do that? How do you build a team of geniuses? This is how, um, we’re doing it starting with the world’s best dev shop, then the world’s best consultancy. And as we’re doing this, we’re building ip. And by the way, as we do that, we have a distribution advantage, not only from Alex, but also from the customers that we built trust with and we’re actually already working with. And we think that, that the tam for this business is basically the GDP of the entire world. Every single business need in the world sure needs it in those Alex: 1 1, 1 other way I would just frame it is what would it look like if McKinsey Bayner, BCG was created today? Jesse Pujji: Right? So, but is that, is that the end game? Do you wanna be, become the McKinsey of AI or the Accenture even? Alex: Our view is there’s this massive technology innovation that’s happening. We don’t think most companies are going to be resourced to cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai. And we believe we can be the household name to do that, either through services or through product. Andrew Warner: Here’s what I wanna understand. Let’s stick with the dev part for a bit and then we’ll come back to the AI transformation. Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do and what your developers were able to do that wasn’t possible before. Okay. Arman: Yeah. So as an example, use step exports. Okay. They’re a social media company. Um, and the reason why I use them is because they were traditionally going with a, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app that is basically like their vision for it is like HQ trivia for sports fans. Okay. Traditionally, for a product like this, you would need a full design team, a full team of product managers, a team of engineers, um, and you would charge a ton of money and it would take, you would basically scope out the entire project and then six months later you’d come back with a product and then it would either work or wouldn’t. Um, the way that we work is. We hear, oh, I have a request for a feature. We go over there, we prototype it, and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how we want it to behave? And then we have a brand book from them. And so we know what the UI generally should look like. We know what a button looks like, we know what an input looks like. And now that we know what the behavior looks like, because we’re able to, to iterate on it, um, in a vibe coding platform, now we can go and we can build production grade, uh, code incredibly quickly. The act of writing code is no longer the barrier. So no one on our team actually types letters into an id. If I walk through a WeWork and I see someone typing letters in IID they’re working in like 1990, right? Yeah. So we’re using, we’re pushing modern AI tools to the absolute limit so that we are scoping work down until the, the most atomic level, and then we’re getting it done and we’re architecting it such that we’re really treating these AI agents. What does Andrew Warner: it mean to scope, to scope down to the atomic level? Arman: So let’s say you wanna build Slack, right? Andrew Warner: Yep. Arman: It’s a gigantic platform. And typically what you would do is you would manage, you’d, you’d have a product manager who would break that down into, uh, sprints, and then they would break those down into tickets, right? Yep. And then at, at, to some extent, the engineer would have quite a bit of freedom around that ticket. The tickets are quite broad. We go, we drill, our engineers drill all the way down until they’re micro tasks. And this is really what, this is the difference between an AI engineer and a traditional software engineer. An AI engineer needs to think like an architect. They have to think as if they’re, uh, they’re delegating all of their work to other engineers. And when they’re delegating their work, how do they do that? Right? And not only are they delegating their work to engineers, they’re very special engineers. These AI agents, they’re incredibly high iq, but they make really stupid mistakes that as you work with them regularly, you can understand what they are. And when you work with these, you get really good at managing them and understanding them. Most of our engineers have multiple different terminals open each with a different coding agent, and they’re just, they’re trucking on all of them. So they’re really acting as managers Of these different agents, are Jesse Pujji: they, are they using voice or are they using, are they, are they typing? Arman: Frankly, I think that the voice thing’s overblown. I think that when you work in an office, it’s like unrealistic to talk out loud. I think that the voice thing is like useful if you’re an executive driving your Tesla to and from work and you wanna, and you wanna speak to, to an ai. Jesse Pujji: So you don’t think the whole world’s gonna start talking to their computers and, and voice pilled? Arman: I, I think they might, but like in our office, for example, it’s impractical and I don’t know how that works in, in a modern office setting. I Jesse Pujji: think I understand when you’re scoping this piece of work, you launch a mobile app for someone, you can be, I’m, I’m making this up, you can be cheaper to them than they would’ve paid otherwise because of all this stuff you guys have done and it’s probably higher margin business for you guys. Alex: Yeah. Uh, the way I basically think about it is it’s, it’s, um, Jesse Pujji: because you have like a 10% engineer, 11% engineering team, but it’s really only one human being and 10. Correct. 10 pieces of Alex: it’s, it’s basically if, if traditional dev orgs or dev shops are labor arbitrage, we’re intelligence arbitraging. Jesse Pujji: I mean, it’s interesting, the AI transformation aspect of that is that just sizzle really. And then the real thing is actually just go get media engineering projects and, and focus on those. Like for example, today, I would argue with you and Alex, this is, Alex is my friend, so we’re gonna keep this as informal as possible. Like I would tell you guys today, I obviously believe that AI transformation will be a hundreds of billions of dollars industry. But today Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Engineering development is actually a multi-hundred billion and AI transformation is like a $10 billion industry. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, uh, candidly this is something we talk about all of the time, uh, is what should that balance look like? Because the engineering as a service business one, there are, there’s really no one else doing it in the way we’re doing it right now. And also it is such good revenue, like it is just so retentive, it’s latched onto the core technology of a company. Totally. Whereas to your point, like AI transformation oftentimes is project based. It’s harder to make recurring, Jesse Pujji: well, not to mention like problem versus solution, right? I mean, one thing you guys have to be careful of, there’s this, there’s this meme that was going around that was like, CEOs are like, we want ai. Yep. You must’ve shared it, Alex. Like, Alex: when, when do we want it? We want it now. Jesse Pujji: What, what do we want it for? We have no idea. Like, yeah. And that’s, there’s actually a lot of risk and wasted time and energy in terms of firm building. If you guys are building a firm off of this fickle revenue where nobody actually has a problem, they’re just looking for a solution and as opposed to finding problems, that’s a much, much more interesting place to be playing in and solving the problem better and cheaper and faster than anybody else can solve it. ’cause here’s, here’s another, I’ll throw crazy idea as you, uh, you, Alex, with your platform when Red Ventures bought bank rate. If it was a publicly traded company, they paid $1.3 billion for it. They paid 10 times ebitda, roughly, according to their math. Rick knew he had done the math, he had seen all the levers. He knew that within a year of closing it, I mean, his projections were that his effective EBITDA would’ve been five times EBITDA because he knew exactly how he was gonna double the EBITDA of the business. And he came in three months ahead of time. He got it done in nine months, right? Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You guys, if, if what you’re saying is real and you get really good at it, you could go buy these dev shops and, and essentially you could increase, they already have books of business, by the way, which is, which is makes your life so much easier than Alex tweeting all the time. And you go buy a $10 million revenue business with all the clients and everything already, and you guys can effectively rip out 70% of their costs, it sounds like, and deliver a better product. And now that’s like the math there is actually more compelling. ’cause you could probably buy ’em at six times EBITDA effectively, but then you’re actually buying ’em at three. Like anytime you have a real capability, that thesis is like very, very powerful. Alex: Yeah. Yeah. You’re basically just, you’re buying distribution and you know, you can basically arb the product, like the, the customer experience, Jesse Pujji: not, not to mention, dude, you can finance the whole thing with debt. Like, if you buy something at six times, you can borrow half that cost. But if you’re effectively, because you know, you can double their ebitda, you effectively have no equity out. I mean, that’s how, like, there’s a company in St. Louis, I found the other day that I got all excited about, you’ve never heard of it? It’s called Proficient. Alex: No, Jesse Pujji: it just sold for $3 billion. I mean, it’s, it’s been around 20 years, but it’s literally like a rollup of one of these, like Salesforce, Microsoft Alex: implementation Jesse Pujji: companies, implementation companies. And it just, every year it would like pick a different part of the, the, you know, the, I think I call it the function vertical box, like HR for pharma, marketing for, and it just, but did a bunch of deals and like exited for $3 billion. Um, Arman: so Jesse, let me ask you this. We love all our children equally, whether you’re an engineering client or a transformation client, you’re, you’re a 10 x client, you’re part of the club, and let’s say we can drive some amount of efficiency for our clients, right? You’re talking about driving efficiency for a dev shop, but what if we can prove that we’re driving efficiency for our clients? Right. How do you think about deploying that company to AI transformation or like general efficiency, like a traditional PE clay or focusing on dev shop and going that direction? Jesse Pujji: Yeah, I, I mean, I would, I, I would chase the problems. I guess. Like, it, it kind of like, I mean, if you would’ve solved the same problem, let’s, it’s, you know, and this is what our RCTO tells me all the time, Adam. He’s like, look, you just think about the, how do you, how does anyone decide how to spend money on dev? They do impact, cost, and ease, right? Through the same analysis. How big could this be money-wise, saving us? How confident are we gonna work and how costly or expensive is it? And we, you know, at am push, we used to do that all the time and like, it was like, damn, should we build our own? The API pulls from data’s Facebook layer, or should we use a third party or, you know, should we not do it at all? And then everyone does the stack ranking and they go, well, we only have $2 million of engineering resources, or $3 million of engineering resources. So we should basically say no to everything below this hurdle. But now you guys know this, like AI allows us to go faster and way cheaper, but it’s like if everything gets cheaper and faster, then the amount of things people are gonna do is gonna go up dramatically. Andrew Warner: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So I guess my answer to that is like, what are the real problems they have that like the, those, those, and, and maybe some of your projects still are 90% non-AI, but you’re using all your AI tools to do it. ’cause as you guys wa I mean watch anyone coding with Cursor or any of these other tools and it’s fucking insane. Like Yeah, I, my my point is like the actual AI ness of it is not actually that important. If I’m you guys based on Arman: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: What, what Alex said about the, ’cause I’m, by the way, I’m a services business guy. Like annual contracts, aligned compensation models, margins improving like. Services business are hard to build for a reason because most people don’t have some of those things. And even like, I mean I always talk about this like publicly aush growth assistant very soon, like within months is gonna pass ambush as ebitda. Do you know why? Alex: The cost of labor? Jesse Pujji: Nope. Retention. Arman: Mm-hmm. Jesse Pujji: Aush would get big and then two of our biggest clients would churn because they’re, oh, we’re gonna take this in-house. People don’t take global talent in-house for the most part. Like some of our bigger clients have said, Hey, we have some, but like that isn’t, you’re making a thousand bucks a month off. I mean like we just, the retention in am in AM and growth systems is amazing. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right. And so that’s, I would just like tell you guys, McKinsey, by the way, and some of these guys have massive retention. Alex: Are you saying basically just because of the partner’s relationship, they’re constantly selling in new work Jesse Pujji: constantly. And that doesn’t even, by the way, at their prices, just, and, and this is something we see with OX too. We see a lot of like, oh, it’s not, it’s not like SaaS retention, but it is like they keep coming back to us for more and more projects, of course. And we feel good that we can actually manage and project that. So, Alex: and, and to your question about is it sizzle? I think irrespective of what direction we choose, like what is the balance of engineering or transformation work, I do think positioning in a AI transformation way gets us more engineering clients than if we did not position in that way. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, fair enough. Alex: Half of our clients have come through these free AI diagnostics We do. And so we run these diagnostics. They take two weeks. Most of it’s been automated. The only thing that’s not automated is basically three hours of stakeholder interviews, but half of those have turned into our engineering clients. That’s smart. And so, yeah. Andrew Warner: So wait, let’s, let’s talk about the transformation part of the business. Gimme an example of what you’ve done for someone. What did they walk in with? How did you understand what they needed and then what did they buy? Arman: The first part, the understanding what they needed is, is actually the core. And the way we do that is, um, Alex is talking about what we call our diagnostic, and that’s the free version. And then we also have an audit, which is the, the paid version. It’s basically anywhere from like 10 to 20 interviews, data requests, a survey, a lot of deep research that we do on our own, like, um, and, but the output of either of these, obviously the diagnostic is lighter than the audit is a report. The report has our learnings. It’s aligned with the goals of the business. Whatever Andrew Warner: pick, pick one. Pick a specific customer. You don’t have to tell me their name. What did you do? What, uh, what did you, what did you talk to them about? What did you uncover and what, what did you do afterwards, after this transformation? Arman: So, basically, one of them is a, is a SaaS company that works in healthcare. We did an audit for them. Um, and there are two types of interviews that we do in the audit. Or actually, lemme start with the survey. So the survey, basically the way that we think about it is. It goes to everybody in the company, or if, if the audit is specifically part of the, of the go to market org, Andrew Warner: whatever. But again, gimme, gimme a specific company. I need to see the picture of what this is. So a billboard company finds you because of Alex’s tweets, I’m assuming? Yeah. Arman: Yeah. Okay. So Alex posts on LinkedIn. Uh, actually, uh, quick, quick, quick kind of note here. All of our businesses come through LinkedIn, not Twitter. So, wow. So, so basically there’s a, there’s a billboard company and there’s the, they do traditional billboard selling where like, you’ll, you’re a big business and you’ll call them up and you say, Hey, I want to be on a billboard. And they, they’ll put you there. But they also have like a, a platform that’s similar to Uber for billboards, where you can go on, you can upload a picture, you can say, I want it to go here. Click go. Okay, cool. They came to us saying, Hey, I want to use AI in the company. Uh, I want to work, I want AI to be in the engineering platform. I want AI to be in the product itself. We’re not sure where, but we know that there’s opportunities. Here are a few ideas, but we want you to greenfield. Go, go check it out. So we started with a survey. The goal of the survey sends to everyone in the company, and the goal is to understand, we basically think of that as building a map for us, right? It lays out the entirety of the company from an org chart perspective, but also it gives us an idea of where to look. Then, based on that, we set up interviews. So, so as an example, the survey really highlighted the product org. Okay? So we spoke to the product org. We had a couple of saw calls with sales. We had a couple of calls with other people just to kind of poke around different areas, but to really focus on product. Andrew Warner: Yeah, we Arman: spoke to the product manager, we spoke to engineers, we spoke to the CTO, all these different people on product. What we found is there were areas in of, of opportunity in their product, so we dug in deeper. We used the product, we checked it out in the flow. Similar to like if you’ve uploaded a a, a Facebook ad, you start with the Facebook ad, you set a goal. If you upload an image, you set a caption, whatever, and then you click go, I wanna run the Facebook ad. They have a similar flow for uploading a billboard. So you start with, I wanna run it on these billboards in this area. I have this goal and this budget. I wanna upload an image. And so on. We asked about drop off data, so where are people dropping off? And then we noticed that after this, we asked what happens after they click go? And there’s two levels of moderation that are done by humans. Okay. So even just in this flow, we notice that there’s drop off at either of those, uh, moderation levels. One of them is for like internal moderation, and then they send it to the billboard owner to moderate, and there’s drop off at each of those levels. Andrew Warner: And so you’re saying, look, we’re losing users. It’s human beings. Easy for us to use AI to replace humans. Give a response quickly. Got it. Arman: Exactly. Andrew Warner: Okay. Arman: Likewise, in the, in the, in the flow of uploading an image and, and uh, kind of building that campaign, we notice that people. People don’t know what a good ad is. Okay? And so they’re drop off of the creative step. And so we noticed that with the same algorithm that is helping do the moderation, we can also help give feedback on the creative that’s uploaded to the platform and even built in the platform using ai. Got it. So basically we made these recommendations. We said, Hey, we’re gonna build you an algorithm that’s going to be used in the creative step to give feedback. We’re also gonna use this to replace moderation. We’re also going to help you build AI powered, um, like an AI powered billboard generator and so on. We built a, we, we made a few of these recommendations, and for each one, there’s basically a lift versus reward. So how much is this gonna cost and how much are you gonna get out of this and that? What are you gonna get outta this is tied directly to the business’s goals, whether it be revenue, even, whatever. Andrew Warner: This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. So does that mean that all these AI transformation companies eventually have to turn into engineering businesses where they could get ongoing work? Or is there something that I’m missing in ongoing work in AI transformation? Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with a, with a business? I think that like there there are examples, an Andrew Warner: efficiency expert. Does they run outta work? Jesse Pujji: Sort of. I think there’s enough. I mean, uh, Andrew, I think, I think there’s a couple issues. You know, one is AI is changing at a rapid, rapid pace, right? Yeah. And when I built AM push every six months, Facebook would change the way it worked. And it was just to our benefit. Because every time AI changes, some new model’s gonna launch. And then the same people who you did work for a year ago are gonna like, oh shit, we need to do more work here. Right? So that’s one thing. But then the other thing is I think the point of. Consultancies exist and they ebb and flow. It’s not to, not to say there’s not cyclical market issues they have to deal with, but, but there’s always work for companies where they have problems and they have issues. Um, and, and you know, it’s pretty perpetual. Andrew Warner: I’m a little skeptical. I’ll be open with you because partially what I heard you all say, uh, both Armand and Alex say earlier is the reason the debt business is so exciting is there is ongoing work. Yeah. You get embedded, you keep building with them. So maybe, maybe there is some place where AI transformation just kind of, if not dies, it goes down dramatically and you have to keep getting new business. Alex: One question I would have for you is, so I think what you’re saying makes sense. Do you have an overall skepticism of management consulting firms? Andrew Warner: Interesting. I like the way you put that. I see You’re saying just like in management consulting firms, there’s always more management consulting, more ways to improve. Same thing here. Alex: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Sorry, I’m, I’m asking Chad GPT right now. How big is the third party engineering business? Andrew Warner: Well, the, the engineering part I get it’s the AI transformation company. Do you, at some point you, but those are gonna just Jesse Pujji: blend, right Andrew? Yeah, Andrew Warner: that’s what I, that’s what it seems like. Makes sense. That at some point it does need to be ongoing engineering work. Otherwise you can’t keep finding these places to cut human beings out. It eventually you’ve cut out all the human beings from the process. Let’s Jesse Pujji: stop using the word ai. ’cause the, the word AI is stupid. The real word is I can, I can build technology for you cheaper and faster than I used to be able to AI Arman: and not just build it, but also Jesse Pujji: ai. But, but like, yeah, Arman: yeah, Jesse Pujji: exactly. No, but that, like, that’s what you’re actually, the whole reason this is an opportunity is ’cause there’s tools and like our ability, Andrew, to like figure out content on our, on my posts and whatever, or like any of these things. We just would not have said yes to them before. If we had gone to Adam three years ago and said, Hey, Jesse’s gonna talk on pod, on like podcasts. You need to figure out how to take what he’s saying and turn that into written content. He would’ve been like, what? I need an NLP this and I need a database thing, this, and I need, and it’s like, dude, it would’ve been, he would’ve been sure I can do it for $3 million and I need six months to do that. And now it’s something they can do in a week because of ai. Andrew Warner: I see. So the ongoing opportunities to do work will keep coming up. So even if it’s some point, you get rid of the efficiency. There are new things to be built. Alex, I’m watching you. You’re, it’s either my connection is really bad that’s making you anxious, or there’s something you want to say and I’m holding you back from saying it. What is it? Alex: Because I think your, your gut reaction is a very natural reaction. Like, I actually, I, I think I’ve thought about this like, uh, my, my kind of like, um, it’s like the Jesse Pujji: old Indian uncle reaction. Alex: I was gonna say my, I used Jesse Pujji: to tell people we buy ads, ads on Facebook for people. The old Indian uncles would like, why can’t they grow tons themselves? What, what do they need you for? Alex: Yeah, I was, I was gonna say like my, my, um. My, my Jewish oc OCD is acting up right now. And what I’m thinking to myself is like, yeah, I’ve had this thought before and the way that I kind of think about it is similar to what Jesse Pujji: this is. Like Alex’s cold sweat dreams. You’re saying them as a fellow member of the tribe and he’s like, oh shit. Yeah. Why do they need us, Andrew? Alex: Oh no. The one question he wasn’t supposed to ask. Um, no, but I think there’s a few things. One is, I ultimately, the, the way that I think about it is like, consulting firms really just like are an index or like they latch onto being a, a growth and strategic partner for a business. And, and kind of the anchor for that is the partner who has the relationship with the CEO. And so the CEO whenever the, the CEO has cold sweats at night, uh, the CEO e’s not texting his best friend. He is texting his partner at Bain or BCG, or McKinsey. The way I think about it is AI is this incredible. Wedge into being a company’s growth partner and strategic partner in 2025. And so even if you’re right, let’s just say our, my deepest fear and your deepest fear is right, which is you run out of things to do what I still think is there. Every business me need support, every business, some size needs support to grow and needs help to unstuck problems. And there are a lot of problems to unstuck. Even if the solution isn’t always ai. Jesse Pujji: Just think of, here’s a simple way to think. Well first of all, let’s actually play a game. I just Googled or chat GB td this. How big do you think the, I just said how big is third party engineering as an industry? Yep. And everyone think about your answers, prices, right? Rule applies. Alex: Okay. Jesse Pujji: Andrew, you go first, Mr. Skeptical? Andrew Warner: Uh, I would say quarter trillion dollars. Okay, Jesse Pujji: so that’s 250 billion? Andrew Warner: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Okay, Alex, A Alex: year. Uh, 49 billion. Jesse Pujji: Okay. Armand, Alex: we all of third party engineering. So like dead shop external Arman: engineering. Alex: Yeah. Arman: Oh, over a trillion for sure. Jesse Pujji: All over the place. Okay. Well, the, the right guy was right. It’s, this has a reasonable ballpark is one two, 3 trillion annually. Woo. So, dude, it’s, it’s another way to think about it. Like, you think about these cloud services guys, Andrew, and like, they’re like, you, you, I think you’re getting so close to the problem. You’re forgetting the business need, which is like, why did someone need a Salesforce implementation shop? Well, the real reason is ’cause they needed A CRM. Well, why They needed A CRM because they needed to track their customers and manage their customers and follow up with their customers. Then they needed a software to do it, then they needed a service provider on top of the software to implement it. And so the point is, these things all have to start with business problems. And I think what Alex was saying before about McKinsey is, do you think businesses will stop having problems if your answer is no? Then they’ll continue to have a business in helping them solve their problems, which happens to be using that, the modality. Today’s ai, 20 years ago it was, it was cloud services, right? 20 years before that, it was like, we’ll put up your mainframe and your thing and we’ll do whatever you need there. And it’s gotten bigger as there’s been more and more stuff, and everyone’s using more of it. Andrew Warner: So are we all agreeing that AI transformation is the beginning of the relationship, but it’s not the long term business, and then at some point something needs to come up? You either become the person who, when the CEO is sweating in the middle of the night, they call you, as Alex said, or as Jesse said, you keep finding other things to do and either way, you’re the support system and you happen to be using software or whatever that Jesse Pujji: software is. Yeah. Or, or Alex, we’ve been spending a lot of time looking at the, like, as new tools and technologies pop up, there’s gonna need the equivalent of implementation businesses. And so someone’s gonna, some, some tool that we can’t even think of today is gonna launch on top of anthropic or whatever. Everyone’s gonna go, wow, that solves this one problem for me, that, you know, engages my employees. Now I need to eng engage, like I need someone to implement that for me, and so on and so forth. Sorry, Alex, Alex: what were you gonna say? I, I think mm-hmm. Andrew, to your question, I think AI is a tool in the toolkit that solves business problems. And ultimately, if you want to build a huge business, it, my view is, is it isn’t the only tool you’re gonna rely on. Andrew Warner: Armand told me early before Armand told me before we got started, there’s a lot of fomo. You hear that AI can transform, you call, uh, 10 x, you say, I heard it can transform. Go and look around my company and tell me what’s going on. And people will get a will, will then find ways to improve the business. That’s, that’s why this whole thing is so sexy in the beginning. Alright, I wanna do a few demos here. Can you both do a screen share and show me a few things here? Alex: Yeah, for sure. So first, um, what do you guys use to, do you guys use EOS? Jesse Pujji: We have, yeah, we use elements of it. Alex: Okay, cool. So something. That I always found, like I fe, so EOS, just as, just to give quick, uh, background, it’s like OKRs, it’s a business operating system. My whole thing is I don’t like thinking about the rhythm of running my business and the processes and I don’t wanna invent them from scratch. EOS is a system for running your business. Um, we at Morning Brew we self-implemented, meaning we read a book called Traction by Gino Wickman, and then we implemented what was talked about in the book. A lot of people hire actual implementers, um, who either run your offsites, help you with ES implementation and they charge a shit ton of money. Like, you know, they, they, it could be like $15,000 a day for being at your offsite or, uh, with implementation. So what I wanted to do was basically build an EOS implementer. ’cause I’m implementing EOS at 10 X right now. And so I’ll just take you guys through this quickly. So EOS facilitator basically built a custom GPT. And the way that I think about custom gpt is it’s, it’s basically just a, almost like a persistent chat GPT instance. So it’s the, you know, instead of me having a one-off conversation with chat GPT and then it falls into the abyss of all my conversations, if there’s a conversation that I’m going to want to revisit frequently. If it’s something, if it’s a tool that I’m gonna wanna share with other people in my business, and if I’m gonna want it to operate with context that like on an ongoing basis, then I think about building a custom GPT. So we look under the hood here in this E-O-S-G-P-T. Basically the way it’s configured is I have uploaded the actual book Traction by Gino Wickman. I found the PDF of the book uploaded that. I uploaded the VTO, like all of like the, the frameworks you fill out to, to implement traction. What I actually haven’t implo, uh, uh, uploaded here, but it’s something I’m gonna do is take our knowledge base for 10 x so our org chart information about our clients and upload it here. So then EOS has, or this implementer has full knowledge about our business. And then the instructions are basically the way in which this custom GPT is supposed to interface with me. And just for context, the way that I always approach creating these instructions is I just have chat GBT five PRO create a prompt. So I asked it to create a prompt that would act as kind of the instructions for my EOS implementer. And so just to give you an example of what this looks like in practice. Um, and, and, and also like in terms of the model, and this is something Arman and I talked about a, a bunch. I just used GPT five PRO on this. It’s like the most powerful model that GPT has. It takes longer, but it’s just very good at reasoning. So one thing that I was doing today with it is I wanted to create the accountability chart for 10 x. And so what I literally did is I just had a conversation with my implementer. So I said, can you help me create my accountability chart? Said yes. And then it took us through the di directions for creating the accountability chart. The accountability chart is like, what are the key functions in your business? It’s about, um, roles, not seats or people. And then it asks questions. And so what I like about this is it acts as like my facilitator. ’cause it’s just asking questions to gather information. Mm-hmm. To complete the accountability chart. So then I said, we’re 10 x, we have 12 team members. We have both visionary and integrator. Our core functions, our sales and marketing products and client success and ops. It fills those out. Then it says, do you have five key responsibilities per seat, which is what the accountability chart has. I had already created it, so I shared an image, and so then it just filled in what the roles per every seat were. And then it asked a few follow-up questions all and went through the full thing. We have a full accountability chart now, and then the next step is you look at everyone in your company and you look at are do they get it, want it, and have the capacity to do it? Like are they right for the roles you have in your company? And so then it created this whole table that now our leadership team at 10 X is gonna fill out to know of like everyone is right for their role at the company. So that’s just one example of how I basically turned traction the book and like all of the guidelines into my facilitator. Yeah, so this doesn’t have to be like a single player experience. And one thing I’ll say is I’ve found this very helpful because I am very much an external processor and so I find it way easier to have someone questioning me than me trying to, in my own head, self implement EOS. Andrew Warner: I’m like that too. I need that conversation and voice ideally. Alex: Yep. Andrew Warner: Okay. And I’m looking over on the left side of your screen, and I can see that you also have an AI coach, which I think is trained on another book, and Alex: Yep. This Andrew Warner: one was, you’ve done this for different aspects of your Alex: business. Yep. This one was, this one was trained on, um, Mabo, Charlie’s great. CEO within mm-hmm. And then also info about 10 x. So I, I actually use this all the time. Like we were just talking about, uh, Armand and I were talking about like, um, did we want to give a bonus to a certain employee? What should that bonus be and what are the trade-offs? We, I went through the conversation here and what it suggested is what we ended up going with, and it’s scripted what our conversation should be when we meet with that employee to share their bonus. That’s awesome. But set the right expectations. That’s, Andrew Warner: that’s fantastic. Yeah. Okay. Uh, Amron, you got a, you’ve got something you wanna show too, right? Arman: Alex mentioned, uh, developers are living in the future and the tool du like Jesse, earlier you mentioned Curs. Our engineers would call you a boomer for using cursor like that is like so yesterday. Um, and so love it. The tools that are like the big ones right now are Codex, CLI and Claude code CLI. Um, so to those who’ve never seen this interface or think this is scary, this is basically what’s called a command line interface. So if you’re on Mac and you open what’s called terminal, like you just go terminal, um, it’ll open. And then on Windows, I think it’s something similar, uh, term. If you search term, it’ll open. So if you, um, open up terminal and you download Claude then or Claude Code, which you could just do from the website, then when you type in Claude, it basically opens up this program, uh, called Claude Code. And so you could just talk to it. You could say, um, I am Arman, uh, or actually here, let me, who is Jesse Fuji? Did I spell that right? Andrew Warner: Mm-hmm. Okay. Arman: Uh, search. The web and give me a brief bio. So it basically goes and does some research and it says, okay, I wanna do web search. Jesse Fuge, bio entrepreneur. Yes. So this is like a very simple use case, but uh, we will get nuts in a minute. So, cool. Serial entrepreneur, blah, blah. Okay. Um, so let’s actually say, um, I want to build a competitor to am push. Alex: Oh shit. Arman: Um, please write me a business plan in a markdown document to do so. Start by doing research. Um, spin up at least three sub-agents running in parallel. One should study. And push and its competitors. Alex: Andrew Buckle. In Arman: another study, go to market Alex: business model to a third one Arman: and how we, uh, acquire customers. And the third should study business model. Use the internet to do that. Then come back and write the report. Cool. So first it’s like, let me understand what this guy wants, and then you’ll see in a moment it’ll spin up three. So this is one subagent research, aush and competitors. This is the second subagent research go to market and customer acquisition. And then this is the third subagent research business model options. And now each one is running. Each one is doing its own searches, as you can see. And I need to approve each of them. But you know what, I’m just gonna say yes. And don’t ask again for web search commands. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. I’m just gonna say yes ’cause it’s not listening again, Andrew Warner: because it wants to make sure that you, you’re comfortable with the number of tokens it’s using. Arman: Using, yeah. So you can change modes. So you can go to, I think it’s control shift or command shift or something. Shift, I dunno what it’s, but there’s some command where you can like change modes and you can go into planning mode where it won’t do anything. It’ll just write a plant. There is, uh, auto accept mode or like, we call it yellow mode where it just says, screw it. I’m just gonna, you, I’m not gonna ask you for permission, I’m just gonna do whatever. Alex: And, and just so you guys have context, like one thing I learned in just watching Armand and the different engineers work with Claude Code is the reason it was such a kind of like incredible, um. Like piece of software. And, and the reason also like was it sounded at 3.7 that was incredible is because of its ability to have tool use, like to basically access tools, external tools to do work. Arman: Yeah. Alex: And it was other models before this were not nearly as good as doing this. Arman: Yeah. Alex: Tools like what, Arman: like task like web search. Like it, so, so there is so much going be going on behind the scenes. There’s a lot of people who’ve like reverse engineered cloud code to understand how it works. There’s a lot of really cool techniques like injecting reminders to tell the agent, Hey, don’t forget this, whatever. It’s really, really involved, but it’s really good for, and that makes it really good for coding because it work, it, it basically forces the agent to stay on task, but that makes it useful for other things too. And that’s kind of one of my goals is to get people who aren’t engineers using this. So as this is going, I’m actually gonna show you another, another example. Okay. So this is still running over here in this window, but over here. I’m going to kill this. Clear it, and then I’m going to say Claude. Um, and I’m gonna say open up LinkedIn, uh, LinkedIn’s website or webpage. Open up LinkedIn. Why am I speaking? Why am I like being weird? Open up LinkedIn. Yes. I wanna proceed cools. Andrew Warner: So now open up, it opens up a tab in a new browser window. Arman: Yep. That opens up a tab in a new browser window. I’m gonna say search for Andrew Warner, founder of Mixergy. Okay. It’s taking a snapshot to make sure it did the right job, but as it’s doing that founder of Mixergy and send him a dm, tell him, oh wow, Alex: this was, Arman: um, or this was sent by Claude. So now. To, yeah, lemme try to manage these windows. So I’m gonna put them side by side here. Okay. So it’s asking, yes, I wanna proceed. So it’s gonna click on search Combox, but now that I resize that it needs to reorient itself and Alex: Armand’s using a tool called Playwright, which, which basically allows you to interface with web pages. Arman: Yeah. Which is actually, it’s, it’s an MCP. It’s super easy to install. Um, and it’s free. So anybody can do this. So now it’s going, it, it searched for Andrew. There Andrew Warner: he is. It found me right there. The one search result. Okay. Arman: Yep. That man is so handsome. Good looking guy. Jesse Pujji: The machines are alive. Andrew Warner: What Arman: Now? See, it’s saying message button for Andrew Warner. Andrew Warner: Because it identified the message about not its own. Arman: Yep, exactly. Andrew Warner: And knew that’s what it needed for the dm. Arman: And now it’s looking at it like it actually looks at the code. So now it just opened up the message window, see that? And now it just put, this was sent by Claude Code and to round out our magic trick, it’s gonna take a screenshot just so that it can wind up and it’s gonna send that, I’m really trying to buy time for quote code. Yeah. And now it’s gonna click the send button and it’s sent. So Andrew, if you can confirm, this is Andrew Warner: by cloud cloud code. It went through from Alex to me. Jesse Pujji: Where does all this go in, in your guys’ mind? Where does all this go? Like Armand, what’s the pace at which, I mean this stuff is obviously, it’s really cool, it’s a little slow if you’re trying to do something. It takes, it takes a long time. But what’s Jesse Pujji: gonna happen in like six months or a year in, in your opinion? Arman: So what’s interesting is that this example. Technologically speaking, this was possible over a year ago, right? Why is this not the norm? I would argue that it’s for the exact reason that like, for the exact problem that we’re solving, it’s hard to implement. Like this is a cool magic trick, but to understand how you implement this is actually difficult. So one of the things that, that Alex and I talk about a lot is when people argue, Hey, um, Claude Code or Cursor or whatever, AI is not as good as I am at writing code. That’s what a lot of engineers will say, but a lot of people outside of engineering will say similar things. They’ll say, ai, AI is not as good as as me at X, so I can’t use it to that. I say basically, if you have a free or near free junior employee and you can’t, and you have unlimited versions of this, you could spin up infinite. Numbers of these near free junior employees. If you can’t find a way to generate leverage from that, that’s a skill issue. Right? Jesse Pujji: Right. Arman: Now, if we take that curve and we take the cost of intelligence, I would argue that this is intelligence, right? If you take the cost of intelligence and you, and you ask them, tote that towards zero, what you see is people will 10 x or they will go towards zero. And it, and, and if you, if people have the ability to architect, right, whether it’s code and they wanna architect it, or in this case, if you are a really good recruiter and the only thing that was holding you back is your ability to message a ton of people or whatever it may be, if the only thing in the way of success was just time, you’re going to succeed. Jesse Pujji: But my, sorry, my question was a little different. Where do you see the technology going for like. Is this gonna happen in three, like in one second in the future now? Or like, is it gonna, I mean, that seems like to be the obvious thing, that it’s gonna go faster, better, smarter. Like how do you guys think about that? Alex: Yeah, I mean, if you read the, um, I’m forgetting his name now. Uh, we could LinkedIn in the show notes, but there was just a piece written by a guy who was a, is or was a researcher at one of the frontier labs. And he is like, everyone basically talks about how like the models are slowing down in their improvement chat. G PT wasn’t that good. And what he basically posits is like we as humans are just really good at getting used to things that felt like science fiction, feeling like nonfiction anymore. And the the, uh, the gold line just keeps moving in crazy ways, right? And you actually map out the, the, basically there’s these independent orgs that do a mapping of every new model basically. How long can the model run for? And still have a 50%, um, success rate of whatever the task was that it was doing. And when GBT three came out, I wanna say it was like, it was like three seconds or four seconds, Arman: right? Alex: And now it’s like, it’s at like an hour. And if you actually look at the charting of this, it is still exponential in how long that these tasks can run for. And the reason they look at that is it’s like entropy. The longer a task is, the more, uh, likely it is that a model will start, like spinning its wheels and all these things. And so if you just look at this like it is still exponential, and he would argue that basically you’re gonna be able to have a true digital employee, meaning it can do 24 hours a day of work without you checking on it by 2027. Arman: Yeah, I, I would be more bullish than that person. I would say that it’s actually much sooner. I think in terms of the, um. To nerd out on this for a moment. Uh, I think if the way, like if you think about this in terms of like using humans as an analogy, the base models are, are appearing to asymptote, right? They’re appearing to either asymptote or the growth of the speed of growth is slowing. Most of the growth now is coming at, whether it be the application layer or the fine tuning layer or whatever, or that type of like adding intelligence on top or adding ability on top of like core iq. And with the stuff that I just showed, like adding what I call arms and legs, right? And so like, if you want to use the human being as the parallel, the base model is basically a newborn baby. They’re born with a brain, but we need to spend a lifetime teaching that person how to be a human. They need to grow, they need to get coordinated, they need to be able to do shit right. And that’s what the models can’t do right now. That is make, that is happening much, much faster. I think that is the part that all the money and time and intelligence is going towards. So I think the next year raci a lot of, like when GPT-3 0.5 was first announced, they were advertising they could write a fucking haiku. Jesse Pujji: Right Arman: now we’re actually getting to the like, let’s actually do shit. Let’s get it to actually do work. And I think that that’s gonna accelerate over the next 12 months. Jesse Pujji: What’s your take on like human in the loop AI versus, I mean, again, there’s like this, some arguments like no, the humans are gonna be, you don’t need them. They’re versus human in the loop. Like how do you guys answer that or think about that? Arman: People think about AI as like something that’s out of our control. Like, oh, it’s inevitable that AI is going to take over because of course it’s going to, right? Like it’s the self-fulfilling prophecy. I think that what people forget is that it’s a statistical model that is in our control to make it better. Not only are we in control of making it better, but we’re in control of making it better in the ways that we want it to be better, right? And so if we as humans want it to be really, really good at something, it’s going to get good at that thing. By nature of free markets and intelligence and all these things, if we don’t want it to be good at something, it’s less likely to be good at that thing. And so I am not necessarily worried that humanity is going to replace ourselves because it’s in our control. I think I am concerned about different, like, like some people who run these giant companies, I don’t think care about the things that I’m describing here. I think they actually just wanna see how far AI can be pushed and how much humans can be replaced. But frankly, that’s part of why I was excited about like starting 10 x. That’s part of the initial essay that I wrote is to. Compete against that and to make sure that humans are in the loop, but in a way that we want to be in the loop. Can we think humans are put here Jesse Pujji: to create part Can, hold on. Mike, can you bring that down one level that the philosophical aspect of it makes sense to me? I’m curious, like there’s a version of this where, again, the future is so automated and blah, blah, blah. There’s another version where like, humans make the AI better through the things that make them human. And then AI makes humans better through like output and stuff. Like, do you believe that, how do you guys think about the, like, you know, again, there’s that AI won’t replace you. A human who uses AI will replace you. Like, do you believe that, and I mean that more, less from the, like your, your worldview and more from like a specific, the way work gets done with AI in the future now and in the future. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, my one thing I would say just specifically to the, the truism you just said is I really just think it is like bullshit and like basically every executive is like on one hand being like. How can I use AI in my company? On the other hand is saying, um, how do I make sure my people aren’t worried about it? And then behind closed doors is saying, this is a hundred percent gonna wipe out a ton of jobs in my company. Jesse Pujji: Right? Alex: Um, so look, I mean, Armand will have a smarter thought here, but my, my general view is like, if we view, like I view AI today as like this incredible junior employee that just like a great junior employee is high agency, high effort. You, uh, you delegate, uh, like you build up trust initially with like, really, uh, defining parameters. And as it earns trust, you allow it to do more without you checking in on it. As intelligence gets better and better, I do think you end up getting like employees, quote unquote employees that look more and more like senior employees, which just means like at the end of the day, what’s a job of an executive? It really becomes around like orchestration. And now where I’m not smart enough is. What is the point at which it becomes intelligent enough that it is good enough? It, it can orchestrate well as well. I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that and I don’t know if anyone does. I don’t know if you have thoughts on it. Like if your question is like, are we out of jobs, uh, in the next five to 10 years? IWI would put it at a non-zero chance, but until that point, we’re enjoying working on this problem. Jesse Pujji: How are you guys thinking about the framework for your margins and your growth as a services business? Arman: What do you mean? Like frameworks? Like what is our goal or Jesse Pujji: it’s a really, really important thing. So, so here’s, here’s what typically happens with services, businesses and how they go south, right? One is pipeline, like the amount of work getting done versus clients that are coming in like you’re selling people, right? And I don’t mean that in a weird way, but that’s what you’re doing fundamentally. And typically what happens is service delivery and customer acquisition, they start to bleed in a bad way, which means. Oh, like you have this pipeline, then the pipeline gets too busy because you still need to be involved probably in certain ways. And like then that’s one way you start to get into this, like this sort of swinging. The other big way that’s related is then margins, creep. Margins go down, right? And margins typically go down because scope creeps up by the client. You’re not, people aren’t paying attention to it all. Like I see a lot of services businesses where they’re just not even paying attention to it. I talked to an agency couple weeks ago and I was like, what’s your pod level margin? They’re like, we have no idea. What are you talking about? And they weren’t directly, they could do the high level number. Yeah. They could say, here’s the total revenue, here’s my total headcount. And then some clients are 10% margin and others are 70%. Yeah. And, and so there’s a lot of frameworks. I think that, you know, it’s important for you guys to build to, to crush this, uh, to start to think about some of these questions more directly. And I, maybe you have, maybe you haven’t, but, but that’s sort of just what I meant by that. Arman: I mean, we have the margin down to the day, like, like we know our margin per employee because we’re, we generate, we charge on output and we pay on output and everyone’s aligned. And so we’re very, very strict with, um, thinking about that. And again, the goal is so that we can reinvest in the company and, and um, and build IP for the customers. And so it’s basically that flywheel. So what Jesse Pujji: drives your margins up versus down? Alex: One is that every additional time we do work, there’s less human. There’s actually less cost of labor that goes into that work. That’s cool. Yeah. One, one example for that would be like, um, and this goes into like how we ultimately wanna monetize the business different than typically service businesses. What does it look like if Andrew, let’s just use an example for, um, I’ll, I’ll just use an example for let’s, we were talking to a business there, sellers spend. More than 50% of their time not selling. We are talking about building basically just like an A sales co-pilot for them that does a lot of like SDR and sales ops work. While this business is like a healthcare business, 90% of the bones of this agent can be applied to every other business that has a sales function. What does it look like for us to basically, one, build this agent at cost as 10 x and then charge them based on usage of the agent, but then also every additional time we work with customers, then potentially need, right. A sales agent build, it’s effectively Lego blocks for doing that over and over. Right. Right. And so the margin increases every time we do that. Jesse Pujji: No, I love that. Well, but, so one of the issues with output based pricing, right, just to flag it for you guys, is Yeah. What happens when the client, like, what happens when the output isn’t good and you’ve committed to the output, so all of a sudden you, you, you know, let’s say your costs are 50 grand. You’re selling it for a hundred grand in this example, and they go, we don’t like this. And you’re like, fuck, I gotta put another month’s worth of work into it for whatever reason. Client’s unhappy, maybe they’re jackass and they didn’t listen when you were scoping it and vice versa, whatever. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Then what happens is you spend another month and now all of a sudden your margins went from 50 to 30%. Alex: It really is just a question of is it realistic to fully incentive align you with a customer? Because if you were to truly incentive align, I guess it would be like truly value-based where it’d be like, if this outcome happens in your business, we get paid. And I know like the big consultancies do this. Um, I mean, I guess my question for you is like, do you, do you just think that’s not realistic for service businesses to charge based on value or, or output? Jesse Pujji: No, not at all. I mean, that’s what we did at Ambush, right? I mean, we charged that way. It’s just you have to build the infrastructure. There’s a lot of pieces that are, that require like more thoughtfulness than you might think. For example, like. One of the, one of the quotes, like Rick would always say, and this is in a marketing context, right? ’cause we would take on people’s marketing and we’d promise them better results. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right? And it’s like, well, at first you’re like, wow, these guys will take a risk. And they’ll, and it’s well, but what’s really happening is like, we’re like an investor, we’re underwriting the opportunity. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So, and, and the line was like, never, you know, be like, Floyd Mayweather, never take on a fight. You can’t win. Alex: Totally. Yeah. You just back the duck. Jesse Pujji: Yeah. Well, specifically though, in your, in our case, it was like we already knew the levers we would pull to be able to reduce their CPAs or grow their volume by a certain amount. And we didn’t always work, but we were very confident. More often than not, it would work. And so for you guys, when you think about costing based on outputs, what you’re gonna find pretty soon is you’re gonna want to narrow the things at, you start to focus on, like your example of the SDR thing. Because then, you know, you can keep delivering it, delivering it, it delivering it. And you’re gonna have a built in margin model versus the more wide, like Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You know, wide, industry wide problem set. That, that, that runs into that problem, which is like you, if you can’t start to predict it, it starts to really take a big hit on your Alex: margins. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, Alex: I think that, I think that makes total sense. One last thought, ’cause I know you, like, you basically talked about acquisition costs, um, and like delivery, moving the wrong direction. You know, one of the things that I’ve wanted to do since leaving Morning Brew is effectively build morning Brew on top of a better business model. And, um, and so ultimately the goal is to build kind of 10 X media on top of 10 x, where there’s only one place that executives go to to make AI more actionable. And that’s like the hook again. And over time, it can develop into not solely around ai. Um, and so that’s the idea is a combination of brand and personality driven franchises that make AI actionable for kind of the next generation of leaders that are trying to transform their businesses. Andrew Warner: Come on guys. Now tell the audience your revenue. Can we say more than 10 million? Alex: Sorry. Uh, Andrew, you’re cutting out. Yeah, Andrew Warner: it must be your connect. Cool. End it here. Gentlemen. Congratulations on the success. Thanks so much for doing this, Armand. I’m seeing you wince like you’re regretting the friendship we even had. Just because I’ve pushed it too far. I’ll win you back later. I’ve Jesse Pujji: got an awkward question for Armand. Why is this business not on your LinkedIn? It’s, uh, it’s going on there. Okay.

Time Published: 2025-11-05T19:30:06Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Bank of America’s annual spending on new, strategic technology initiatives, which includes investments in artificial intelligence, has increased by 44% over the past decade to reach $4 billion in 2025. The executive that’s steering those investments is Hari Gopalkrishnan, a 14-year veteran who was promoted to serve as the chief technology and information officer in late July. Today at Bank of America’s investor day event, Gopalkrishnan will outline the vision for these strategic tech bets and discuss how they tie into the broader $118 billion in tech investments that the company has made over the past decade. It is the first time leadership has held this event in 15 years and Gopalkrishnan, CEO Brian Moynihan, and other C-suite leaders will face investors as Bank of America’s stock has lagged the five other large U.S. banks for the past five years. “We have steadily increased our spend in technology, now up to $13 billion a year, of which $4 billion goes into strategic growth,” Gopalkrishnan tells Fortune ahead of his one-hour investor day panel discussion with two other Bank of America technologists. “We leverage across the enterprise, so every dollar you spend gets the maximum bang for the buck, as opposed to sort of being siloed by line of business.” That means that when Gopalkrishnan deploys new AI tools and functionality, he will prioritize applications that can scale across all eight lines of business, which includes global capital markets, consumer lending, and retail banking. One example of this in action is Erica, an AI virtual assistant that’s surpassed three billion client interactions since the tool launched in 2018. It now averages more than 58 million interactions per month, facilitating chatbot conversations with clients, proactively altering them on changes to their past spending patterns or flagging when they may have been double-charged by a merchant, and answering banking questions. The tool is currently available on Bank of America’s mobile app, but will expand next year to the desktop. In 2020, Bank of America launched Erica for Employees, an internal version of the tool that more than 90% of the company’s global workforce of 213,000 now uses regularly. Erica has helped reduce the number of calls into the company’s IT service desk by 50%. The banking sector has embraced generative AI capabilities at a faster pace than most sectors, with investments focused on AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants that can summarize financial documents, fraud monitoring, and assisting employees as they navigate complex international regulatory changes. Generative, predictive, and other forms of AI collectively are projected to generate as much as $340 billion annually in value creation for the global banking sector, consulting giant McKinsey has estimated. Financial giants, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, have also been steadily rolling out new generative AI tools to more employees throughout 2025. At Bank of America, Gopalkrishnan says he’s less incentivized to focus his investments on AI tools that can save a couple minutes on simplistic workplace tasks. “When you look at the end-to-end client journey, they involve like 40-plus processes and thousands of employees,” says Gopalkrishnan. “You start to pick apart that process and reimagine it. That’s when you get ROI.” Bank of America has explored more than 45 different “proof of concept” use cases for generative AI , with 15 of them commercially live today. Some of the priority use cases that Gopalkrishnan is deploying include tools that can summarize or offer search functionality for capital markets and investment banking employees, making it easier to pull real-time market commentary. An in-house built “AskGPS” tool, which was trained on over 3,200 internal documents and presentations, allows employees to ask complex questions on behalf of clients and receive responses within seconds. Bank of America has also invested $1.5 billion into the company’s data capabilities over the past five years, which Gopalkrishnan says was critical to create a foundation that allowed for more AI adoption. Within the technology department, Gopalkrishnan has deployed AI coding assistants that are used by 18,000 developers. There has already been a 20% productivity lift to select parts of the development life cycle that Bank of America has focused its efforts on. Gopalkrishnan says he’s mostly leaning on one unnamed vendor to support AI-enabled code assistance, but is continuing to explore other tools on a smaller scale. His intent is to standardize the application of these AI coding tools over time to as few vendors as possible. More than 130,000 Bank of America employees are currently authorized to use the enterprise productivity tools and by the end of the year, everyone will have access to them. Bank of America has sought to motivate its workforce by offering AI learning programs that begin by teaching the basics of AI, but also more advanced prompt engineering training. “It’s really a combination of training, education, giving them exposure to the tools, and then ongoing commitment to reskill, as the work changes,” says Gopalkrishnan. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech earnings highlight cracks in AI’s valuation halo. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all spent billions to support their AI initiatives—and all four told investors last week that they will increase spending even more in 2026. Investors have consistently supported the AI boom over the past few years, though that enthusiasm showed some notable cracks in the latest earnings season, as Microsoft and Meta Platforms both saw their stocks fall amid concerns for the lofty levels of spending needed to support their AI ambitions. What’s vexing investors is: AI is generating billions of dollars in revenue and bottom-line efficiencies, but exactly how much, at what pace, and at what price? That investment thesis still needs time to marinate as these tech giants have added debt to support their AI spending. OpenAI strikes a big compute deal with Amazon; projects massive revenue growth. On Monday, OpenAI inked a deal to buy $38 billion worth of compute from Amazon and will immediately start to access Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The partnership is notable as it is one of OpenAI’s first big moves away from Microsoft, who the AI startup had an exclusive cloud agreement with up until this year. Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated more bullish expectations for revenue growth, sharing that annual revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year. When asked by the Bg2 Pod about revenue estimates exceeding $100 billion a year by 2028 or 2029, Altman responded: “How about ‘27?” Nvidia makes history as the first-ever company worth $5 trillion. Last week, AI chipmaker Nvidia officially became the world’s first company to achieve a market capitalization north of $5 trillion, pulling ahead of tech rivals like Microsoft and Apple, who are each worth close to $4 trillion. The latest stock market gains came after Nvidia’s GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang disclosed that the company had secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of next year. Major new deals that have been unveiled the past several days have included partnerships with Eli Lilly, Uber Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Sundry Photography / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) delivered a massive earnings beat this morning, but the stock is selling off in premarket trading anyway. That’s the tension worth watching right now. Uber reported Q3 earnings this morning with EPS of $1.20, crushing the $0.70 consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $13.47 billion, missing expectations of $13.54 billion by $70 million. The stock declined 9% in premarket trading to $92.25, suggesting investors are focusing more on the revenue shortfall and guidance implications than the headline EPS surprise. Trips and Bookings Drive the Momentum The real story here is operational velocity. Gross bookings reached $49.74 billion, up 21% year over year. Trips increased 22% YoY, marking what CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called “one of the largest trip-volume increases in the company’s history.” Monthly active platform consumers grew 17% YoY, indicating consistent user expansion across the platform. Both segments showed strength. Mobility revenue hit $7.68 billion, up 20%, while Delivery revenue jumped to $4.48 billion, up 29%. Adjusted EBITDA expanded 33% YoY to $2.26 billion. Free cash flow reached $2.23 billion, a signal that profitability is translating into real cash generation, not just accounting improvements. The $70 million revenue miss is modest in absolute terms but meaningful in context. With gross bookings accelerating and trips surging, you’d expect revenue to track higher. The gap suggests either mix headwinds (lower-margin business growing faster) or pricing pressure in core markets. I’d keep an eye on this during the earnings call. What’s not in doubt is margin expansion. Operating income hit $1.11 billion, and net income reached $6.63 billion. That includes a $4.9 billion tax valuation release benefit, so strip that out and the underlying profitability picture is still strong. EPS: $1.20 (vs. $0.70 expected)Revenue: $13.47B (vs. $13.54B expected); miss by $70MGross Bookings: $49.74B (vs. implied ~$48.7B); up 21% YoYAdjusted EBITDA: $2.26B (up 33% YoY)Free Cash Flow: $2.23BTrips: Up 22% YoYMonthly Active Platform Consumers: Up 17% YoY The adjusted EBITDA growth outpacing revenue growth shows operational leverage kicking in. That’s the metric that justifies the current valuation multiple. For Q4 2025, management guided for gross bookings of $52.25 billion to $53.75 billion, representing 17% to 21% YoY growth on constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.41 billion to $2.51 billion implies 31% to 36% YoY growth. The company also noted a 1 percentage point currency tailwind expected to boost Q4 growth. The guidance range suggests confidence, though the revenue miss today tempers enthusiasm slightly. Khosrowshahi’s commentary leaned bullish, emphasizing investments in “lifelong customer relationships,” local commerce expansion, and AI and autonomous vehicle potential. The tone was optimistic but not reckless. You’ll want to listen for clarity on the revenue miss. Was it mix shift, pricing pressure, or timing? Also watch for any commentary on competitive dynamics in core markets and how the company plans to sustain delivery growth, which is now outpacing mobility on a percentage basis. The path to $108.88 (current analyst price target) depends on whether margin expansion continues without sacrificing volume.

Title: Denny's to go private in $620 million deal for the 72-year-old breakfast chain

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 4, 2025 / 10:59 AM EST / CBS/AP Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors. The deal, announced Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises. Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday. Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading. Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus. Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box. Treville Capital is an investment firm whose chairman is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and former president of the Walt Disney Co. Denny's reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. Valade said Denny's board believed the deal announced Monday was in the best interest of shareholders and the best path forward for the company. "Denny's is an iconic piece of the American dream, with a renowned brand, a strong franchise base and loyal customers," said Rohit Manocha, co-founder at TriArtisan, in the statement. Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022. If approved by Denny's shareholders, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Trade talk between US and China helped calm Markets - Tech and Health Care deals over weekend - Earning season continues The trade truce that was established last week between the US and China is having a positive effect on the markets in today’s premarket trading. We saw the Asian markets with a positive reaction overnight (although Japan was closed for a Holiday) and the S&P500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures Contracts are all positive in premarket trade today. The major Indices are hoping to build on the momentum of last week and last month. In the month of October, we saw the S&P 500 up approximately 2.5% and the Nasdaq up just under 5%. In what is often a tough month we had an uneven but positive reaction the positive news that we received from Amazon.com on Friday certainly helped us finish on a strong note. As mentioned, we have positive signs in premarket trade, but we also have some deal news that could also help drive markets higher. We had news that Microsoft Corporation announced that they have entered into a contract with IREN Limited, for $9.7 Billion that will allow Microsoft Corporation to have access to NVIDIA Corporation Chips. The five-year contract will include a 20% prepayment and is clearly being viewed positively by the Market. In premarket trade we have both stocks higher, with IREN Limited up by over 20%. We also have a deal in Health Care area, with Kimberly Clark Corporation purchasing Kenvue Corporation which is the parent company of Tylenol. The cash and stock transaction will value the Kenvue franchise at $48.7 Billion. This is a weekend with lots of news coming into Monday, but there are still some other things to keep our eyes on that will move markets and some things we will talk about for the rest of the week. The first thing is to not forget that we are still in the height of earnings season and with that there are some favorites of Retail Traders reporting this week. That starts today with Palantir Technologies. We see the options market is pricing in an expected move of about 2% for the move after earnings on a stock that has doubled this year. We also have Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday, and all will be waiting to hear more about their recent deals, particularly more about the details on the Oracle Corporation deal. The other major earnings on Monday and Tuesday include Uber Technologies, Shopify Incorporated and Pfizer incorporated The government shutdown continues and besides the human toil and effect of this, we are also seeing companies starting to suffer because of this with the Airlines front and center, as we are starting to see the delay times at airports continue to stack up and companies waiting on approvals for things from the government having to wait while this is settled. We also and news from OPEC+ group this weekend as they announced that they would halt planned production increases at the beginning of 2026. The price of Crude Oil is largely unchanged in premarket trade. We do have some numbers this week, the non-delayed numbers include ISM Services and Consumer Sentiment. Plenty of opportunities this week, as always, stick to your trading plan and long-term goals

Watch CBS News November 2, 2025 / 7:32 PM EST / CBS News Editor's note: On October 31, 2025, correspondent Norah O'Donnell spoke with President Donald J. Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., and this is a transcript of that conversation. They started by discussing the president's recent meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, we get along great, and we always really have. We had the COVID moment, which was not-- attractive as far as I was concerned. I wasn't so happy. But outside of that, we have always had a great relationship. He's a powerful man. He's a strong man, a very powerful leader. And-- we've always-- had the best of relationships, probably the best of-- I could-- I think I could speak for him, just about as good as it gets from his standpoint and from my standpoint. And having that is important because of the power of the two countries. NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you get out of this deal that you wanted? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I got sort of everything that we wanted. We got-- no rare earth threat. That's gone, completely gone. We have tremendous amounts of-- dollars pouring in-- 'cause we have-- very big tariffs, almost 50%. We never had anything in terms of tariffs, although I put tariffs on China, but Biden let it lapsed by the-- by the fact that he gave exemptions on almost everything, which was just ridiculous. But-- we have-- billions and billions of dollars coming in, and we have a very good relationship. I mean, we have-- a great relationship with a powerful country. And I've always felt if we can make deals that are good, it's better to get along with China than not, if you can't make the right kind of a deal than not, because, you know, China, along with many other countries (they're not alone in this), they've ripped us off from day one. They've ripped us so much. They've taken trillions of dollars out of our country. And now they're-- it's the opposite. I mean, we're doing very well with China, and hopefully they're gonna do very well with us. But I do think it's important that China and the U.S. get along, and we get along very well at the top. NORAH O'DONNELL: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: As you mentioned, they were-- China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones to-- to build submarines. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- what was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiatior-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, when you say hurting-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --is President Xi-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because-- I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, "You know, we have to fight back." And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and-- and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. Now we are. I mean, we have tremendous rare earth, and it's going to be-- you know, it's going to be-- it'll be a strength, but it won't really be a strength if everybody has it. Everyone's gonna have it pretty soon. And they were doing it-- on a singular basis. Now-- they use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have-- hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting-- maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, "Look, if you don't open up, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying." And as soon as I said that, they came to the table. We met in South Korea, as you saw, right? A lot of people watched. And-- we made a really good deal. And it was good for them also, I hope. I mean, I want 'em to be good for both sides, but-- we'll be takin' in hundreds of billions of dollars-- in the form of tariffs. You know, tariffs are incredible, because they really give us great national security. As an example-- when they pulled the rare earth on us and the rest of the world, if we didn't have tariffs to fight back, I-- I immediately instituted a 100% tariff over and above what they were already paying. And when I did that, they immediately came to the table. Without tariffs, we would not have had that privilege. We would have-- not have had that right. Tariffs give us national security and great wealth. NORAH O'DONNELL: You talked about those rare earth minerals. Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: --I-- my understanding is about 90% of them come from China. That's their-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right now. NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But within a short period of time-- we'll have everything we need for ourselves. You know, we've instituted an emergency program, and we will have-- within a year from now to a year and a half, we'll have everything we need, no matter what kind of a threat is being-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How? How do we do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because we've taken over. First of all, you saw the partnerships w-- we've established with Japan, with Australia, with U.K., w-- with just about everybody, frankly. And we're all doing it together. You know, this wasn't a threat against the United States. This was really a threat against the world. So the w-- whole world has come together, I think, at our behest. And rare earths, in-- within two years, rare earths will cea-- really cease to be a problem. NORAH O'DONNELL: The one thing that China wants but it doesn't have is the world's most advanced semiconductors. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's what the United States has. Will you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Chips in particular. NORAH O'DONNELL: Chips. That's right-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you allow the chip maker, Nvidia, to sell their most advanced chips to China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. No, we won't do that. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's not on the table at all? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we will let them-- deal with Nvidia. Nvidia's the prime-- company in the world for that. And we will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced. The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because then they would win the AI race. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they wouldn't win it necessarily, but they would certainly have-- an equal advantage. Right now we're winning it because we're producing electricity like never before by allowing the companies to make their own electricity, which was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of. These massive plants that are being built are building their own electric generating plants along with the plant itself. And that gives them all the electric they need without going to an old grid that's, you know, 150 years old. And-- they're makin' it-- themselves, and then they're selling back any excess electricity into the grid, so we benefit in all ways. But most importantly, it allows the c-- the companies to go immediately forward. We're getting-- approvals done in two and three weeks. It used to take 20 years. And we are leading the AI race right now by a lot. We are leading it by numbers that people have no idea. It's been-- it's been really great. We've been very, very far-reaching for it-- th-- look, that's the new internet. That's the new everything all put together. The AI race is a big deal. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yep. NORAH O'DONNELL: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: They play the long game, including on our own soil. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We play the long game too. NORAH O'DONNELL: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And-- we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's-- I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just-- knocking them out-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Hmm. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --of the economy. They can produce things that we don't want to produce because it's not really worth our while-- making-- undergarments, makin' this-- you know, certain things. We don't want to do that, and we can buy them inexpensively from other places in the world while we can lead the world in AI, and chips, and lots of other things. Within-- two years from now, we'll have 40% or 50% of the chip market. What's happening here, the biggest companies are leaving Taiwan. They're coming into the United States because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: In how many years? You think we'll be producing-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think in two years, we'll start opening up plants and we'll have a very substantial portion of the chip market. Right now we have almost none. We should have had a hundred percent. If we had par-- if we had presidents that knew anything about business or knew what they were doing, because, frankly, they didn't. We lost 50% of our automobile business. It's all coming back. We lost a hundred percent of the chip-- you know, it used to be all Intel and other companies. And what happened is other countries came in, and they stole our chip business, and we didn't charge tariffs. If we would have charged let's say a 100% tariff, none of those companies would have left. But they all left. Now they're all coming back, Norah, because the only way they avoid the tariffs is to build in our country. If they build in our country, make their plant and make their product in our country, then it's a very simple thing. They-- they don't have any tariff to pay. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's what they want to do. And so instead of charging somebody a 100% tariff and you can make your product outside, they come in, and they make-- and this is why we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now. By the time it-- it-- just to show you how big that is, it's the biggest in history by many times. No other country's been any-- seen anything like it. The Biden administration in four years did less than a trillion. We have 17 trillion-- more than $17 trillion right now, and I'm in my ninth month. By the time we finish up, I think we're gonna have over $20 trillion invested in the United States or to be invested in the United States-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How will that trickle down to the average worker? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because of jobs, because they're building plants. W-- we're bringing back the auto industry into our country. We lost 58% of the automobile manufacturing business to other countries. You know, we used to be the king of automobile and automobile manufacturing, and now we're not really the king anymore, you know? Within a year and a half, two years, we're gonna be the king again. We're gonna-- the-- the-- as an example, I was also in Japan, as you know, and South Korea. We had-- the biggest Japanese companies are investing billions of dollars in building auto plants in the United States. If I weren't elected-- if I weren't elected, we would be losing all of these jobs. We would be losing far more of the auto industry. We would be nowhere in chips. Our country would have been bankrupt, and we would have had a bigger welfare roll. They would have expanded welfare and forgotten about everything else. Now we're building a country that's gonna be so strong, I don't know if you saw the last numbers in terms of employment. They're all non-government jobs. Not just government. Government jobs are easy. I could-- I could immediately inc-- do anything I want with government jobs. I'd just say, "We're gonna add up-- we're gonna add on a million government jobs," and you're gonna say, "Oh, what wonderful numbers." They don't mean anything. We are building jobs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But when all of these plants that are currently under construction and to be under construction, when they open, we're gonna have an economy like our country has never seen before, the strongest economy in the world. We're doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit-- perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It's hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my-- nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We're doing really well, and everybody knows it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's put it this way-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I-- can I ask you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people know it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people definitely-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --on that point, though? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It does. Oh, it does, it does. NORAH O'DONNELL: But there have been-- grocery prices are up-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But-- but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly. So the beef-- the ranchers have really taken a drubbing over a 30-year period. Because of what I've done, the ranchers have done well. But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden. All of these problems were caused by Biden, whether it's-- the people that came into our country through jails. I mean, they were released from jails. They were lease-- released from mental institutions into our country. These problems are caused by Biden. We had an open border. Now we have a border that's, as you know, absolutely shut other than-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --people are allowed to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. NORAH O'DONNELL: I do want to talk about immigration and some other- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --domestic issues. But just-- if we could stay on China for just a moment-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why not say it-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Taiwan is a very interesting case. It's 69 miles away from China. We're 9,500 miles away. But that doesn't matter. He understands-- what will happen. He and I have spoken about it. But it was never even brought up during a two and a ha-- or two-and-a-half-hour meeting we had yesterday. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, "He understands," why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I don't want to give away-- I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens. The other side knows, but-- I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's gonna happen. And-- he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, "We would never do anything while President Trump is president," because they know the consequences. NORAH O'DONNELL: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --immediately. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why do we need to test-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --our nuclear weapons? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to-- and the reason I'm saying-- testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I wanna be-- I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test. We have tremendous nuclear power that was given to us largely because when I was president (and I hated to do it, but you have to do it)-- I rebuilt the military during my first term. My first term was a tremendous success. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. But my second term is blowing it away. It's blowing it away when you look at the numbers, the stock market, the jobs. Look at the job numbers, how good they've been. And, again, I have costs down. Remember, Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- I w-- definitely want to talk about the economy, but I just want to make s-- sure we-- we button up this issue-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --on nuclear weapons. And I want to clarify this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Russia's-- no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it. NORAH O'DONNELL: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the-- delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w-- not with nuclear warheads- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report-- they don't have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do. No, we're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing. NORAH O'DONNELL: Not nuclear weapons, is my understanding-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course they have-- NORAH O'DONNELL: North Korea has, but not nuclear weapons-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They-- they test way under-- underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make-- a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China-- and China does test, and we're gonna test also. NORAH O'DONNELL: So we are going to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't it sorta make sense? You know, you make-- you make nuclear weapons, and then you don't test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Apparently, we don't need to test our nuclear weapons, 'cause they're the best in the world, according to experts I've spoken with-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: According to me. We have the best, and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about. But if other people are gonna have 'em, we're gonna have to have 'em. And if we have 'em, we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them. And in the meantime, I've solved eight wars. I knocked out eight wars. I had eight wars-- I brought a little list for you if you'd like to see it-- but I took eight wars and stopped during an eight-month period, during eight months. Before the ninth month I stopped eight wars. The only one I haven't been successful yet in, and-- and that'll happen, is Russia Ukraine, which I thought actually would be the easiest one because I have a very good relationship with President Putin. But-- we are respected again as a country, and that's the way I've been able to stop the wars. I also stopped them because of trade. NORAH O'DONNELL: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Both tough. Both smart. Both-- look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not-- they're not walking in saying, "Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice." These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders. NORAH O'DONNELL: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine, that being the one war that you are not able to solve. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in-- Alaska. But there's been-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. But is-- but there's been no ceasefire-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I made-- yes, there isn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What's—is he ignoring you? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because he thinks-- because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. He even said that. That was a war that would've never happened. Joe Biden was the president. Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons, which allowed them to fight, 'cause we make the best weapons in the world. You know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. They used a lotta those weapons in that war. We make the best weapons in the world. Now we make even better weapons. But that was-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So why won't Putin end this war? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that was-- but-- but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war. That should not have been a war. That would've never happened if I were president. And by the way, for four years it didn't happen. There was never even a doubt. Then the election was rigged and stolen, and all of a sudden you see them forming up at the line. And now I come back and I'm gonna get that one solved too. But I brought, I mean, just a little list of-- of-- look at this, wars. How many did I solve? Cambodia-- this is Cambodia Thailand. Kosovo Serbia. Congo-- the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, that was gonna be a beauty. They shot down seven planes. Israel and Iran, you've heard about that one? Egypt and Ethiopia, that's another beauty. Ethiopia built a big-- dam where there's no water going to the Nile. Armenia and Azerbaijan. And if you take a look, Israel and Hamas, which is a, you know, rough little situation, but it's gonna be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I do wanna talk about-- I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I did-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --pretty good. I-- I solved-- those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I-- NORAH O'DONNELL: When-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, "If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not gonna be able to do business with the United--" NORAH O'DONNELL: So why isn't that-- why isn't that working with Putin? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of-- foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. That's what I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you get it done in a couple months, do you think? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the U.S. But it did work with India, and it did work with-- Pakistan, and it did work with-- 60% of those countries. I can tell you, if it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals. But I stopped, as an example-- India does a lotta business with us. They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan. The-- Prime Minister of Pakistan stood up the other day and he said, "If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now." That was a bad war he was ready to start. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Shot down airplanes all over the place. That really-- that was gonna be a bad war. And I told both of them, I said, "If you guys don't work out a deal fast, you're not gonna do any business with the United States." And they do a lotta business with the United States. And they were both great leaders, and they worked out a deal, and they stopped the war. That would've been a bad war. It would've been a nuclear war. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna stay on the issue of foreign policy, and let's turn to our hemisphere. There have been at least eight boats in the Caribbean destroyed by the U.S. military-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately. NORAH O'DONNELL: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs-- they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons-- they emptied their prisons into our compan-- country. They also-- if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums-- into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But why is our aircraft carrier-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just finish. NORAH O'DONNELL: --going down there? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. We had the worst inflation, we had the worst of everything. But the worst thing he did was allow millions of people to come into our country that were many-- in many cases, criminals, murderers, 11,888 murderers were let into our country. Venezuela let a lot of those people in. But they were from all over the world. This isn't just Venezuela. They were from all over the world. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are gonna talk about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And what he did to our country should never be forgotten. He had an open-border process, and people would come in, and I'm not discriminating against tattoos, but people would come in with tattoos all over their faces, and say, "Come on in, come on in, come on in." They let people in that should've never been. Venezuela emptied their prisons into the United States of America. And every one of those boats that you see shot down-- and I agree, it's a terrible thing-- but every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: We will talk about immigration in a moment, but I just wanna talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to 60 Minutes as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think so. Look-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it about-- let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well we don't need to blow up boats in order to deal-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, okay? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero-- think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. And it was millions of people a year just a little more than a year ago. Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We had no idea who they were. And we're never gonna let that happen again. That's what made Biden the worst president, because you know what, inflation I've already taken care of. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country, and now we don't have inflation. It's at 2%. It's-- it's the perfect inflation. NORAH O'DONNELL: Aren't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But what made him so bad-- well, the weaponization of law enforcement, all of that. Look, he was bad in every way. But the worst thing that he did is allow millions, and millions, and millions of people to pour into our country unvetted, unchecked. And they were criminals, they were murderers, they were drug dealers, they were people from jails, and people from mental institutions. NORAH O'DONNELL: You-- you have had success on immigration, I wanna talk about that in a minute. But on Venezuela-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Big success. NORAH O'DONNELL: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't tell you that. I mean-- I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I-- you know, I wouldn't-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Why would we do it? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But-- because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm gonna strike. I'm not gonna-- you know, you're a wonderful reporter, you're very talented, but I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Why do we need an aircraft carrier and all of group--strike group-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gotta be somewhere. It's a big one. NORAH O'DONNELL: I just think it-- it leads to the suggestion that the United States military is planning a larger operation involving Venezuela. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not gonna allow countries from-- what-- you know, it's countries from all over the world coming in. You know, they come in from the Congo where we just settled that war. But it come-- they come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular-- has been bad. They have gangs-- Tren de Aragua, do you ever hear of it? NORAH O'DONNELL: Of course-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The most vicious gang anywhere in the world. They cut people's hands off if they call up the cops. You know, they call up the police and they said, "Did you call the police?" "Yes, I did. You took my apartment, you live in my building, you took my apartment." They cut his hand off. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: "Don't ever call the police again." NORAH O'DONNELL: I fully underst-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are animals. Wait a minute. And they came in from Venezuela. Worst gang-- probably the worst gang, most vicious gang in the world. And you know what I did? In Washington, D.C., we had a lot of 'em. We took care of business. They're gone. Washington, D.C., right now is a very safe place, as it should be. Washington, D.C., be-- before I got here was almost like a crime capital of the world. It's the capital of this country. To me, it's the capital of the world. You see the way they treat me. I go to Japan, I go to South Korea, I go to Chi-- any place I go, and you know what I call that? Respect for our country. They didn't treat Biden that way. When Biden went there-- first of all, he hardly went anywhere. Guy couldn't leave his bedroom. But they didn't treat Biden that way. They had no respect for Biden falling up the stairs going to an airplane three times. I mean, this is a man who should've never been president. This was a rigged election. And we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --have to get back-- we have to get to the bottom of that also, because we don't want that to ever happen again. You see what's going on. We don't ever want that to happen again. Look what happened to our country by having Biden as the president. NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country went to hell. And if we-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about Israel-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --had another couple of years, if Kamala had won the election, our country right now would be finished. It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it's only gonna get better. NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about Israel, as we're on foreign policy and talking about some of your successes. You got-- on Israel, you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not fragile. It's a very solid-- you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're gonna be taken out immediately. They know that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: How do you get Hamas to disarm? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be-- they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are gonna be tough. But we were tough also, and they let 'em all out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You were tough-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, by the way, they're getting-- a lot of the bodies are coming out too. Did you know a lot of the parents-- this is very interesting-- were-- the people that lost their child, you know, mostly sons, but sons and daughters, they knew they were dead, in some cases. Do you know that they were as anxious or even more anxious of getting their child out, even though they knew it was a body that we were dealing with, than the people that had a living child-- a living, breathing child that they knew they were alive, if-- if barely, because the way they lived was so horrible. And-- you saw yesterday four more just came out. We're gonna get them out too. They're buried in many cases. They're buried under rubble. But we pretty much know where they were. But I didn't get just the 20 out. I got all of the hostages out. NORAH O'DONNELL: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize-- to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's-- he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I-- I did a great job in pushing-- he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that-- has never been pushed before, actually. And that's the kind-- that's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should-- you know, we'll-- we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. But he's a wartime prime minister. I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped-- you know, I-- we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. Iran wants to make a deal. They don't say that, and they probably shouldn't say-- no good deal maker would. But Iran very much wants to make a deal. The key to Middle East peace-- I made Middle East peace. For 3,000 years they couldn't do it. I did it. And I did it with some very good partners in Israel. But the key to the Middle East peace was knocking the hell out of their potential-- nuclear. When we, with those beautiful B-2 bombers-- we just ordered 20 brand new ones, the newest and the greatest-- but with those beautiful B-2 bombers, when they went in there and they blew the hell out of that, you know, potential nuclear weapons site-- there were two of 'em, actually. And every single missile hit every single air shaft. You know, they had to go down an air shaft. Every single one of 'em hit their target. And I remember fake news CNN said, "Well, maybe it wasn't as powerful or as good as we thought." No, it was much-- turned out it was actually better. You know the Atomic Energy Agency said the hit was even stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And those pilots did a great job. What they were able to do-- and those machines. But it wasn't only them. They were surrounded by F-22s and F-16s. They were surrounded by F-35s. They were-- do you know we had 52 tanker planes, loading 'em up with jet fuel, because it was a long flight. They flied-- they flew for 37 hours. Of course, I flew for thirty-- 42 hours over the last three days, so I know how they feel. But they flew-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Except there's a bathroom on Air Force One-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --but they were sitting in one seat. I was-- I was able to walk around a little bit. But yeah, they said 42 hours. I've been in the air for 42 hours over a few days-- and that was fine, because we took in trillions of dollars into our country. And we also-- you know what's interesting, Japan took tremendous advantage of us over the years. You know, they sold cars to us, we couldn't sell cars to them. They made a fortune, we didn't make anything, we lost money. But it's the exact opposite now. But you know what? They like us more now than they used to because they respect us now. They didn't used to respect us, and they have great respect for us, all of 'em. Every country has-- including China. China now has great respect for us. They didn't have respect for us when they had Biden and when they had Obama. Obama was a terrible president. Nobody wants to talk about it because they wanna be politically correct. I don't care. He was a terrible president. Our country was-- it really started a very bad downward spiral. Then I stopped it, then we had a rigged election, and then-- what-- what Biden did to our country should never, ever be forgotten. NORAH O'DONNELL: We're still on-- on foreign policy, so I just have another question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm with-- I'm on all policy. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know you are-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about foreign-- no, no. I'm talking about everything. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, I just wanna-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm talking about economy, I'm talking about everything-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: --this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think he's gonna join. I-- I think-- we will have a solution. I don't know if it's gonna be two-state. That's gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me. But-- look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you wanna know-- do you wanna know-- they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you wanna know that-- the pilots, I invited them to the White House-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines, these big, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful wings that carry massive 100,000-pound bombs, and you don't-- I personally-- I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. They're-- they were beautiful-looking people. They were-- they're real-- I mean, they're real American heroes, and I thought they deserved to be invited. And I invited 'em to the White House, the Oval Office, including the mechanics and the people behind the scenes, I invited-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a lot of 'em. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, "Sir, for 22 years we've been practicing this route. Our predecessors," obviously, before them-- but "our predecessors and ourselves, for 22 years we've been practicing this hit, three times a year, every year, for 22 years. And you were the only president that let us do our job." I said, "Let me ask you. Is this a job you wanted to do?" "Yes, sir, 'cause it was the right thing." These are really brave people. These are really amazing people, and talented people. When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded and beat the hell out of it, I'll tell you what, they deserve to come to the White House. I gave 'em all a medal. They deserve to come to the White House. And it was a pleasure to meet 'em. These are great people. We have great people in this country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, we've talked about foreign policy, now let's focus on issues here at home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: --some of that you have already mentioned. We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats' fault. NORAH O'DONNELL: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, "Give us an extension, we'll work it out." They don't wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for him, but the polls are turning around because-- not turning around. I just saw a poll where they're down 20-25%. What's happening is the people understand they're losing so much, they call it Trump derangement syndrome. They are losing so much that they don't know what to do. They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, "Let's vote." And you can open the-- the economy could open up during our interview-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do, though-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe it did. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All I can do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to bring this to an end? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is give the facts. Here's what I can't do. I can't give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally. So that prisoners, and that people from mental institutions, and people that are drug dealers get vast amounts of money for healthcare. That I can't do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So my under-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I can do is I can continue to run a great country. We have the best economy we've ever had. I can continue to do that. What they should do-- look, this started a long time ago. I always said-- and you know I've been very consistent-- Obamacare is terrible. It's bad healthcare at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. But, you know, people are gonna get an 18-19% increase in Obamacare. It was a faulty program, it should've never been approved. But it was approved. NORAH O'DONNELL: So now that we're in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we fix it it'll be-- one of the greatest achievements. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But if ending the government shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country-- and you know what they have to do-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So your plan-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of ''em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote the-- to end the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Correct, very simple. NORAH O'DONNELL: And that you will put forward a healthcare plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We will work on fixing the bad healthcare that we have. Right now, we have terrible healthcare and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people. NORAH O'DONNELL: But Mr. President, with all due respect-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people are paying-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --you've been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. We were one vote short. And coupla Senators that we currently have made the mistake, and they-- they made a big mistake. John McCain made a mistake, frankly. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. And I've been saying ever since, "We can fix it. It's too expen--" it's got two things. It's too expensive, and it's lousy healthcare. It's too expensive for the people. They're gonna get a very big increase this year. And it's because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they're gonna get an increase if they don't-- if you don't extend the subsidies. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But the subsidies is part of it. We're supposed to spend trillions of dollars to take care of something that-- that is defective. What I'm saying is, we can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better healthcare. And I'd be-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --willing to work with the Democrats-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --one Republican would ever do that. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just button that up? Because the extension of these Obamacare subsidies, if they are not extended is that's what the Democrats are pushing for. I know you understand that. Tens of millions of Americans will see their monthly payments double. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. It's going to double-- NORAH O'DONNELL: That's a lot. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --anyway. It's gonna double anyway-- NORAH O'DONNELL: My understanding is, it's just the...but can I-- may I just-- my understanding is, if those healthcare subsidies are not expan-- extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if the subsidies are not extended, they're not gonna be able to afford health insurance-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. It was a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president, not nearly as bad as Biden, by the way, who by the way is building a museum that's, like, four times over budget. It'll never open, built in a neighborhood that-- you know, it's just not gonna work. The neighborhood doesn't even want 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's a disaster. The same guy that did his museum, which is a total catastrophe, came up with a bad healthcare plan. And for the sake of one vote, we would have had, you know, it's so sad thinking back-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But how-- I guess the question is-- I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had the vote, that one vote, we would have great healthcare at a much lower cost, and that's what I want. But I don't want to give $1.5 trillion to prisoners and drug dealers and-- and the people that-- that came into our country from mental institutions. What they allowed to come into our country, and we're getting 'em out, but what they allowed to come into our country, Norah, is horrible. So-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I just-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can make it good. NORAH O'DONNELL: I don't want to get into a back-- too much of a back and forth on this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but here's all I have to do. Open up the country. Open up the country. NORAH O'DONNELL: You mean, end the shutdown-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We only need five of the-- of their votes. We only need five votes, and already a couple of Democrats, a few Democrats are already voting. They want to open up. And we'll fix all of those problems. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're st-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those problems are much easier than what I just did with solving all these wars. NORAH O'DONNELL: Last question-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had-- wait a minute, we had nine wars on our planet. I solved eight of 'em. I have one to go, Russia-Ukraine. I thought that was gonna be one of the easier ones but it's not because Putin is tougher than people thought-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You have-- you-- you have helped these government shutdowns in the past when it came about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did. NORAH O'DONNELL: And you did it by bringing back-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm very good at it, but I'm not gonna do it by-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You brought members of Congress to-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I'm not gonna do it by extortion-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --to the White House. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The-- there's something wrong with these people. NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November 15th-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer-- Schumer is a basket case. NORAH O'DONNELL: --when the troops don't get a paycheck? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer is a basket case. He's gonna be defeated in the next election by a vast number of people. And he has nothing to lose. He's become-- I just left Japan. He's become a kaz-- kamikaze pilot. This guy-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like-- it sounds like this is not gonna get solved-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is, this guy is a kamikaze. He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well. But the people don't want that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It's, I know, I hear you. It sounds like-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So we have a record-setting country right now, and we're not gonna be extorted by a man who's grossly incompetent, who-- who is gonna be defeated by any one of five different candidates. We're not gonna let that happen-- NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like this is not gonna get solved. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it? NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like it's not gonna get solved, the shutdown. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gonna get solved, yeah. Oh, it's gonna get solved. NORAH O'DONNELL: How? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're gonna have to vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they have to. I mean, look, I-- I use the word kamikaze, not freely. I don't like to have to use that word. They are kamikazes, but there are gonna be four or five Democrats that come. We need five. They're gonna come and vote. NORAH O'DONNELL: That's-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster. NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you see John Thune said today they're not gonna do that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know John doesn't-- well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not gonna lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what? NORAH O'DONNELL: So you think John-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't-- I don't even know-- actually, I don't even know his attitude on the filibuster, but I think we should do it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He j-- he said today he wasn't gonna do it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's too bad. You know, I mean, I think we're much better off. 'Cause here's the problem. The Democrats will do it in the first week in office. The Democrats, and I told that to John. The de-- and I get along with him great. We've had a great relationship-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Yes. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I also know there are other Republicans that feel the other way. And I understand that too, but they're wrong. The Democrats will do it. If they get into power and someday I guess they will. Who knows? It's hard to believe when they have men in women's sports, open borders, open everything, a transgender for everyone. The Democrats will do it in their first day in office, and the only reason they didn't do it is because of Sinema and because of a man named Joe Manchin from West Virginia-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Senator Kyrsten Sinema--. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --good man. And they disagreed with it. Now wait. Had they approved it, I think just one of 'em, had they been able to get those votes, you would have had the nuclear option used. You would have had the filibuster ended, and the Democrats would have used it. So I say to the Republicans that want to be, you know, all like, "Oh, well, we-- you know, we're above all that," the Democrats will do it. See, the Republicans have much better policy. We have smart policy. We have great policy. That's how we win. The Democrats are vicious. They're vicious. They have horrible policy, but they are the most vicious human beings on Earth. They are people that weaponize government. They do a lotta bad things. But-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the good thing is, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of winning is, they have the worst policy of-- it's hard to believe. Think of it. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. I mean, I could go point-- these are not 80:20-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --these are 99:1 issues. And they don't change. I just watched this morning a show where-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I ask you about the-- the economy-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, just-- just one thing. I watched a show this morning where a very well-known Democrat Congressman was fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. They don't change it-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Who was that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell. You'll be able to check it. Just check your local TV. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is gonna hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Supreme Court right now. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very close rulings, yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that-- and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had 401(k)s. Because of tariffs, I've ended six of the eight wars that I've ended, and it'll end up being used also for the last war in a different way. Because of tariffs and the economy, but because of tariffs, we have a great economy. Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again. Because of tariffs, tremendously good things happened. Because of tariffs, our country is respected again. Because of tariffs, a president-- NORAH O'DONNELL: So what if the Supreme-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute. Because of tariffs, President Xi allowed us to win every single point. He bought billions and billions of dollars of-- of our soybeans, of our everyth-- it was the money they're spending. When I came out, did you see what happened with the farmers? They're having rallies for Trump right now because of tariffs. Because it gives us national security. If we didn't have tariffs, and remember this. Tariffs are used against us. Let me talk about that lawsuit. That lawsuit against us was instituted and backed by foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. They don't want it because they were rippin' us off for years. And if we lose that lawsuit, they'll continue to rip us off and you're not gonna end up with a country. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. If they don't-- if they take away the power of tariffs from us, and it has to be quick and nimble, you can't have Congress, well, hundreds of people have to look. They can't even agree to continue a country. You can't have Congress here. This has to be quick and nimble. As an example-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you just-- finish that sentence. You said, "If they take away my power to do tariffs," what? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It would be a very sad day for the United States of America. We're making a lot of money. We're respected again all over the world. We have great national security. Let me give you an example. With China, they were, you know, very strongly threatening us frankly with the rare earths. And then I said, "Well, if you're gonna play that card, I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on over and above what you're already paying," which was 55%, which was very high. A lotta money coming in, tremendous money like we've never seen. "I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on everything over and above." And you know what happened? We got a phone call 20 minutes later. "We'd like to talk." If they take away the right to tariff, if they-- if-- if we're forced to use Congress to approve, they can't approve anything. They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs. If they take-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You want that power. You want that executive power. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure-- tariffs are national security. If you take away the right to tariff, and remember this. NORAH O'DONNELL: And-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tariffs have been used against us. NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you just answer that question that tariffs have led to inflation? They have led to an increase in cost of living for most Americans-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't led to inflation. We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn't have tariffs. He didn't use tariffs. NORAH O'DONNELL: For the average American-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why he didn't use 'em? 'Cause he's not smart enough to use 'em. NORAH O'DONNELL: But the companies say they passed on more than 30% of these costs to the American consumer off the tariffs-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, ready, are you ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: Somebody has to pay for it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. You have to pay, but we don't have any inflation. Inflation is the que-- is the real test of paying. Everybody said, "Oh, if you do tariffs, you're gonna have inflation." So Biden had the highest inflation in the history of our country by far, okay. No tariffs. I have very modest tariffs compared. Let me tell you. These tariffs ultimately are so good that at some point when they're used properly, and I use them more properly than anybody's ever even dreamt possible, think of it. We become rich. We're taking in trillions of dollars. And I have no inflation. And I have total national security. When I put the 100% tariff on China over and above what they were already paying, which was about 55%, so 155%, they came to the table immediately and they made a deal with us that was a very fair deal. That's called national security. And then I didn't make 'em pay the 100%. That would have been instituted. That would have come to fore on November 1st. Norah, Norah, listen to me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know our time with you is limited. I hear you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I didn't have the power of tariff, we would be-- we would be like a subject nation. We'd be subject to everyone else. Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate-- we would be a third world nation. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through another-- more of these topics. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: Immigration. I mean, you campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did great job, don't you think? NORAH O'DONNELL: --and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. Want to ask you about this. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the-- by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We've been held-- NORAH O'DONNELL: You're okay with those tactics? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions. I feel badly about that, but they're released from insane asylums. You know why? Because they're killers. NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's what I'm-- oh we're doin' that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --rapists. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what we're doing-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --farmworkers. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, look, look. NORAH O'DONNELL: The family of US service members-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: But was it your in-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We-- and we want to-- we focus on the bad ones, and we've gotten tremendous numbers of bad people. Don't forget. NORAH O'DONNELL: The-- there-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you have over 11,000 murderers released into our country, over 11,000, 50% of which have murdered more than one person, we gotta get 'em outta here. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're gonna go out. However, you've also seen, you're gonna go out. We're gonna work with you, and you're gonna come back into our country legally. Because we have a lotta good people. We have some great people. But, you know, the problem we have, and people don't like talking about-- these are very-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But there isn't-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait. These are very smart countries. Their leaders are very smart. They're very street-wise. They might not have gone to the finest schools, but they're very street-wise. They want-- they don't want, they have good people. They want people that are bad out. So they, what do they do? They open their jails. They let 'em out. They get rid of their drug dealers. They let 'em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren't working. In other words, they have people that just don't work. They don't want people that just don't work, so they put them into our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: But if someone has been in this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we've accepted all of these people because of Biden's open border policy where people would walk in totally unchecked and unvetted, murderers and everybody else. NORAH O'DONNELL: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was ten or-- I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. Many of them. But we're-- we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals. When I look at D.C. now, you can walk down the middle of the street. You can have your daughter who's ten years old meet you at the park. She's gonna be okay. NORAH O'DONNELL: In certain parts of D.C.-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She woulda been murdered. Well, I-- in almost-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I live in D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you tell me-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Certain parts of D.C. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How big a difference is D.C. now compared to what it was a year ago? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right? I mean, you have to be honest with me. People walk-- people in the White House, they walk up to me, young ladies I've never seen. "Sir, thank you very much." I know-- I-- they don't even have to tell me what they're thanking me for. But when I ask why? He said-- she-- one girl said, "I'd get into Uber and I felt dangerous even in an Uber." They'd attack the car, okay. It wasn't even safe then. "Sir, I now walk to work every day and I walk, I-- I-- I-- I'm so safe. I f-- there's nothing going to happen. 100% safe." And you know that too, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about the s-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You live here. You know that too. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about amer-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --American cities-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You see a difference? NORAH O'DONNELL: --in Washington, D.C.? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes. NORAH O'DONNELL: I think I've been working too hard. I haven't been out and about that much-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's not a fair answer. You see the difference. NORAH O'DONNELL: I get in my car and go to work and I go home-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good. You don't have to use that one. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to embarrass her. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've been working too hard-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's-- it's like you know what the difference is? Like, day and night. NORAH O'DONNELL: I want to ask you more about some American cities. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. NORAH O'DONNELL: We are about-- we're on the eve a number of big state and local elections. One of the most watched is the one for Mayor of New York City. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL:. . . he is, Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old Democratic Socialist. He's the front runner-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Some-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --he's far worse than a Socialist. NORAH O'DONNELL: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I'm a much better looking person than him, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Well, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who you know is campaigning for mayor, he recently said that "If Mamdani becomes Mayor of New York City that you will take over New York." Cuomo said this. He said, "He will be President Trump and Mayor Trump. He's gonna take over New York and send tanks down Fifth Avenue." PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What if Mamdani becomes mayor? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time. I got to see de Blasio, how bad a mayor he was, and this man will do a worse job than de Blasio by far. And it's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other, but if it's gonna be between a bad Democrat and a Communist, I'm gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, "If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard." What does that mean, send more than the National Guard? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right? NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Do you know that we have a place called Chicago that, with a very bad governor. They threw him outta the family business. He became governor. Do you know that 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship. 4,000 people were murdered during his governorship, and yet he won't let us bring in the National Guard. He won't let us bring in-- in Chicago-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But when you say, "Send in more than the National Guard," what does that mean? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, more would be Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. NORAH O'DONNELL: So you're gonna send the military into American cities? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. Do you know how many presidents-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you-- what would be the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. NORAH O'DONNELL: What would-- what would cause you to do that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? NORAH O'DONNELL: Tell me. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Almost 50% of 'em. Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? Twenty-eight times. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. I haven't chosen to use it, but if I-- because I've done well without it. But if I needed it, I could do it. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that. NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna ask you about-- another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is this political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You mean, do you think it's bad that I went after a public figure? NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it political retribution? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. I got indicted. They indicted the President of the United States. You know, they impeached me twice and I got out of it quickly and easily? They impeached me twice. These people are scum. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Terrible. I just won the case against her. She wanted me to pay $500 million for something I didn't do anything wrong on. And the judge just overturned the-- the decision. So and then you-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Have you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait. And then you tell me about me. Just so you understand, you say I went after these people. These people are bad people. They're dishonest people. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, I was just asking, is it political retribution-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And Comey's a dirty cop. Look, Comey's known as a dirty cop. I'm not known as a dirty person. They indicted me many times, indicted me. They were after me. I'm lookin' at you now. I'm President of the United States. I went through numerous indictments and two impeachments. And you tell me that I went after people? These people are dishonest. Look. Biden didn't have a clue. He illegally used, as you know, a machine, the autopen in order to give pardons to people. The only pardon he signed it looks like was his son, Hunter. He signed Hunter's, so, "Hunter, you're free, con-- congratulations, Hunter." But everyone else, I think those pardons are all just, were just a waste of time. Those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute, those pardons-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did I what? NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doin' a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automatically. But they instructed them to go after me, because the records now have been found. So when you tell me about I went after Comey, Comey's low on the totem pole. They went after the President of the United States. Do you know that they raided my house in Palm Beach, Florida called Mar-a-Lago? They raided my house. I had 78 or 98 FBI agents with arms-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I know how you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --come into my house. And you're telling me, Norah, that I went after some low-life named Comey, who's judged to be a crooked guy. He lied all over the place. He lied to Congress and did many other bad things. NORAH O'DONNELL: But I was just asking, has this-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: For that, you should be ashamed. NORAH O'DONNELL: No, no. I was just asking, is this-- is this retribution on your part? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. But even during my term, on a perfect phone call, I got impeached. This call was perfect. Tim Scott, from South Carolina, highly respected, a legitimate person totally legit, he read the tran-- thank goodness we had a transcript of the call. The call I got indicted on, a call on Ukraine of all places, with the President of Ukraine. It was a perfect phone call. Tim Scott said, "I just read the transcript. The President didn't do anything wrong, was perfect." And that was the end of the indictment pretty much. But I had to go through a whole process. You know, the Democrats knew that I wasn't guilty, because they didn't know the-- the call was-- I didn't know either, the call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call. When they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, "You made me go into this mess." She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like Schiff, et cetera, et cetera. So what happened is, she went nuts and just to conclude, and they said, "Let's do it anyway." They did it anyway, and I won very easily as you know. But you can't then accuse me of weaponizing government. They were horrible human beings. They went after the President of the United States. They went after my children. They went into my wife's-- drawers. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They went into my wife's closets. They held the dresses up. She came back. She said, "Oh, what happened? What happened?" 'Cause she's a very meticulous person. Everything's nice and neat. NORAH O'DONNELL: I've heard you talk about it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All of a sudden, everything's, like, they went into my office. They took things that I was allowed to have file-- under the Presidential Records Act that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have 'em. Only the president's allowed, but I was-- and it was nothing very significant anyway. There was, like, nothing. Wait, just one second. They opened these-- I'm a very meticulous person too. I have files, beautiful. They took the files, threw 'em all over the phone-- all over the floor. They were all over the floor-- and they took pictures of 'em. This is my office. I said, "What the hell? That's not my office." They took files, they threw 'em all over, and they took pictures and they released 'em to the public that this is "President Trump's office. We caught him with all of this stuff," like it was all over the floor in my office. These are crooked people. These are the same. So don't ask me about, "Did you go after?" Letitia's-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Letitia James, in my opinion, and I only say in my opinion 'cause I guess the lawyers would prefer that I say that 'cause I have a much stronger opinion, she's a total crook. She's a low-life. Comey's a dirty cop. Bolton actually helped me a lot because he was crazy. He's the one who want, him and-- and Cheney, a couple people got Bush to go out and blow the hell outta the Middle East and then take-- you know, then leave. And actually, Bolton helped me 'cause every time somebody saw Bolton standing behind me, foreign countries, they conceded. You know why they conceded? 'Cause they said, "Bolton's a nut job. Trump is gonna take us to war." But I don't listen to people that are stupid. Go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: And I know my time is-- is limited with you so I want to be respectful of-- of you, Mr. President. The issue of political violence I want to get to, because you were nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania. Charlie Kirk. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yup. NORAH O'DONNELL: Was assassinated. Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro's house was firebombed. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh-huh. NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota lawmaker murdered. What's your message to those on the left and the right who would seek to commit acts of violence? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think primarily on the left. A little bit of both, but I think primarily on the left. I think they have to tone it down. I think they have to approve the shutdown so it's not shut down. I think it's very bad what they're doing. They're hurting people. You know, if you think about it, if people aren't gonna get paid, there're gonna be, you know, a lot of angry people out there. They want to get their food. They want to get the money so they can live. In some cases-- whatever they want to get, they want to get. I think by the Democrats not giving us the votes, I think it's-- I think it endangers both parties. I think it's very bad. There's never been a case like this. This is, you know, this is fairly standard stuff. You do auto-- extensions are almost automatic. In fact, they were virtually automatic. This is the only time they don't want to do the extension, because they're losing so badly that they said, "Maybe we have some leverage." One of the Senators said that. "Maybe this is the first time we have some leverage." NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they really don't have leverage, because-- NORAH O'DONNELL: I wonder if we're at a breaking point? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the Republicans can't be extorted in order to ruin our country. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you feel like we're at a breaking point? Given everything that you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. NORAH O'DONNELL: --just said? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Because you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, over-- over history? NORAH O'DONNELL: Well. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's been much worse. NORAH O'DONNELL: Sure, but the political violence that, you know, we just outlined. The number of-- of members of people in public that have been targeted-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's-- that's a different question. Yeah, I think-- NORAH O'DONNELL: --that have been targeted. And then I just read that there's now a number of your cabinet secretaries and aides who are now living on military bases. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Usually when people talk they're not the problem. It's the ones that don't talk, in terms of that. But-- yeah, I-- I think it's-- it's a lot of the rhetoric. Look, they call me a Nazi all the time. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite. I'm somebody that's saving our country. But they call me Nazi. They have talking points, you know? They have just talking points. And the press is-- is largely responsible for it. The fake news, what they've done-- I think one of the greatest terms I've ever come up with is fake news. What they've done to our country is very bad. They have to change around. Now, nobody believes the fake news. Nobody believes 'em. I mean, they've gone, you talk about popularity, you talk about approval, their approval numbers have gone f-- from, like, in the 90s to in the teens now. We need borders. We need fair votes. And you really need a fair press. If you-- and you do, you have some great journalists and great reporters. But you have some terrible, terrible, dishonest journalists. And I see it all the time, because I'll give 'em a story and they'll have it. Even my trip with China, it was so successful. But of all, the Wall Street Journal, they said, Trump Lowers Tariffs. That was the headline. Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't what happened. I lowered tariff-- tariffs in order to get everything that anybody could possibly dream of. The point wasn't lowering tariffs. I put up a high number, I cut it, and I got everything. And yet the headline in the Wall Street Journal, beautiful picture of myself and President Xi, everything nice. But the headline was Trump Lowers Tariffs. That wasn't the story. The story was Trump got everything, got everything. Including world peace. We're respected as a country. We're not threatened right now. And we're not gonna be threatened. As long as we have a strong, smart president, we're never gonna be threatened by anybody. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well. NORAH O'DONNELL: --Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not gonna try and run for a third term? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't wanna use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. We're talking 3 and ¼ years-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do like J.D. Vance. I like-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Or secretary-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Marco Rubio. I like-- I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. We could run two people together. We have a great bench. So I don't wanna start talking about elections. It's too early. One thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged. And a lotta people say when it's rigged you're allowed to do it again. It was rigged. And it's been caught. And they-- and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it's coming out now in spades. But with all of that, we have a great bench. We have unbelievable people. You could go up and down my cabinet, we have great people. They don't. They have a guy that's ruined the state of California, ruined it, destroyed it. And I have a lotta property out there, I can tell you they've ruined the state of California. He has been terrible. Other than he's got a good line of--bullshit, that's all it is. He's ruined the state. And he's one of the people running. Jasmine Crockett, she's a low-IQ person. They say she might run for president, Jasmine Crockett. This is a very low-IQ person. AOC, I watched her speak the other day, almost the first time she was screaming. She was like a crazy person. Her-- she's got-- not a good speaker. Doesn't have, I don't think, but you never know what it is. You never know what it is c-- that can spark an election. When Joe ran first time I thought he was terrible. He was horrible. I-- I won by a lot. The second time he was running he was doing very poorly, he had a bad debate, and they replaced him in the middle the election. That never-- this could only happen to me. They replaced him with somebody, the press got behind her. Oh, they were so behind her. But eventually she failed because she couldn't speak. She wasn't a very intelligent person, in my opinion. But she couldn't speak properly. She could not speak. And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don't have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not-- you have a great-- I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, 'cause the young woman that's leading your whole enterprise is a great-- from what I know. I don't know her, but I hear she's a great person. But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me-- a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening. I see-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Because, you know, what we've done, what we-- I inherited a mess. And I've fixed it, other than it will take a while to get all the criminals, the real criminals, the ones-- the real bad ones, out. But we've gotten a lot of them out. We've gotten a lot of the murderers out. We've gotten a lot of the people from jails out and we've taken 'em back to their countries. In some cases they're so dangerous that we've actually had to put them in our jails because we didn't want 'em coming back. I wanna just keep it going pretty much the same way. I want safety in our cities. Our cities are a mess. And I hate to say it, they're Democrat-run cities. If you take the top 25 cities, they're almost all-- almost every one of 'em is run by Democrats. NORAH O'DONNELL: And to people that say they're-- struggling with the cost of living, expenses-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, cashless bail-- NORAH O'DONNELL: What could you do about that-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just say, cashless bail is a disaster. It's gotta be changed. Sanctuary cities really have to be changed. They're sanctuary, you know what they're sanctuary for? Criminals. Things-- some basic things have to be changed. But one of the things I really have focused on is making Chicago great again. Making-- and we're just getting started in Chicago. But what we did in D.C., where we took D.C. from being so bad to so beautiful, such good-- the restaurants are booming. You can't get into a restaurant. They were closing and now they're all opening every-- you can't get a restaurant now. You can't get into a restaurant. But you c-- if you wanna buy a restaurant or-- or own a restaurant you almost can't find it. I wanna make this happen all over the country. I want it to be like that in New York, in L.A., in Chicago. I wanna do it as much as you can. You know, by the way, Memphis, we're there now. Memphis was a dangerous hellhole. 65% down in crime. And this is after two weeks. We can do it all over the place. It's turned out to be a new passion for me, making our city-- I had no idea we could be that successful. I thought it would take a much longer period of time. Do you know in Washington, in 12 days it was really good. In one month it was close to perfect. NORAH O'DONNELL: And for those that are suffering with cost of living increases and saying they're living paycheck to paycheck-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd be very upset with-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Prices are up PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Biden. Because we don't have any of those problems. We-- we don't have inflation. You know, essentially we don't have inflation. We-- I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country. We don't have infl-- we're down to 2%, even less than 2%. A couple of items like beef I'm getting down. But our groceries are down-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Healthcare-- healthcare premiums? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can fix healthcare, give them better healthcare for less money. Obamacare is-- is hurting people. Obamacare was a disaster from day one. I can fix it and make it good. I'd really rather start with a fresh plate, but if it's-- if it's required to keep it, we can make it much better. But it's bad healthcare, and they're gonna get big increases, and that has nothing to do with me. That has to do with the fact that it was originally put into play. It's a shame. But we can make it better. Energy is way down. You know, you're gonna have $2 gasoline very soon. Nobody could believe it. You were at $4, $5, $6, and even $7. Look at the cost of gasoline in California. What it was, I brought it down. The problem is when I bring it down here in California they put more tax. They-- they tax the gasoline to such an extent. No, we're in great shape. This country is in great shape. We're ready to really rock. As I say often-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you-- are you-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we were a dead country. We were a dead country one year ago. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Leaders have said that to me. Just recently they said that to me. Even President Xi, he said, "I'd like you-- you to be congratulated." He said it so beautifully. "I'd like you to be congratulated on the incredible job you did in bringing back the United States of America." President Xi said that to me. NORAH O'DONNELL: I know we're out of time, but just on that matter, we talked about that-- because I know how closely you follow the stock market. Do you worry about an AI bubble? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess. I worry about everything, you know? I mean, you know, I'm a worrier. I worry. But you know what I do? I worry and then I fix it. I fix it. That way I don't have to worry. NORAH O'DONNELL: There's a lotta money behind AI-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lotta money. And right now I'm taking advantage of it, because we're leading AI. You know, we're leading it by a lot. China's in second place, but we're leading it by a lot. We have the greatest minds of any country anywhere in the world, and we're using that. I'm using those great minds to help us. Now, will something happen later? I guess, you know, something. But it could also be something very good happens. And I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected. Our country is doing great. We're strong. We're solid. We've never been-- I think we haven't been like this in-- maybe ever. Maybe ever. We have a great country, and you should be very proud of it. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you very much for your time-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL:Thank you. NORAH O'DONNELL: Do I have the opportunity to ask you two more questions? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If you want, if it helps-- NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Okay. Two more questions-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That means they'll treat me more fairly if I do-- I want to get-- It's very nice, yeah. Now is good. Okay. Uh, oh. These might be the ones I didn't want. I don't know. Okay, go ahead. NORAH O'DONNELL: Is everybody ready? NORAH O'DONNELL: This is a question about pardons. The Trump family is now perhaps more associated with cryptocurrency than real estate. You and your son-- your sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have formed World Liberty Financial with the Witkoff family. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Helping to make your family millions of dollars. It's in that context that I do wanna ask you about crypto's richest man, a billionaire known as C.Z. He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money laundering laws. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. NORAH O'DONNELL: Looked at this, the government at the time said that C.Z. had caused "significant harm to U.S. national security", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt. And what I wanna do is see crypto, 'cause if we don't do it it's gonna go to China, it's gonna go to-- this is no different to me than AI. My sons are involved in crypto much more than I-- me. I-- I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry. And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence. But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He's highly respected. He's a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it. I said, "Eh, it may look bad if I do it. I have to do the right thing." I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him. Maybe I did. Or, you know, somebody shook my hand or something. But I don't think I ever met him. I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration. NORAH O'DONNELL: The government had accused him of "significant harm to U.S. national security"-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's the Biden government. NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. Allowing U.S. terrorist groups to, you know, essentially move millions of dollars around. He pled guilty to anti-money laundering laws. That was in 2023. Then in 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But he got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can only tell you that-- NORAH O'DONNELL: He got a pardon-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Norah, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government. And they're good-- my one son is a number one bestseller now. My wife just had a number one bestseller. I'm proud of them for doing that. I'm focused on this. I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government. It's a corrupt government. Biden was the most corrupt president and he was the worst president we've ever had. I only care about one thing. Will crypto be-- will we be number one in crypto? Crypto has turned out, and in that sense I've been right. Crypto's turned out to be a massive industry, if you wanna call it that. And I'm very proud to say that we are far and away ahead of China and everybody else. Now, China is getting into it very big, right now. If you wanna go after people, you're gonna kill that industry. And it'll be very bad. Tremendous number of jobs. I campaigned positively on crypto, very openly. I campaigned. Biden campaigned against it. When Biden found out that I was getting, like, 100% of the crypto vote, which was a lot, he switched totally and he went in favor of crypto. They were totally in favor. They had many people under indictment. They let 'em all go. They let 'em all go. You know that. Many people were under indictment. Biden was a corrupt president. Biden went all in on crypto at the very end because he thought he could get some votes. It didn't work. They voted for me. I wanna make crypto great for America. That's the only thing. I don't wanna have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto. Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two. And right now we're number one by a long shot. I wanna keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way. NORAH O'DONNELL: So not concerned about the appearance of corruption with this? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't say, because-- I can't say-- I'm not concerned. I don't-- I'd rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, "Can I ask another question?" And I said, yeah. This is the question-- NORAH O'DONNELL: And you answered-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda walked away. I didn't have to answer this question. I'm proud to answer the question. You know why? We've taken crypto-- NORAH O'DONNELL: But just generally speak-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We're number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They're fighting like hell to be. But we're number one in crypto because I'm the president. Biden wanted to also, at the very end, you know, he totally switched his thing. You know, Biden was totally in favor of crypto at the end. Do you know that many people that were indicted under Biden for crypto, at the very end before the election, were let go? You know why? He wanted the vote. We are number one in crypto and that's the only thing I care about. I don't want China or anybody else to take it away. It's a massive industry. NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. (01:13:50) Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.
