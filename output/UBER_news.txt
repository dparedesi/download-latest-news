Challenging technology to serve the public good. The company behind more than a dozen dating apps, Match Group, has known for years about the abusive users on its platforms, but chooses to leave millions of people in the dark By Emily Elena Dugdale and Hanisha Harjani The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th. When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape. She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda. What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare. After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. Because it turns out moving fast and breaking things broke some super important things. She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge. Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people. Match Group’s official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.” So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police. None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place. Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested — the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group. On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented. “It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity. Matthews’ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered. Match Group’s reach is so massive — its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” — that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends. But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets. In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness. Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say. Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release what’s known as a transparency report — a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released. Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we only publish where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?” No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth. “The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.” The same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.” Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app, Tinder. Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data. In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate. Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping — and assaulting. Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same. The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe. “We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.” The company said it vigorously combats violence. “We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise. Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts. Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details. To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts. In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,” the statement said. Sept. 28, 2020 — the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge — is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy. Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then-CEO Shar Dubey said. Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals — from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides. Working for an Algorithm An investigation by The Markup found that Uber is slow to respond to law enforcement requests, leaving drivers vulnerable to repeated attacks Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company. In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.” Breeden’s team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data. She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record. During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team.” Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “The Avengers,” even donning superhero costumes at company events. But Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater.” Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts. Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,” he said. A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s computer listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.” These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps. “I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re gonna get worse. …I’m hoping dating sites vanish.” Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team, and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OkCupid was doing. Each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.” Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other. Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained — and expensive — investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps. OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious — like sexual assault — a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Group’s apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profile’s IP addresses, photos, and birthdate. Such a system seems robust at first glance — but none of the Match Group’s apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app. Lawrie’s team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much. So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned — even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported. Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault,” abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public. Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools. A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing. As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.” Lawrie used that report to protest. “Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.” Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas. He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that they’re not in the business of protecting users. “You’re on your own pretty much,” he said. As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps. One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face. Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks you’ll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose. By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’ profile. As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.” In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like “FarmVille.” While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value. Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned. While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn — users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers. In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees — not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations. Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once. Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden — a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield. Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door. Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks. “You’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation. Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas. Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews. Some women described him as “sketchy.” Others called him “terrible” and “not safe.” Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted. The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist. The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub. As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps. Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group — and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it — would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could — and would — continue to match with. The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021. During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced. Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in a searing blog post. After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.” Privacy Internet-connected cars allow abusers to track domestic violence survivors after they leave The “etc.” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package,” a curated list of “high-quality profiles.” It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews. In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency. This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal.” After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down. As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a “Share My Date” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app. But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews — a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home — from finding and harming women. Four years after Matthews’ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members. “Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’ arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.” Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed — with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done.” It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorney’s Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group. Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark. Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., we’ve just scratched the surface. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with you — or with Congress. The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this — and now so do you. Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting. Statistical journalist Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett led The Markup’s testing of Match Group apps. The Markup created more than 50 accounts across Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish to test how Match Group treats reports of sexual assault and whether users banned from Tinder after a reported sexual assault could return to Match Group apps by creating new accounts. We conducted experiments in April and May of 2024 and again in January and February of 2025. The results were similar across both rounds of testing.To start, The Markup tested if and how quickly Tinder would ban users who were reported for in-person behavior. We found that Tinder consistently banned reported users within two days of receiving a report.Next, we tested whether a banned Tinder user could use their exact same basic account information to sign up for other Match Group dating apps: Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Hinge and OkCupid prevented us from creating accounts, but Plenty of Fish allowed us to create new accounts. Within 48 hours, the Plenty of Fish accounts were taken down.Our next tests focused on identifying what type of changes would allow banned users to rejoin Tinder or create new accounts on other Match Group apps and use them like normal. To simulate what a typical user would try, The Markup utilized online guides and forums to identify commonly suggested techniques to get around a ban from a Match Group app. We then tried a combination of these suggestions, especially those that self-identified banned users claimed to have had success with. Across several rounds of testing, we found multiple ways to successfully create new Match Group accounts that bypassed the ban. Each method only involved simple changes in how we signed up and the information we provided during the process.When attempting to rejoin, or create a new account on another Match Group app, we used the normal sign up processes users go through and used the same phone as the original banned account. During multiple tests, we successfully created new accounts without needing to change the user’s name, birthday, or profile photos.The Markup did not test any methods that required significant technical knowledge and only utilized information that would be easily accessible to someone who did a cursory search of how to get around a ban. For example, The Markup did not test whether changing a profile photo’s metadata could alter the results. The Markup’s test accounts created for these experiments purposefully did not like, match with, or message any real Match Group users. — By Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett Your donations power our award-winning reporting and our tools.

Title: The Putin-Trump call was a true turning point

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory The only thing more dangerous than being America’s enemy is to be its friend. That is a statement often attributed to Henry Kissinger – the multiple, unrepentant as well as un-prosecuted war criminal, butcher of the Global South, and revelation-resistant icon of US foreign policy. And even if the sources are a little murky – involving the slightly deranged and badly overestimated arch-conservative grandstander William F. Buckley – it would have been just like bad old Henry: sort of witty, deeply malevolent, and yet realistic in its own, venomous way. Never mind that the idea is not that original: Aleksey Vandam, an unjustly forgotten geopolitical theorist and general of the late Russian empire, knew that much already. Watching the British and Americans abuse China, Vandam felt the Chinese had every reason for concluding that “it’s a bad thing to have an Anglo-Saxon for an enemy, but God forbid having him as a friend.” And yet some lessons are never learned. This time it is the turn of both Ukraine and America’s EU-NATO vassals to pay the price of trying to be friends with what, in a global perspective, has been – quite objectively, quantifiably – the most overbearing, violent, and disruptive empire of firstly, the post-World War II and, recently, the post-Cold War periods. Because that is one of the key messages of the increasingly intense – and now, finally, open – top level contacts between Moscow and Washington, that is, between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Let’s be clear: This is, in and of itself, a positive and badly overdue development. The recent, officially confirmed “lengthy and highly productive phone call” (Trump’s words) between the two leaders may not yet amount to a breakthrough. Even if Trump’s rhetoric – about a “successful conclusion, hopefully soon!” – already makes it look like one; Trump, it’s true, can be grandiloquent. Yet the conversation does already serve as a big, heavy slab of a tombstone on America’s absurd and very dangerous policy of decrepitly stubborn non-communication. Moreover, Moscow has now confirmed that a full summit is in the making. Even better, we also know already that neither Kiev nor the EU-NATO vassals were in the loop: There goes the daft, devious, and very deadly (for Ukrainians, too) mantra of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” And as a bonus: Soon there will be a lot about EU-NATO Europe without Europe. The fact that its leaders are, in the Financial Times’s words, “reel[ing]” and already clamoring for being heard merely confirms that they have been shunted aside. Rest assured: whatever cosmetic role the Europeans may be allowed to play (or not), they are delusional if they think they’ll matter. In reality, the Trumpists are brutally frank about what they have in mind for their underlings: Washington and Moscow make the decisions, the NATO-EU vassals fall in line and, also, pay for the outcome: Reconstructing Ukraine, Trump’s people feel, is for European budgets. And if – a big if, given Moscow’s objections – any Western troops somehow end up stationed in what will be left of Ukraine, then those too will be Europe’s very bad business to take care of as well. Let’s be frank: Both steps look harsh, but they are necessary. In the case of Ukraine, its leadership needs to be deprived of its implied veto power over peace. Because, first, that power is not real anyhow. It has always served as a smokescreen to allow warmongers in the West – recall Boris Johnson, anyone? – to sell their proxy war as the “will of Ukraine,” while Ukrainians have been used up as cannon fodder. Second, since the Ukraine War has long been a war involving – and putting at risk – all of Ukraine’s Western sponsors as well, it is obviously unjust that their populations’ security should not matter as long as a US puppet regime in Kiev doesn’t feel like peace. Third, Ukraine is not the same as that regime. Ever more of its people want a compromise end to this war, as polls have been showing for almost a year already. The regime’s superannuated, detached, and ever less popular leader Vladimir Zelensky and his team of slick operators and clumsy sycophants have no right to stand in their nation’s way. Regarding NATO, the EU and Europe: Apart from getting the acid disrespect they richly deserve for allowing the US and/or Ukraine to blow up their vital infrastructure, Europe’s spineless leaders have made it abundantly clear that the best thing they can do for world peace and international stability is to have no say. The antics of Kaja Kallas, the overpromoted simpleton who counts for the EU’s de facto foreign minister, are just the latest proof of that fact. And let’s not even start on Baerbock, Lammy, Macron, Starmer, von der Leyen… The list of war-besotted incompetents and “Atlanticist” sell-outs goes on and on. It’s not as if there had never been alternatives: remember what happened when Viktor Orbán, leader of bona fide EU and NATO member Hungary, tried to revive some diplomacy on behalf of Europe last summer? The Brussels gang went into an almost indecent panic attack, disavowing all such uncouth ideas: Diplomacy?!? Not on our watch! Well, what’s left to say now? You didn’t want talks with Orbán, now you’ll get freezing-out with Trump. Slow claps all around, once again. I am a European; I wished it were different. But reality remains reality: Unless NATO-EU Europe’s “elites” either grow up (very unlikely) or are replaced (if only), they should be left out of serious international politics. It’s better and safer for everyone, including their own countries. As things seem to be shaping up now, the US has signaled that it is ready to accept crucial Russian war aims: Ukraine will not get into NATO and Moscow will retain territories conquered during the war, as Trump’s secretary of defense Pete Hegseth has made clear. Both points, it is true, require serious elaboration: Moscow has been explicit for years that it will not agree to any settlement that leaves open the possibility of a “sneak”-NATO membership for Ukraine, where the West’s war alliance arms, trains, and equips but without formal membership, as it has already done. If anyone in Washington – or somewhere in Europe, for that matter – still thinks they can cheat, again, Russia will keep fighting. A Russian red line is a red line is a red line. And don’t forget: the West has zero credibility left. After three decades of massive post-Cold War bad faith and trickery over one issue after another, from NATO expansion, via the rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics and Libya’s destruction, to that of Syria – to name only a few examples – no one in Washington should assume they can have anything from Russia simply by saying “but we are different.” Art of the deal here, art of the deal there: This time, only hard-headed, verifiable quid-pro-quos will even be on the table. As ancient-history American uber-cold warrior and – weirdly enough, sort of co-peacemaker, in the end – Ronald Reagan once said in execrably pronounced but brave Russian: doveriai, no proveriai (доверяй, но проверяй): Trust but verify. Now it’s Americans who will get to hear that a lot and in proper Russian: if there will ever be a time again for trust, the West will have to earn it first. Concerning territory, only negotiations can clear up details. Yet, while there may or may not be some flexibility in Moscow, all Western and Ukrainian interlocutors should avoid getting up their hopes: This war has been costly for Russia, too; and whether its opponents and critics like it or not, it is winning. These two facts will translate into hard limits to Moscow’s flexibility on territory as well. Where exactly they are, remains to be seen. Trying to disregard them is a recipe for further or renewed war. This rapprochement in the still crucial US-Russian relationship is a very important development. That much is already certain. It was not unpredictable. Trump’s campaign statements, his overall sense of the world, and even his temperament made it more likely than not. But it could also not have happened: Washington hardliners, who are not extinct or powerless, might have nipped it in the bud. Indeed, they may still succeed. Nothing will be certain before an agreement is not only signed but also fully implemented in good faith (unlike Minsk-2 of sad 2015 fame, yet another agreement that the West – and Kiev – systematically betrayed). Yet let’s not overlook two important things that are already clear: As I have pointed out before, it is a fact now that Russia has defeated the West, in the simple sense that it is Moscow that is now imposing its terms on the war’s settlement; and the West’s leaders in Washington have now de facto acknowledged this outcome. While the West has fought Russia through Ukraine, its investment in treasure (including through self-damaging economic warfare), arms, intelligence, unofficial fighters, political support, and, last but not least, excessive rhetorical commitment is amply sufficient to make this a painful Western defeat, not “merely” a Ukrainian one. And that is how it will be perceived by the world, too. Trying to “take out” a resurgent Russia was always a predictably bad idea. Allow me, for once, to quote myself. As I wrote in December 2021, before the escalation of February 2022, a “major change in how the West and Russia relate to each other” was “inevitable” then already, because “sometime between, say, 2008 and 2014, the post-Cold War era has ended, and we are now in a post-post-Cold War world. It is this tectonic shift, Russia’s come-back, far from perfect yet substantial, that fundamentally drives the need for a geopolitical re-adjustment. The latter can happen in a deliberate and negotiated manner, or the movers and shakers of the West, first of all the US, can decide to let geopolitical nature take its course. The second course of, as it were, malign negligence would lead to a much bumpier ride to a new status quo, quite possibly with catastrophic effects.” It is that “much bumpier ride” that, hopefully is coming to an end now – at least for a while – and the result is in: The West has tried and failed to stop Russia; the West has gambled recklessly and lost. Russia is now stronger than before that Western failure, and the West is weaker. Because weakness and strength are always relative, as Thomas Hobbes, past master of realism and pessimism told us a long time ago. And here is the second thing that is already clear: The West is not one thing. While it is dominated by the US, its European vassals will suffer much worse from this historic setback. They could have stymied the American war course. If even one major European NATO state (France, Germany, Britain…) had come out and struck a deal with Moscow to never allow Ukraine into NATO, that state would have surely been punished by Washington, but the war could have been avoided. Because every individual NATO member has, in effect, veto power on new admissions. In an ideal scenario, the hapless vassals could even have banded together and rebelled against their risk-addicted lords in Washington. But they chose complete submission instead. Now they have only two options: Try to continue the proxy war on their own – if there will be a Kiev regime left to collaborate with – in which case the US will watch from the sidelines as they are being ground up. (No, NATO, that is, the US will not help… duh). Or they can give up and try to navigate their defeat by Moscow and abandonment by Washington as best they can through trying to mend ties with Russia. Their economies, in urgent need of rescue, would benefit, as stock market reactions to the recent developments signal. For their own sake, the European “elites” should finally return to reality.

Khosrowshahi started his career on Wall Street, before going to work for Barry Diller at IAC. Khosrowshahi took over as CEO of Expedia Group in 2004 and led its spin-off from IAC as a public company. 13 years later Uber, which was in the middle of a series of scandals and a board room coup, came calling, and Khosrowshahi took the opportunity to lead a service that customers loved, but which faced a lot of skepticism about its business model, and a long string of problems with regulators. Khosrowshahi helped right the ship, and led Uber in its 2019 initial public offering. Over the last few years Uber has proven out its business model, resolved its issues with regulators, while continuing to expand its Eats and delivery businesses. The question still remains, however, whether Uber could have been even more dominant with its founder at the helm? In this interview I ask Khosrowshahi about all of this, from his background to Expedia to the drama surrounding his appointment at Uber, including the lessons he learned and what he would do differently. We also spend an extended period of time discussing the next challenge facing the company: autonomous vehicles. Why did Uber give up on its self-driving car program, and why does it think it can compete with offerings from Waymo, Tesla, etc.? We dive into everything from supply and demand dynamics over time and space, to the OEM challenge for autonomous vehicles, to why Khosrowshahi thinks that Uber’s position as an Aggregator means the company is well-positioned for the future.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for clarity. Topics: Dara Khosrowshahi, welcome to Stratechery. Dara Khosrowshahi: Thank you for having me. This is our first time to talk and we have a lot to get to. I do always like to ask about your background, how you ended up where you are, but I might have to put a time limit on you. It started out with a very talented family that went through a lot of upheaval, and I think that might be the understatement of the Interview series. DK: (laughing) I’ll try to keep it short, yes. We were an immigrant family, we came here in 1978 after the Iranian revolution. My family ran a very big company in Iran, and we all thought all the children were expected to join the family company when the time was right. And then, we had the slight interruption of the revolution that caused us to flee Iran. We were lucky enough to have an uncle who lived in the US with his wife, and they took us into their homes and we got to rebuild our lives, so to speak, in the US. There was a waylay in France along the way, is that right? DK: Yes. We used to go to France for the summer, so at the time no one really knew the changes afoot in Iran. So we thought that we would just leave, go to France while things cooled down, calmed down so to speak. And they never did calm down. Right. Arguably still haven’t. DK: And yeah, I’m arguably still on vacation in France. So the vacation has continued, but we were lucky enough to come to the States and rebuild our lives. And then I had the average suburban childhood. I studied engineering in college, and quickly through that all the way to start a career in New York and finance, working at investment bank, Allen & Company, that you might know, which is a great place. And then, one thing led to another, and I met Barry Diller who was a client of mine, and I remember working for him on a couple of deals and I swore to myself, “If I ever have the chance to work for that guy, I will”, and he gave me the chance to work for him, and I went to become his deal person, so to speak. I moved up in my career with Barry for many, many years. He really has been the greatest business mentor and a great friend as well in my life, and I’ve got everything to thank him for. Was it a great fork in your career that you went to Expedia and not a dating app? DK: (laughing) That was a lucky call. At the time, one of the Expedia founding team, Erik Blachford, was running Expedia and he was a founder, he was a builder. He kind of wasn’t necessarily up for the management gig, so to speak. So he spoke to Barry and he said, “Listen, I’m going to do something more entrepreneurial”. I was the CFO of IAC at the time, and I guess Barry didn’t have anyone better, so he tapped me on the shoulder and I certainly volunteered. I loved travel, I’m very passionate about it, and I took over what was IAC Travel at the time, and as the travel business went through some trouble, IAC decided to spin off IAC Travel into its own entity, Expedia. That was when I become the public company CEO, and it was a trial by fire. I have to say that the early years were pretty rough, but after a while I got the rhythm of it. Barry was the chairman and controlling shareholder of that company, and we built that company in partnership for many, many years and it was a really, really good run for me. What surprised you most about your time at Expedia and the travel business? Was it always clear to you and Barry that this Internet dynamic, where the power is actually going to flow to an asset-lite discovery tool, you marshal all the demand and then supply comes onto your platform, a real inversion of the physical world. Was that clear, or were you discovering that along the way? DK: I think we saw some patterns forming, and I would say the most important model that we saw was actually Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster, if you remember the olden days, Ticketmaster obviously was amalgamating ticketing all over the world, and was selling through two channels, which were the Tower Records physical tickets, and then by phone you’d have to call 1-800-Ticketmaster and wait on the line for two hours to get your Madonna tickets. They opened up a website, and very, very quickly we saw traffic move over to the web. So for us then, at the time, fulfillment on the Internet was a real challenge. We kind of thought, “Well, what looks like Ticketmaster in that it has advanced reservations, booked either in person or through the phone, of a virtual good that didn’t need fulfillment”. Amazon hadn’t demonstrated the incredible capacity to use capital and use incredible skill to build the fulfillment network that I’m kind of a part of now. And so, the model, when you think about that, virtual goods, advanced reservation, no fulfillment needed, physical channel, phone channel, maybe moving onto the Internet, it looked like travel. It’s interesting you mention Amazon, because you had the similar idea to Jeff Bezos, who wasn’t looking to do books specifically he was looking at, “What is the right industry for this new Internet-enabled model?”, but he wanted to do the fulfillment part. But it’s interesting, it’s a similar story where you had a thesis and you were looking for an industry that fit the thesis. DK: Listen, same thing with dating, right? In the olden days on dating, you would call up and you would put your profile on the phone and other people would listen. So again, we were looking for these virtual-type goods and the opportunity to amalgamate a bunch of content in a much, much better way as it related to the Internet, and we found some of the early players, the Expedias of the world, the Hotels.com of the world, the Hotwires of the world. Back then, Barry is a terrific deal person, and I was leading deals for him, so our way of expanding into the category was through acquisition, and we got to see it early. And really, people talk about history not repeating itself as rhyming, Expedia was a rhyme of Ticketmaster, of Match.com, and we just used that patterning to make some early calls in what turned out to be a terrific opportunity for us. By that time, was supply already coming onto the platform organically? Or was there a lot of work to be done in actually signing up hotels and whatnot? DK: Oh, it was a huge amount of work to be done. And the business — actually the Expedia business developed mostly on the air side, so air tickets. Yeah. Easy to deal with, so it was actually easier to sign them up. DK: Exactly. It’s interesting. You start with them, but that meant your margins were worse because you weren’t dealing with that many entities. DK: Totally, and you had industrial switches like Amadeus and Sabre to plug into. Yep. DK: Older APIs, but you could plug into all of the content in the world very, very quickly versus hotels that other than the change, the hotels had to be a ground game, building out sales forces, going out and signing up these hotels, many of which were smaller businesses that had to be introduced to the Internet, they often didn’t have a website, etc. It turned out that while the early penetration of the business and the reason why or the biggest driver around online penetration was air, the business ultimately formed around hotels, because that was fragmented content that you can earn a lot of margin off of versus air that’s pretty consolidated, that relatively is a great eyeball attractor, but not great in terms of transactional economics. Now you just helped me summarize arguably the last decade of Stratechery, so it’s actually a great example. Were hotels on Expedia when you acquired them or was that part of what you worked on? DK: They were just starting to come on, and we acquired both Expedia and Hotels.com, so we had a player that was really strong in air, we had a player that was really strong in hotels, and independent hotels in particular — put it all together to form the new Expedia, which we took public. But the hotel business is the heartbeat of that business and is the vast majority of the revenue of that business. So you have a decade run there. DK: Yeah. You have this massive stock package that’s meant to keep you there for even longer, and then you left for Uber. What happened? What was the story? How did this develop? It was obviously — we all know what was happening on the Uber side, what was happening on the Dara side? DK: It was very unexpected. A headhunter just reached out to me, random call, and at the time, just like you, just like anyone, I was reading about all of the issues happening in Uber in the news. It was almost daily, the various challenges that were coming up there. So when I first got the call, I said, “Heck no, I’m not crazy, I’m not up for this”. But I actually talked to a friend, Daniel Ek from Spotify. And you realize that was eight years ago, by the way. DK: I know. It’s been a long time. DK: It feels like a long time ago. But I had one particular conversation that really shifted me, which was with Daniel Ek, who’s a good friend, and I still remember I was talking to him about my career at Expedia, how happy I was. And he looks at me, he’s like, “Since when is life about happiness? It’s about impact, you can have an impact on Uber, which is a really important company in the world that’s shaping the future of the cities”. And I think to myself, “Oh, my God, this is so obvious, I’ve got to take a shot”. I knew it was going to be uncomfortable. In hindsight, I didn’t quite know how uncomfortable it was going to be. Otherwise, I might not have jumped in. One big story about that is, as I understand it, there was this tense boardroom fight to even select you. DK: Yes. Travis Kalanick supported you, even though you’re like, “You’re not going to be a part of the company”. Was he just trying to get back at Benchmark, or did you just sit down and talk to him and sell him on your vision? DK: I still to this day don’t know exactly what went down at the board. I believe that there were two other candidates. I think it was Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Immelt, at least based on the news, and I think I was the third candidate that was the least objectionable to both sides. Right. DK: And since one side couldn’t win over the other, they kind of went with me, go figure as far as decision-making. But it certainly worked out for me, and I think hopefully it’ll work out for the company as well. You mentioned you took over Expedia from a founder. DK: Yes. And you were a Wall Street guy and then you were a CEO guy. DK: Yeah. And then, now you’re sort of the manager. Would you consider at that moment, did you feel that Uber was ready for that sort of manager? Could you have built Uber? Is there an aspect of maybe there’s some things Uber would’ve done very differently if Travis stayed? People still talk about this in the Valley, do you just tune that all out, or is it something that you think about late at night? DK: Listen, there’s certainly lots of them, could-have-been, would-have-been scenarios. My experience at Expedia taught me how to be an operator. I went through a period where I was a CEO of the holding company, but also running Expedia.com, and that taught me operations, and my background on Wall Street, that taught me a lot about capital allocation, etc. So I think that training really prepared me to come onto Uber and be the on-the-ground technical operator that the company needed, but also understand governance, understand capital allocation, etc. I have a huge amount of respect for Travis and the founding team, because it wasn’t just him who built the company, and they had to take a very aggressive stance as it related to regulations, the taxi unions, etc., and they had to bust through an enormous amount of resistance. I do think that at some point the company got so big and powerful, but was still undertaking, call it upstart tactics, and they weren’t able to make that adjustment, which is, “Hey, we’re no longer an upstart, we now have millions of drivers, it comes with responsibility, we have to have different kinds of discussions with regulators, etc.” — and I think I brought that maturity, in hindsight. You got some really powerful tools to negotiate with cities and governments, which is you have millions of riders and drivers, people depend on you, Travis built those tools. Maybe he wasn’t quite wielding them correctly, so if you have to zoom out, the transition in that regard does make sense. DK: Listen, the handover at the time, it was a difficult time, it wasn’t pleasant. But I got to take over a company that was in some ways in crisis, but a business model and a brand and a very talented team that was just terrific. So while the handover wasn’t pleasant, I’m very thankful for having the opportunity, and I think it will all worked out. So when you came to Uber, I immediately drew a connection between Expedia and Uber, and in this aspect of aggregating demand. And yet, when you talk about Uber now, you were just talking about it in the latest investor meeting, you talk about how Uber is supply-led, and that makes sense when you recall all the fights for drivers with your competitors. Was that a mental shift when you got on the ground, you’re like, “Actually, this is a two-sided network, but maybe the network works a little differently than I expected”? DK: It was definitely a learning. Expedia is an Aggregator, and you need to obviously match supply and demand, but the nature of the supply to Expedia is much more static. When you compare that to Uber, the supply-demand dynamics are so much more dynamic. The ability then, or the necessity to balance supply and demand in a real-time geospatial manner, is just a much bigger challenge. Uber, to some extent, it’s unique as a retailer, which is when we sell something we actually don’t even know — when we sell and price a ride, not knowing what our inventory is — we have to guess the inventory, predict what the inventory is. Every time we do a scan of the marketplace, it’s just a much more complex beast. I did see with Uber it being all about supply, which is as we aggregated supply, ETAs came down, surge came down, the service got better. To some extent, while it’s a simplification, the service sold itself. I do think in hindsight, if I think back to the Expedia days, one of the things that Booking.com, who was a competitor, who is a competitor with Expedia, got more right is that they were very supply-led. Yup. They were on the ground going to all those little hotels. DK: Exactly. Famously, Europe is much more fragmented than the US. DK: Totally. If I could do it all over again, a lesson with Uber is actually the power of aggregating supply. Certainly you need demand, but there are certain aggregation categories where supply brings demand, it brings more eyeballs. That, for example, is definitely true for us as it relates to our rides business, but even more so in the delivery business. Every single restaurant that we add is a new item to sell, but also the more restaurants we have in a particular search, the greater your conversion is. It not only brings in eyeballs, but it also brings in conversion. Those two obviously are multiplicative, which gets to be a much bigger business as well. We’re very supply-led as a company. I think as a manager of a big company, once in a while you get to learn, and I’ve definitely learned my lesson here. Yeah. This is one where I feel like this should have — it’s so clear to me now as you’re saying it. There’s always a bit about Uber that I couldn’t quite place it in the aggregator framework. I think this is exactly it, it’s this aspect of this is actually a supply-driven market, to your point. We’ve seen with Uber being supply-driven, such that the more supply of Uber leads to more demand, as you just said. Do you see a limit to that curve? If all Ubers were free, what would the world look like? DK: Well, you might get rid of personal car ownership, right? There is that. The question is what does that adoption curve look like? Listen, there certainly is a limit to the amount of supply that you can add to a network. We go through seasonal periods where demand is 35% of the peak demand. Let’s say in most markets, March, early in the year is peak demand, and then over the summer you kind of have the summer doldrums, demand goes down, and we actually have to slough off supply, this is a very simplistic picture. The key for us is to add supply over a long period of time, and then be able to push up supply or pull down supply, depending on the particular marketplace balance seasonally, and then based on time of day as well. That’s where the fun of algorithms of the matching and the pricing algorithms come in for us. How has the balance shifted over time? Are you still tweaking it between the price of the ride versus incentives for the driver and how many drives they do, and the non-ride? I don’t want to call it — not marginal, because it’s still marginal in terms of drivers — but it’s not marginal on a per-ride basis. DK: While the supply/demand dynamics are quite variable on a daily basis, you have these big cyclical characteristics that you see in the marketplace. Got it, so you can start putting in incentives, so drivers are coming on, because you know that demand is going to be increasing or whatever. DK: Generally we have an incentive pool that we are moving between — either the incentive pool goes to create demand or supply, based on the marketplace balance. There may be during rush hour the incentives go to build supply. During noon, let’s say, incentives may go to push demand. That’s kind of on a daily basis, but if you think about the big economic cycles, when I took over at Uber, we were oversupplied. Actually, adding supply was not difficult, we were looking to add more demand in terms of newer products, etc. Then, we went to COVID. Post-COVID, actually we were supply constrained. Biggest challenge was to get drivers to feel safe driving someone in the back seat with all of the fear and COVID, etc. With the government stimulus, a lot of people didn’t need to work right after COVID started settling down. Right. DK: That was a period of I’d say two or three years where we were hugely supply constrained, all of the incentive pool went to drivers. If you look today, the marketplace is much more balanced, and it looks like it’s moving towards being a bit more oversupplied, if you want to call that. The incentive pool on a macro basis is moving more towards building out demand and reducing prices for riders, etc., but these are long cycles and we kind of have this pool that’s typically constant. It’s not about managing a P&L, it’s about managing marketplace balance, both short and long term. We talk about the curve going down and people get rid of personal transportation, but when you talk about these incentives and going back and forth, that’s a commitment. It’s like, “I’m going to get rid of a car and take an Uber”, suddenly if the prices don’t feel reliable, because you keep on tweaking with the algorithm, how do you balance the daily versus the seasonal versus the, “We want to change how the way that people actually live”? DK: Oh, you have asked a deeply philosophical and difficult-to-answer question. Generally, one is we want to lower prices over a long period of time because that increases our TAM, the total available market size for us, I think thematically that’s absolutely true. Our flexing prices up and down in a particular market during a particular time is designed to maximize the reliability of your ride. Right. Reliability is more important than price. DK: Correct. ETA in four minutes, getting that ride when you want that ride. On a short-term basis, if you look over let’s say a 16-week experimental period, we can prove that out every single time. I think that the debate that we sometimes have is does surge and the unreliability of price over a longer term basis create a situation where people are less willing to give up their personal car? I think that’s to be debated. Every single time that we look at it, reliability of availability of inventory comes out on top. People understand the idea of surge pricing, they get it. It was an ingenious move by Travis and team to introduce that. I think it’s something that while we try to minimize is actually feature of the marketplace, not a bug. Yeah, and it’s sort of a customer education that happened over the long run. DK: Totally. You had the misfortune of having to manage Uber through COVID, but was there a bit where you have had the fortune of managing Uber in a world of high interest rates, relatively speaking, and this assumption of, “Oh, anyone could spin up a competitor” — actually, no you can’t. You have competitors with say, DoorDash and delivery, we can get to that, but there’s not going to be a new entry in the market. DK: The free capital period of the market was a really challenging time actually. For me as a manager, I managed a public company, return on invested capital was something that was incredibly important. That was my world, the discipline of profitability, etc., and I think it was one of the reasons why the board brought me in. To some extent, while the COVID experience and high interest rates made for a much more unfriendly environment for operators, they separated the wheat from the chaff. Yeah. It sucks to go through, but it sucks way worse for the weaker competitors. DK: Yeah, totally. At the same time, I would also tell you that overcapitalization reduces execution discipline. We will have engineers build out a feature, it’ll take three months, and it might optimize the marketplace by like 0.6% or 0.7%. That’s a huge win for us. Hugely celebrated, incredibly sophisticated algos to achieve those kinds of wins. Then, in the olden days, someone would just raise $200 million and just blow you out of the water. It didn’t matter all of the art and the craft of building the marketplace. Yes, it did matter, but it got lost in the macro of money sloshing around in the marketplace. I think the market that we’re in right now, appropriate returns on capital, etc., the consolidation of the marketplace, a bunch of competitors who are competing very, very aggressively profitable— Well, this is the whole thing, I was so mad about the whole 2017 era, because I had planted my flag early that there are meaningful network effects here, Uber is going to win. DK: Yes. Then, the problem with 2017 wasn’t just the management upheaval, but also your primary competitor in the US got a huge infusion of capital, because people were like, “Well, maybe Uber’s going to go under, we want in”. It’s like it delayed the inevitable. I’ve been gratified to see things mostly working out as I thought they would in the long run, it just took five years longer than it should have. DK: Value creation was in money raising, not spending it wisely. Now it’s the other way around, which I think is the way the world should be. Yeah. Well, I think in a lot of this conversation we’ve actually laid down a lot of the parameters for — and I’m going to have to try to play devil’s advocate here because I am I think more on your side in the way the market’s going to shake out with autonomous cars when and if they come along. DK: Sure. You’re doing partnerships with different autonomous driving companies in different cities. Why don’t you give me your high-level pitch on how you see this market? Then there’s a bunch of specifics I do want drill down into. DK: Yeah, definitely. Listen, I don’t think it’s an “if”, it is a “when”, and AV is a huge opportunity for the entire marketplace. It is. These robot drivers are going to be safer. I think that they have the opportunity at scale, and scale, it’ll take a while to get to scale, to reduce the price per ride and increase the TAM of this marketplace, trillion plus dollars. We think it’s an enormous, enormous long-term opportunity. Now, a couple of things have to happen before that opportunity actually turns into commercial business. When I say commercial, I mean something that can pay back for itself versus spend a bunch of money. That was 2017 era, right? Is it the 2025 era in San Francisco? DK: Well, it could be. It could be, right? But I do think that the market has changed, and I certainly hope it has. First you need a consistently superhuman safety record. It’s not good enough for a robot driver to be better than a human driver, it’s got to be multiple times better than the human driver. I think the capacity for society to accept human failure is much more than machine failure. Yeah. You went through this early on. DK: Absolutely. Did the fatality in Phoenix, did that change your mind as far as getting out of the autonomous vehicle market, or were you sort of already on that way and that sealed the deal? DK: I think we were leaning that way. It was certainly a very, very important factor in our determination, but I think a couple of issues were more paramount. One is we’re in the middle of COVID, so all of a sudden capital was much more dear. We went from losing $2 billion a year to losing $4 billion a year, which is pretty scary. My job is to make sure the company survives, and this was a significant money burning part of the operation. The other issue that was a big one was that even though we were developing ATG [Advanced Technologies Group] to some extent separately, we treated them as arms length, we have the marketplace separate from ATG, the other players with whom we wanted to partner, like Waymo, didn’t believe us. They didn’t want to partner up with a platform that was also a competitor. It was a little bit of a fork in the road, which is either we had to go vertical or we had to have the platform play, we couldn’t have our cake and eat it too. Then the last I would tell you is Uber is hard as an algorithmic software, software and operations company. Beautifully asset-light. DK: Yeah. Hardware was not our superpower. At some point, companies have to know their superpower. There are very few companies in the world who are great at hardware and software. Tesla, Apple are probably two of the leads, it’s very difficult to pull off. The accident, capital, how the business was shaping, you either had to make a bet on vertical or platform. We wanted to make a bet on platform, and then just superpower, were the four reasons why we decided to get out of it. It reminds me of the Netflix story of they basically built Roku and then spun it out. It’s interesting, because you have a lot of the similar dynamics. They didn’t want to have to compete with — they wanted to be on cable boxes and on all the other sort of devices out there. In the long run, setting them up, I think, potentially to gather up their foes who try to go vertical in the long run, but that’s the wrong company. We’re on Uber, I interrupted your story. You said, number one, superhuman safety record. DK: A superhuman safety record. Second, obviously you’ve got to work with regulators on the ground and you’ve got national regulations, state regulations, city regulations to kind of clear a pathway and I think safety is a big one. How does that differ around the world, or is this where US federalism is going to be a big advantage, or are there actually countries that are going to be ahead? DK: I think that the US generally is one of the leads. We’re seeing the Middle East open up, but it’s going to be very inconsistent as far as how regulations and countries and cities open up. Obviously we are in discussions with all of them so that we can be a part of that launch going forward, but it is going to take a while. And listen, these are really important discussions that we have to have with regulators, especially on the safety side as to what’s good enough. So that is moving, but it’s moving slowly. Third is you need to have a cost-effective scaled hardware platform, and right now there aren’t that many, there aren’t those platforms that have the redundancy, that have the compute, that have, for AV, that have the sensor kits, etc., for AV. It’s going to come in three to four years, but right now, over the next two to three years, that hardware platform, you could say with the exception of Tesla, it doesn’t exist. Then fourth, you need great on-the-ground operations. This is an on-the-ground game, city-by-city depots, cleaning, charging, everything that you need to do on a day-to-day basis. And then fifth, you need a high utilization network that can manage variable demand in a flexible way. We think the best way to do that, and certainly in the early days, is a hybrid of this base layer of autonomous supply, so to speak. That is then, on top of that, you’ve got humans who come in and out during peaks. The great thing about humans is, while they will eventually be more expensive on a cost-per-mile basis than let’s say a machine, you only pay for their utilization when they’re actually working, whereas with an AV, you pay, it’s kind of fixed, so just like you see in energy right now, well, you need a base layer of gas and then the electric grid then can handle the flex up and down with some of the newer energy sources, the same thing is going to be true. You’re going to need a base layer that’ll be AV, and then you’re going to need variability to meet high demand periods, and that will be ultimately we think a hybrid network of AVs and humans. Yeah, obviously you’re the ones that have the variable supply. Speaking of the network possibilities before, I’m on board with that, I should be a better devil’s advocate here. But let’s grant you this, you are the Aggregator sitting on top of the stack. I’m very curious to think through what do those layers, some of which you just listed, look like. So let’s take the actual cars, is the software stack and the hardware made by the same company or the different company? How do you see that playing out? DK: Excepting Tesla, it’ll probably be different. So if I look at the stack, it actually kind of looks like the hotel business, I’ll expand that in a second. Or, let’s look at the hotels for a second. Right, you’ve got the brands and the owners. DK: Well, you have the demand layer, which can be Expedia, it can be Booking.com, it could be Marriott. Then you have the brands themselves, whether it’s Marriott or an independent, then you have an operator. The operators, these are teams, management teams, sometimes Marriott is an operator of a hotel, sometimes there’s actually these local management companies as well, that’s an operator. Then there’s the asset owner, these are REITs [real estate investment trust]. Marriott doesn’t own almost any hotels whatsoever, these financial partners own the hotels, and then you obviously have the financier. We think that same thing is going to happen in AV. You have the network layer that’s Uber, that’s Lyft, it could be Bolt, it could be Waymo too, they have the wherewithal of also going direct. Then you have the driver. To me, that’s kind of like the brand, which is the Marriott driver or the Waymo driver. Then you have the operator, the management company. This is us or could be Moove.io, which is a partner of ours. Actually 15% of our inventory today come from fleet operators that are on the ground in these cities, so we think we can move them over to managing AVs very, very easily. Then you’re going to have the vehicle owners, and then you’re going to have financiers as well. Ultimately we think OEM manufacturers, most OEM manufacturers are going to have different software providers providing AV sometimes on an exclusive basis, sometimes on an non-exclusive basis. A GM, Tesla are going to develop it in house, but then many other players are going to license it, whether from a Waymo or from a Wayve or other companies as well, so you’re going to see a bunch of models. As the business financializes, as these layers come up, the player who can drive the greatest utilization of these really expensive assets called cars are going to be very, very valuable, and that’s certainly the part that we play in addition to the local operations level. Do we have an OEM problem? I think one of the things that you see with China’s developing auto market is basically it’s starting to look like the computer market, where you just have these basic platforms that can be then customized and accessorized, and then software defined on top of them can be churned out. They’re much simpler. You can have very small ones, you can have very large ones, but it’s all like a recipe in a box. In the West we have all these OEMs whose expertise is around the engine and is building these integrated platforms that don’t scale down to a $10,000 car or $5,000 car or $15,000 or whatever the price needs to get to. Are we stuck, especially if we’re putting 100% tariffs on Chinese cars? DK: Well, I think that the innovation going on in China or in the OEM space is extraordinary. You go visit their factories and the people who work in these car factories, they used to work at Foxconn. You’re absolutely right. They manufacture phones, now they’re manufacturing- Foxconn itself is making cars. DK: It’s absolutely extraordinary. And they, I think, have absolutely taken a leap ahead of any of the Western manufacturers. Will the US have access to that content, if you want to call it that? That’s a question mark, but there’s no question that the Chinese outside of the US have a huge advantage. There are obviously companies like Tesla who have taken similar approaches, I do think that the US OEMs have to make that shift. One of the surprises for me as I’ve watched the AV space over the past couple of years is, five years ago, if you asked me as to the most important success factor in scaling OEMs, commercializing AV, it was actually the software, the software was the biggest challenge. The heuristics, the data, the modeling, the simulation, etc. It looks like there are many, many players who are going to make it to the finish line on the software. Now actually building scalable OEM platforms with the compute, with the sensor kit, with the redundancy that you need in the hundreds of thousands, that’s going to be the next challenge, and the Chinese players are certainly ahead of the pack there, although there are many players in Asia, in Korea and Japan who we think are more than up for it as well. Well, but that’s the problem, hundreds of thousands is a very big number for this space, but in the context of the global auto market, it’s not very big. Is there actually a bit where if the US gains this capability, it might actually end up being a new player? DK: I think that there is a chicken-and-egg question, and I think ultimately the market for this software is going to be in personally owned vehicles and rideshare. I think you’re right, which is if rideshare is the only market out there, it’s going to be subscale, but I think 10 years from now, every single new car sold is going to come with some kind of FSD software. Right, but what do you want from a rideshare car, I can imagine being very different from what you want from a personal vehicle, or do you think there won’t be that much difference? DK: Totally. Well, I think those are tunable. So for a personal owned vehicle, you may not have LIDAR, or other LIDAR is very, very cheap. For a rideshare vehicle that’s going to have a lot of miles where safety is incredibly important, a $300, $400 solid state LIDAR kit is absolutely necessary. The newer generation of AV software is looking like it’s much more generalizable to different hardware configs and different sensor configs as well. So I think ultimately you’re going to have platforms that the Hyundai’s of the world or the BYD’s of the world build, and there’ll be tweaks for personal ownership and there’ll be tweaks for fleet ownership, so to speak. I don’t think that’s going to be an issue, but getting to scale is going to take some time. Is there any concern where the US might be pretty forward from a regulatory perspective, but because we don’t have access to these OEM platforms, it actually ends up being the rest of the world that gets to this autonomous state first just because they have access to the hardware and we don’t? DK: I do think that the rest of the world has an advantage in hardware chiefly because of China and the US has to develop it, and today the US is behind. So you did mention the fleet aspect. Right now you have this deal with Waymo, take Atlanta for example, you are going to be responsible for fleet management. Are those going to be gig workers, are you going to hire them, or is this just a temporary thing, you envision outsourcing this in the long run? How are you thinking about that layer? Right now you sort of outsource that to the drivers for free, it’s a great model, but now you have to actually pay someone to do it. DK: As I said previously, we work with a bunch of fleet managers all around the world, and one of our leading fleet managers is actually going to be operating with us in Waymo, in Austin and Atlanta, so we will bring that demand layer. We’re going to really drive very, very high utilization of these Waymos. Waymo brings a software layer and obviously the brand that people really, really love, and then our fleet partner Moove is going to be operating these fleets locally as well, so it’s a team effort and we’re excited. I mean, we think this launch is going to be absolute dynamite. Is there a bit where almost your biggest risk factor is interest rates in the long run? Because in the short term, if it’s a Tesla or it’s a Waymo, they have to build out these fleets to even gain baseline capacity, much less even attempt to reach into higher demand areas. It’s all fixed costs, it needs high utilization, which drives them into your arms because you have the most customers, you have the cheapest customer acquisition, all these advantages that you’ve talked about. But, if suddenly they can develop the wherewithal to stomach losses for, I don’t know, I mean the Waymo share in San Francisco seems pretty solid right now where they’re not necessarily being fiscally disciplined, is that a real risk factor for you? DK: Listen, if you don’t care about economics, then business model logic, that doesn’t matter, but at some point you need economics to work in order to scale, and in a world where certainly if the cost of capital is high and these cars are relatively expensive, the player that’s able to drive the highest utilization of these vehicles is going to have the lowest cost of capital. The player who works with us is going to be able to expand into every single market very, very quickly, will be first to market and being first to market matters, and I think those two elements, which is lowest cost of capital, ability to scale fastest, are going to play to the advantage that we bring in terms of being the best partner for AV in the world. So we’re pretty confident of our position. But I do think this is still, there’s a lot of experimentation that’s going on in this marketplace. Any new market that’s developing at very, very low unit volumes with AV right now, I think people tend to kind of take those models- Over-extrapolate on them. DK: Yeah, over-extrapolate. Yeah, because who cares if you lose 20 bucks a ride on a small number of rides. But if you’re doing 33 million rides a day, well, losing 20 bucks a ride is a problem there. You’ve got to start making money. I have two questions on that. On these potential vertical competitors, I think the experience of Waymo is delightful. DK: Oh, it’s great. I took my first Waymo and then I had to go back to the Grand Hyatt at SFO, which the Waymo did not go to at that point, I’m not sure if it does yet, but instead of taking an Uber, I took Waymo to the edge of Waymo’s territory, and then I switched to an Uber. I think that the question is, of course maybe that wears off over time, you get used to it, but it’s nice to be by yourself. Is there a challenge where people already have the Uber app, that’s a big advantage for you, they can go to one app and they can always get a ride, and hopefully it’s autonomous, but if autonomous isn’t available, you have the human drivers to scale and it’s so much more convenient, or are you concerned that the user experience will make users multi-home in a way that they’ll check Waymo first and then go to Uber? DK: I think it remains to be seen. Ultimately, what we’ve seen over and over again is that the ride is a bit of a commodity. You want to go from point A to B, the feature is where you’re going. Well the more it’s a commodity the better for you. I don’t live in San Francisco, so it was not a commodity for me, but I talked to people who were like, “Yeah, you forget about it very, very quickly”, so I’ll digress. DK: And it is a delightful experience. And it’s nice being alone, it’s nice listening to your own music and not having to ask for permission, so the experience is absolutely terrific. Over a period of time, we think that the feature is where you’re going and the player who can, again, get you where you’re going in the way that you want to, reliably, at the lowest price, at the lowest ETA, is going to play a big part in the development of this marketplace, and ultimately we think there are going to be multiple players. Waymo is absolutely in the lead, they are a great brand. They are setting the safety standard for everybody, but what we’re seeing is many players are solving this issue, and ultimately there’s going to be a choice of taking a Waymo, taking a Nuro, taking a WeRide, or taking a Baidu RoboTaxi as well. That choice is going to come in for consumers, and I do think the Aggregator model certainly would be helpful for all of those companies to succeed. It’s hard for me to push you too hard, because this is my theory as well. DK: (laughing) We need a third person to disagree with us, right? Well, is there a concern that Uber today is Expedia in hotels? Supply is highly fragmented. Yes, you have the occasional fleet operator, but they’re small enough, you don’t have to necessarily treat them any differently, but in an AV world, now you’re dealing with airlines. The margin compresses, because you’re not negotiating against that many people? DK: Yeah. I think if you look at it, there are two ways of looking at this, which is right now, general take rate for us on a global basis is about 20%. We take 20%, we pay the driver 80%. If you just look at it mathematically, that means that if we drive a utilization benefit of 25%, we’re paying for ourselves. The actual utilization benefit that we see in the markets in which we operate early on is much higher than that 25%, so any player should take that 80%, because the benefits of, instead of a ten-minute pickup to the next pickup, it’s a two-minute pickup, the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we’re sitting in a very, very good place, and my experience is, over a long period of time, markets move to the right economics of the model regardless of supply and demand, short term. They move there, so from a utilization standpoint, we are in great, great shape. Now, that presumes that there are going to be multiple providers who are able to play AV. This is the third time you’ve anticipated my next question, which is if can we get to this world, which usually there’s going to be one player at the nexus of a value chain, and they’re going to garner most of the profits, and everything around them gets commoditized and that’s the vision you laid out. It’s a vision that makes sense to me. Does this mean, though, that actually your potentially biggest problem might be Tesla? Because you mentioned before, they’re going to be an integrated player from the car to the software. You can imagine Elon’s like, “No, you’re going to use the Tesla app, I think I have the largest bullhorn in the world, I can drive customer acquisition on my own”, and that, even if it’s reckless, and you’ve said you’d love to partner with them, I’m sure you would, but that is ultimately the, if not a threat, at least the airlineification, maybe more than you would like. DK: Yeah listen, no one wants to compete against Tesla or Elon, if you can help it. Their capabilities are pretty extraordinary, but I think the same economic laws apply to them. Ultimately, if Tesla puts their cars on our network, we already have 150,000 drivers who are driving Teslas, and if they get FSD, they’d love to plug it into Uber as well. Then, that Tesla that is both on Uber, and by the way, they could be both on Uber and the network, that is going to create much, much more revenue. Ultimately, that’ll increase the value of the Tesla so that the residual value of that car improves, and if they don’t do that, there’ll be some other OEM that does it. So it all comes back to revenue generation, you have a box with wheels, you want to maximize the revenue of that box in order to reduce your cost of capital, and economic laws apply to Tesla, just as they do to any other car company. To some extent, you look at the food business. I’ll go there, right? McDonald’s has its own app, and has an incredible brand, has a lot of capital, has terrific reach. They still work with Uber Eats and DoorDash, because they want to drive utilization of the box called the restaurant, that same economic value is going to be true going forward. Ultimately, we’re hoping that my charm and the economic argument gets Tesla to work with us as well. If they want a direct channel, no problem. Hopefully the charm doesn’t matter! I’m going to come back to that, that’s actually my last question, but before I get there, you mentioned the food delivery business. Uber Eats. DoorDash is leading the market. What would you have done differently looking back? Do you chalk that up to, “The company was in upheaval, we were putting out fires left and right, we were selling off businesses everywhere”, is there a world in which Uber Eats is in the dominant position, as opposed to being in second place? DK: Well, we always want to be in first place, and while we’re in second place in the US, in many places around the world, we’re the number one player. We’re getting much stronger international business. Hey, I use Uber Eats, basically every day. DK: I know. I’m very familiar with this. DK: I’m just saying, and we’re gaining category position in ten out of our top markets. I think last quarter, actually, Uber Eats made more money in terms of EBITDA than DoorDash. By the way, I could say the whole, “Changing your lifestyle”, that is the case in Taiwan. DK: It is extraordinary. The combination, number one, scooters are so much better for delivery than cars. DK: Yes. Number two, just the density, and the way Taipei is laid out is actually very unique. There’s no centralized area, so there’s food everywhere, and all the way around you, but the way the response in the market, there’s just a huge swathe of restaurants that don’t exist anymore, but they’re only on Uber Eats. It’s not ghost kitchens, there are some ghost kitchens where they’ve created for Uber Eats, but it’s like all your old favorites, their storefront is gone, but they’re still on Uber Eats. It’s been pretty transformational. DK: If the world looked like Taiwan, Uber Eats would be two to three times larger in terms of the frequency, it’s pretty extraordinary. But coming back to the competition against DoorDash, I do think that one thing that they got right was really focusing on the suburbs. If you look in the US, in terms of the suburbs, it’s actually 60 plus percent of the marketplace. Uber has always been a really urban market, we grew up in cities, that’s where we already had the liquidity of the marketplace, and Uber Eats was kind of — they drive people, drive stuff as well. It was an offshoot, so I think DoorDash got the suburban family first, we got the urban 20-something year old first. We’re now kind of coming into each other’s markets. DoorDash’s market, the suburbs turned out to be larger than the urban markets, but for us, suburbs and less dense markets, actually, not only are there a huge opportunity in learning for Uber Eats, not just in the US, but all over the world. We’re going into secondary cities, tertiary cities, but it’s actually a really big opportunity with Uber. As we started expanding Eats into the suburbs, we’re seeing that there’s also Uber demand there. So actually, moving into these less dense cohorts and neighborhoods, big, big, is a huge opportunity for Uber Eats, but also Uber as well, which is I think we got another three to five years of penetration ahead of us. You looked in the last quarter, Eats actually accelerated its gross bookings level, so it’s going to be a dog fight with DoorDash, but they’re a strong competitor. We’re a really strong competitor, and I’m very, very confident that the network effect that we have, Rides, Eats, along with the Uber One Membership program that’s now 30 million strong, ultimately is going to come out on top of the full competitive field in food and grocery. Was there a little bit of a paradox you just identified there though, where you are talking about, and the first thing you mentioned on your last earnings call, was the cross-selling and people that are doing multiple transactions across both Rides and Eats, but at the same time, did that make it hard to prioritize and focus, whereas DoorDash had an advantage by doing just food, and was that a meaningful differentiator? Is that still a meaningful differentiator? DK: I think it’s very difficult for companies to do more than one thing or build more than one brand. Not only are we multi-service, but we also expanded internationally much faster than, let’s say, the DoorDash’s of the world and many other competitors of the world, and on a short-term basis, it’s much harder. You’ve got to build more services, you have to generalize for the international markets. It takes longer to build things, but over the long term, we think it’s a much stronger strategic position to be in. Again, DoorDash, they do only one thing, we think our superpower is in the platform. Their superpower, you could say, is in their focus. Every piece of evidence that we’re seeing is that the platform is winning against the whole ecosystem. Obviously, the markets that we’re chasing are much, much broader than just the DoorDashes out there. So final question, you’ve talked a lot about in the long run, you believe in the economics, and so I’m going to dismiss your charm a bit. It doesn’t matter, sorry, the economics are going to sort of rule the day and bring this market to you, it’s going to be an Aggregator market, it’s going to be commoditized, all the bits and pieces of a vertical player is going to have to be on your platform to utilize their assets properly. Very compelling. Is there a bit where, when you think back to your tenure, you go back to 2017, and you go through all the controversies, that actually at the end of the day, I’m sure you did a great management job, so I guess I’m dissing your charm twice in this question, that Uber pulled through because its externalities are actually just so great and it’s hard to get away from? I mean, this is a kissing your rear-end question, but I’ve always been such an Uber advocate, I think in part because I came from a relatively small town, I come from a state with a lot of drunk drivers. There’s these aspects of being able to get a ride, there’s three taxis in the city of Madison. They’re always at the airport, and they cost like $100. It’s been transformational, and that’s why you got regulars on board in the first place. People loved you and they would go to bat for you. Is that the key thing? I mean, I feel kind of embarrassed. I’m asking such a leading question that’s so great for you, but it feels like the structural argument you’re making is actually, this is the argument for Uber as a whole. DK: It is, and I got to take over a great company. If you remember at the time, there was WeWork, and there was Uber, and we were both burning a bunch of money. WeWork turned out to be a bad business model, Uber turned out to be a great business model. So, while yes, were there cultural challenges, were there governance challenges, were there brand challenges early on? Yes, yes, and yes, but the business model itself, the service was a service that people depended on. We’ve got eight million drivers who are choosing to be on our platform to make money whenever they want, where they want, etc. It’s a very, very powerful platform that I got to take over, and I think the power is only multiplied during these seven years, and hopefully I can keep it going for a few more years at least. Until the next company is in crisis. DK: (laughing) I’m staying at this one for a while. At least I hope I do. Famous last words! DK: It’s a lot of fun.

Title: The Tesla Revolt

The company’s fate will reveal how strong the foundation of Elon Musk’s influence really is. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 4:52 p.m. on February 12, 2025 Donald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company’s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call—not least that in 2024, Tesla’s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon. Instead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla’s path to being “worth more than the next top five companies combined.” This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars—a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins—was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.) Musk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because—despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans—he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk’s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there. Musk needs that belief to hold. Tesla’s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla’s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter. For all of Musk’s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its “money-losing start-up” phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla’s market share is China’s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did. Yet that competition can’t entirely account for Tesla’s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla’s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge. Musk’s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla’s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company’s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk’s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk’s Sieg heil–ish arm gesture at Trump’s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can’t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla—many from longtime Tesla owners who say they’re ready to move on. In theory, Musk’s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it’s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn’t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he’s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs. Nor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about “more affordable” new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company’s “unsupervised” robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he’s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking—which he’s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years—is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks. In the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” technology and its claims about the technology’s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations. Tesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California’s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk’s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America’s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up—especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla. Musk’s approach to Tesla’s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla’s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google’s Waymo. Musk’s Tesla faces the rising threat of China’s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD’s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they’re noticing where Musk’s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla’s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains. The most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who’s to say anyone will buy what they’re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can’t do that—or at least keep convincing investors that he’ll be able to—he’s just another guy screaming online.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Lyft shares slumped about 9 per cent on Wednesday after the ride-hailing company warned that lower pricing trends from late last year are expected to continue in 2025, as it tries to match prices with larger rival Uber. The ride-hailing platform has been aggressively working on luring customers and drivers onto its platform by keeping prices competitive and launching new features that differentiate it from Uber. However, Lyft said on Tuesday that it saw prices fall in the fourth quarter and the trend has continued so far this year. It added that the company had to drop fares for rides and give away more coupons in the last few weeks of 2024 to keep prices competitive. In contrast, Uber said last week that it expects prices for its affordable private car offering, UberX, to be marginally up this year, as it passes insurance cost hikes on to consumers. "What seems clear though is U.S. rideshare is allocating more incentive dollars towards consumers, funded by lower incentives to drivers — ok 'if' done with balance," Bernstein analysts said in a note. Lyft said it had the flexibility to adjust incentives to balance supply and demand in the marketplace since it had a robust number of drivers on the platform. "We suspect prices will be lower for longer which will test the elasticity of demand for the industry," Needham analysts said. At least thirteen brokerages cut their price targets on the Lyft stock, a day after the company's fourth-quarter results, bringing the median PT to $18, as per data compiled by LSEG. Lyft on Tuesday forecast gross bookings below Wall Street estimates, similar to rival Uber's projection last week. Lyft's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 13.4, compared to Uber's 29.4. In 2024, Lyft's shares fell 13.9 per cent, while so far this year it has risen 11.6 per cent. Its market capitalization was set to fall by more than $500 million to roughly $5.4 billion, if losses hold. Uber's shares were about 3 per cent lower on Wednesday.

Title: How Tariffs Make CFOs’ Jobs More Complex

Plus: Consumers Feel Economic Change Slowly, Planned Aluminum And Steel Tariffs Rile Allies, Vought Uses OMB To Halt CFPB, Tech Companies Invest In AI Infrastructure There’s been a huge amount of change in the last month, and from an economic standpoint, it seems to be hitting consumers slowly, but surely. Job growth is stuck, prices don’t seem to be going anywhere, and many feel they are financially worse off than a year ago. January’s jobs data from the Labor Department, released last week, significantly missed growth projections and signified the weakest start to a year in terms of new jobs since 2016. Economists were expecting 170,000 new jobs, but the report showed the addition of just 143,000. And the expectation of job losses is growing. In the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, released this week, 14.2% of people feel a probability of losing their jobs in the next 12 months, up 2.3% from December. About a third of consumers said their household financial situation is worse off than a year ago, the Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. And while this is down slightly month-over-month, only about 19% say they are doing better than a year ago—a 3% decrease from December. Over a fifth aren’t optimistic about the economy and say they will be doing worse a year from now. January’s Consumer Confidence Index, reported two weeks ago, showed a 5.4-point decline from December. The data shows some optimism. Labor Department data showed record-high average hourly wages of $35.87, as well as an unemployment rate of 4%, down from 4.1% in December. And 36.6% feel their household finances will be better a year from now, according to the Survey of Consumer Expectations. However, there’s lots of room for improvement. Two-thirds of Americans feel that President Donald Trump administration’s policy focus so far isn’t doing enough to lower prices, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll last week. The next round of consumer price index numbers come out this week, which will show just how much prices are changing—though the consumer expectations survey shows that Americans anticipate price increases for food, gas, rent and medical care. CFOs are increasingly having issues with making projections since so many companies rely on imports, and so many different tariff threats are being quickly proposed, rescinded and taking effect. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement of cash management software platform Kyriba, about how CFOs can plan in today’s circumstances. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Workers in Camden, N.J. use a crane to load a 60,000 pound coil of steel onto a railroad car. President Donald Trump signed another round of tariffs this week: 25% on all steel and aluminum imports. “This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” Trump said as he signed the tariff orders in the Oval Office, CBS News reported. This is a familiar policy to Trump, who assessed tariffs on steel and aluminum in his first term to bolster domestic industry. Those tariffs—25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports—had several exemptions, and ended up bringing the biggest benefit to steel companies, according to a 2018 analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Allies from the EU and Australia spoke out about the planned tariffs, which are reported to go into effect next month, saying that they will harm U.S. consumers and long-established partnerships. The U.S. imports about a quarter of all of the steel it uses, and about half of the aluminum, Reuters reports. Most of the steel the U.S. imports comes from Canada, Brazil and Mexico, while the lion’s share of aluminum imports come from Canada. Several analysts have said these new tariffs will have limited benefit to the U.S.—likely just for the steel companies—and will not likely create jobs. They are also likely to raise prices for most things made from metal. Even the United Steelworkers International Union feels the tariff proposal goes too far, and wrote the U.S. needs to take a more measured approach, distinguishing trusted trade partners. The move caused significant shifts in the stock market, boosting prices of domestic metals companies, including Alcoa and U.S. Steel. It also boosted gold prices to a record high of $2,938 per troy ounce, as investors search for stability. This isn’t the only move on tariffs in the last week. Trump announced during a Friday meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week—tariffs equal to what other countries impose on U.S. goods. There’s no word yet on how those might work. Russell Vought at a confirmation hearing in January in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Last Thursday, the Senate confirmed Russell Vought as the head of the Office of Management and Budget with a vote along party lines. Vought, founder of the prominent right-wing Center for Renewing America and key adviser to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial Project 2025, was considered one of Trump’s more controversial nominees because of his viewpoint of expansive executive branch control on spending. One of his first big moves is essentially halting all work of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, taking its website offline and telling workers not come in and stop work activities. The CFPB was created in 2011 following the Great Recession and financial crisis. It’s an agency that protects consumers from unfair banking practices, but it also has deep-pocketed enemies. Elon Musk, who has been working with his Department of Government Efficiency task force to mercilessly cut perceived wasteful spending, has railed against CFPB because “there are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” He said this in November, shortly after the agency announced more oversight of big tech companies and others offering digital funds transfers and payment wallet apps. Meta founder and CEO and billionaire Marc Andreessen also have spoken out against the agency, which has threatened action against tech companies’ use of financial data. Rendering of Meta's Sucre data center in Louisiana. AI evangelists say the technology can do a lot for companies, but to continue to grow—both revenues for companies and capabilities for users—some infrastructure investments are needed. Big companies are announcing bigger AI data center projects, with bigger budgets and footprints. Forbes’ Christopher Helman runs down many of these plans, which include not only huge facilities like Meta’s $10 billion planned Sucré data center in Louisiana—covering 4 million square feet of floor space on 2,250 acres—but enough infrastructure to power it all—$3.2 billion worth for Meta, coming from twin high-efficiency natural gas turbines. In all, Meta plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on these data centers in the next year. Meta’s not alone in these investments. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, announced on last week’s earnings call that the next year will see about $75 billion in capital expenditures for technical infrastructure. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that in the last quarter Google hit capacity issues with its cloud and services business, which constrained its growth. Microsoft is planning to invest $80 billion in data centers. And through a partnership announced from the White House between SoftBank, Oracle and OpenAI called “Stargate,” SoftBank will invest $500 billion in U.S. data centers during the next four years. Kyriba Global Head of Enablement Bob Stark and the Port of Los Angeles. Economic predictions were challenging for CFOs before Trump’s second presidency began, but announcements of potential tariffs on different countries and industries, and along a variety of timelines, add a lot more uncertainty to the future. I talked to Bob Stark, global head of enablement at cash management software platform Kyriba about what CFOs are going through and what they can do to prepare for the short- and long-term future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. Tariffs were also a feature of President Trump’s first term. How similar is what’s happening right now to then? Stark: You look at what was announced around steel and aluminum, and that feels very similar to what we saw in the previous term. That said, I think the differences—and our clients had the same reaction: the blanket tariffs, the punitive tariffs, if you tariff us, then we’ll tariff you back and it’s sort of back and forth—feel a little bit more significant than what we had experienced previously. It certainly feels like an acceleration. CFOs and finance teams are definitely looking at that as a lot of different potential scenarios that you have to prepare for. It’s not as simple as: This industry is affected [with a] 25% hit, so if you’re a Canadian steel exporter, you have this problem—which is fairly predictable. You can figure what 25% looks like. Same with importers on the U.S. side. [They’re] just trying to understand what does our cost look like? They can map out demand, but it’s the back and forth and the uncertainty around that. It’s difficult to predict exactly when impacts will be felt, which is a big challenge for CFOs. Many of them are looking to provide updates to guidance quarterly. In this quarter, do we have a cashflow impact that we need to control? Do we have a liquidity challenge where we need to make some plans? Do we need to provide different or maybe more expansive hedging of FX [foreign currency exchange] because we recognize that it’s these short and sharp movements that can have a significant impact in the balance sheet and income statement reporting at the end of the quarter. There’s a lot. It’s the uncertainty of what is the actual impact. There’s so many more scenarios you have to play out in different ways that feel different than what we saw several years back when we first saw this idea of tariffs being proposed and implemented. This time around, it feels to me like some of the tariffs that are being threatened and announced are more unexpected. Is that your impression? Absolutely. It feels to a corporate CFO that there’s a daily news cycle that you have to invest more time in following. You have to then build that into your analysis and reporting. If you’re doing something as simple as: What is the impact of cashflow if this blanket tariff goes in. What’s the difference? It’s being delayed by 30 days. What does that mean? There’s a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability around that. That’s the biggest challenge for CFOs. It’s like playing that hand game with your kids. You put one down, then there’s another, and then there’s another, and then there’s another. And then suddenly you think, ‘Wow, where did this go?’ That’s the part that’s really difficult to predict and build into an analysis. When the CEO is calling you because they just saw this on CNBC, and they’re asking the question: What’s the impact on our cash flow? Do we need to change our guidance? You have to juggle not just one or two different possibilities, but [there’s] probably three or four different scenarios you need to model against the same data, and then you have to be in a position to answer with precision on demand. And, ‘I’ll get back to you tomorrow’ is not an acceptable response. It’s ‘I’ll tell you right now, if these tariffs go through, this is what the impact is. If they’re delayed out 30 days, if they’re delayed out six months…’ Those are the scenarios that you have to be able to report to the board with confidence so that everyone's prepared. How do you think a company can make its way through the next four years? There’s three things that CFOs can do, aside from watching all the news and being able to utilize AI to summarize the things that they can’t watch live. Once they’re armed with that insight and understanding of sentiment, they’re in a position to do three things. Number one: FX. Those sharp, short-term movements can be the difference between hitting and missing guidance. Every CFO has to be able to quantify the impact of currency on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. If they’re not in a position to do that, then it erodes confidence a little bit. No one wants choppiness. They want certainty, and they want at least three months—ideally more—in advance. If you can eradicate the impact of FX, or mute it significantly, you’re in a better position than many of your peers. Number two: forecasting and planning. Every time there’s impactful news, CFOs need to answer: What would this mean to our cash and liquidity in the future? Finance leaders, they must have precise answers. They have to have them at the ready. They have to be available for multiple scenarios so that hypothetically speaking, they can answer a question like this: Our cash flow decreases by 30% if this tariff actually happens in the next 20 days. You need to be able to answer the question with that level of precision. That CEO and the board, they’re not waiting an hour. They’re probably not waiting five minutes either. They expect data and insights right now. The third part: Getting control over the cash lifecycle. CFOs need to be able to pull multiple levers to maintain control of their cash, especially in response to customers wanting to bring forward orders to get ahead of tariffs. That’s a perfect example of being able to have control, making sure that they can provide the structure, the systems financing to allow changes in the supply chain to occur. Also [to be able to provide control] in response to potential reshoring or recomposition of supply chains. Some of that is a little bit more longer term. That might be later in 2025 or into 2026. We recognize we just can’t compose our supply chain this way. We need to reshore this part of it. We need to eliminate this country out of our supply chain. It just doesn’t work in terms of the cost structure. Whatever that scenario looks like for them, the CFO needs to be able to put in the structure. It’s very tactical. Everything from bank accounts to cash management structures, the ability to sweep the and pool cash and mobilize it wherever it needs to be, to not only invest, but also repatriate cash so you can meet those cashflow objectives of the organization. There’s a lot of complexity there. Nevermind working with supply chains, working with customers to be able to pull the lever of: We’re going to pay you earlier, but it’s going to come at a cost, and as a result, we need to be able to do that. You want to get paid earlier, Mr. and Mrs. Supplier, we’ll do that, but here’s the program to do it. Same thing with accelerating receipt of cash. If you need to accelerate collections, you need a structure with that. It’s not a program that just happens like that. It’s a year in the making to put that structure in with your banks and with your finance and providers.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow. Constructive comments welcome, as always.

Not sure why they are so cheap but they are 50% off the already bargain price and it's also possible to schedule a delivery for any day this week. Bear in mind you might be taking a risk of it being out of stock if scheduling for Valentine's Day. Price is $11.04 + $1.99 Delivery Fee + $1.10 Service fee for a total of $14.13. Pink roses are even cheaper, $12.93 for 10 delivered. Tried in a couple of different states and seems to be available everywhere I've checked. $0 Delivery Fee on your First Order. Referrer receives something too (Likely free delivery on next order). Cannot be stacked with new user signup codes. Not in SA. These guys deliver free anywhere. $12.99 delivery fee for me lol Still a bargain if you compare what others are charging. $15.99 delivery for me Couldn't find Harris Farm Markets in Brisbane, QLD - there is one a suburb over, so a little surprised. Oh well. I tried Sydney (city) and Gold Coast (Southport) was the same price. Can't find Clayfield store. Automatically chooses Redfern. Same! Didn't have the pick up option for West End - so I put in Harris Farms as the delivery address with the instructions to meet me out the front of the store. Fingers crossed. I'm in Zillmere and it worked for me (assume it's the Clayfield store). Managed to get 50% a large bouquet ($35 down from $70) and added a block of chocolate to get it over $40 to save an additional $20. Spent less than $25 to get both! Oof, nice. I can't even find this item at the Clayfield store at all, is it still there? How? I'm in North Lakes and can't seem to order - delivery not availabe. Username checks out. Delivered on Valentine’s Day? You can schedule a delivery for then as you can with any Uber Eats delivery. (At your own risk ofc) Thanks OP!! Ordered now let's see if they show up in the next hour as the app says they will!! Don't forget to add an eggplant/cucumber/zucchini for an extra $0.59!!! Does she need something to make up for what you lack?! :) Yes Then just pay $0.59, forgo the flowers. Great deal. You can schedule delivery for Friday (Valentine’s Day). What a win! Scheduled but what are the odds of these being delivered on valentines day! My guess is 'slim' but you never know, Harris Farm have pretty good customer service in my experience. You would hope that they would hold back the stock for delivery for those orders already made. No clue what these roses will look like when or if the come on Friday but worth a gamble! Ps make sure you say refund if out of stock to avoid any replacements at higher prices. Thanks op Any clue where the option/setting is to do this in the UE app? I stumbled onto it at checking my scheduled orders. what these roses will look like Got them delivered a couple hours ago. They looked really nice. Was braced for a lot less. Plain wrap, no extra frills. ( But I only got 9, not 10 ☹️ ). Is it the same price in store? Could go for some mortadella Looks like it's $22 in store, where I checked anyway No love for Melburnians! And no —- either! 40 flowers for $28.60 Thanks OP Time to sell them on the side of a busy road. How did you get $20 off ? This targeted deal Girlfriend is either gonna be really disappointed or really impressed. Either way I can't lose You never loose to GF. You lose when she becomes wife So, always win by staying as her BF ? A win win if you can 😄 @Username Taken: You believe you win; she wins with the lawyers. yeah i thought i was winning when GF became wife but nope lol Do these come wrapped in paper at the stems or how are they sent out. Mine came as a bouquet in paper. Not showing as an available SKU for Harris Farms Chatswood/Willoughby. Might be expired/OOS. On checkout page is states: "promotions are estimates, not guaranteed, and may depend on item and promotion availability in store, you will be charged the in-store price for available items in your cart". Is that mean if schedule on Friday and no 50% off promotion on that day, you will get charge full price? Nothing says I love you more than having an unwashed man with pungent B.O arrive with flowers… This is why you should always use a delivery driver. Or have a shower. $15.99 delivery in Canberra $6.49 for me ($0 as UberOne) for delivery from Harris Majura. You could try pickup? $4 service fee. Free delivery for me since I spent $30. Getting it delivered from Majura Park $17 delivery for me (uber one) Make sure you're ordering from Majura Park Harris Farm lol Yes, indeed I tried a Weston Creek address and a city address and both saying too far. Wth If you're an UberOne member apparently there's no delivery fee. I'm not and the delivery fee is $15.99. Nice - 40 roses delivered for $26.18! (20x Red + 20x Pink, less $20 off $40 spend promo with free delivery for Uber One!). I give this ~10% chance of showing up, but if it does then that's a huge win! Thanks OP! Update: 20/40 roses delivered this morning! But it's a good news story, after an ~$11 refund, that's still 20 roses delivered on Valentines Day morning for $15. Call that a win! Fingers crossed DD does a repeat of last year's deal with the free flowers from Coles :P $15.49 delivery fee. Does Uber One cover the delivery fee for stores that are farther away? Legend Pink roses are even cheaper OP can't work out why he is single OP made it this year and shared ozb with 50% off 'bedroom ticket'. Ordered. Cancelled… I am single and just ordered a bunch of roses for myself Western Sydney was out of stock and double the price. CBD worked A-OK. Hope they are delivered! Thanks OP Woah nice price. Thanks Tried ordering from a few stores in Sydney and wouldn't let me check out, said I had to cancel my order. Ordered two bunches of 10 long stem red roses. Got two bunches of 5 long stem pink roses. Have raised a support case with Uber Eats. Harris Farm Boronia Park in Sydney. How did they come, curious if it comes in paper or how the bottom is wrapped. Thanks They came wrapped in plastic cellophane type stuff, bottoms exposed, placed in a paper Harris farm bag Getting jipped with colour and quantity. FrankGrimes has a right to vent ! Yes same happened with me - ordered red then pink arrived. Not sure if the uber eats rider picks them or they are picked and bagged by the store? Either way, they were refunded, just follow the links to report an issue with the order and take a picture I reported it last night but have heard nothing back from Uber Eats support. Useless Strange! Mine seemed to be refunded immediately (and automatically) with no fuss Anybody know of some good options like this but in Melbourne? $6.99 delivery fee for me (Canberra) :( Item replaced - Sydney. What was yours replaced with? Not a cat I hope :D Haha nothing with a tail. Use this to chase tail. Just a heads up, it comes with the pricing sticker attached. It's also wrapped in a black piece of plastic with the flower sticking out the top Thanks for the info, does it come with any name/payment details aswell? In my case just in a Harris Farm brown paper grocery bag within which was the 10 stem bouquet. Ordered the red bouquets, got white. Went through Uber Eats to complain, got a refund immediately- minus $1.99 delivery. $1.99 for the 10 long stems white roses, yes please. Winning Easy enough to dye them red! Winning! Do you have a picture? Was it the original price or the discounted price on the sticker? Original price $15.99 just for delivery in Sydney - crazy. Not if you’re 20km from the nearest Harris Farm.. I got $2.99 delivery fee in Sydney, however it was deducted (I don't have Uber One) and only $1 service fee charged. I was able to choose the date and the tile slot. 10 stem bunch of Blue Iris for $7.64 delivered. That's almost free. Free delivery. Booked to tomorrow arvo. 15 yrs married and no flowers, let's see if this yr is a winner. Too far from store :(, won’t even allow me to enter pickup Harris Farm? Uber Eats? where is the nutritional value on this? Roses out of stock in Qld but ordered a different bunch + choccies and chippies, total $30. Mrs will be stoked. Which store? West end Uber one but also paid more at checkout (NSW) Thought I’d get in early and order today. Flowers were unavailable (red roses) selected colored roses which was an upsell. Waited and order wasn’t cancelled anyway. Maybe plan ahead or have plan b ready. Ended up getting 2 bunches from QE foodstores for 50% off.. not a bad alt or choice if available to you. Worked out cheaper than Harris Farm with good options. Not available in regional area (Northern NSW) and the price has also changed to $24.80. The price of all of the flowers have gone up today compared to yesterday. I had some in my cart to order this morning and the discounted price had gone up over $4 per bunch. Was ordering multiple bunches of different flowers. All have gone up in price, some quite significantly. Can anyone comment on the quality of these ? Ordered two bunches for my girlfriend and wife.
