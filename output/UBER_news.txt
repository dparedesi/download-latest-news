Yves here. The individualized price gouging that Delta plans to implement seems to be coming soon. But as Hubert Horan explains, this case of “AI is coming to eat your lunch” does not look as easy to pull off as Delta might think. Even so, Congresscritters are already saddling up to head Delta off at the pass. The proposed bill below is in addition to objections raised by three Senators that Hubert mentions below. You shouldn’t be charged more or paid less because of your ZIP code or search history. I just introduced a bill to ban “surveillance pricing” — when corporations use your data to hike up prices or cut your wages. It’s invasive. It’s exploitative. And it needs to end. pic.twitter.com/4vOn6AFPF2 — Congressman Greg Casar (@RepCasar) July 27, 2025 The Economist just reported on another ruse that some US airlines tried implementing. It falls short of the individual pricing threat, but still got travelers’ dander up: In recent years airlines have grown ever more sophisticated in their pricing techniques. American carriers’ latest method of singling out business passengers, though, is strikingly simple—and has sparked outrage in the travel blogosphere. In May Thrifty Traveler, a website about travel bargains, reported that America’s three big legacy airlines—American, Delta and United—had started charging higher per-person fares for single-passenger bookings than for identical itineraries with two people. Kyle Potter, the author, grumbled that the practice amounted to carriers “weaponis[ing] their fares” against solo travellers who “can’t clone themselves”. Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, another travel site, called it “greed getting out of control” and said that airlines were “asking for government intervention”. Although no airline has yet commented on the subject, Delta and United reportedly scrapped the practice amid the criticism. To investigate further, The Economist turned to Serpapi, an automated interface to Google Flights, a fare database. For all direct domestic journeys on America’s three big legacy carriers, we downloaded one-way main-economy fares as of July 20th for one and two passengers to travel on Monday July 28th, choosing whichever flight had an airline’s cheapest single-passenger price for that route that day. We also pulled return fares—one the following Friday and the other on Saturday—for both one and two passengers. In total, we amassed 19,000 prices across 3,200 routes. Delta has indeed abandoned the technique: its two-passenger price is always at least twice the fare for one. But American and United have persisted. Solo flyers who travel with them within the work week can end up paying more than everyone else, including solo travellers whose journey involves a weekend stay and those who travel with others, regardless of whether their trip stretches into a weekend. In other words, airlines are exposed to consumer backlash, and even, as regulated entities, political pressure. So individualized pricing were to get traction, some airlines could tout their abstention. I could see Middle Eastern carriers, like Qatar Air and Emirates, which cater to a high end clientele, advertising that they don’t nickel and dime customers this way. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016 Delta’s President Glen Hauenstein told investors that it sees AI-driven personalized (or surveillance) pricing as “a full re-engineering of how we price, and how we will be pricing in the future”. He said “we’re really excited about partnering with Fetchrr” (Delta’s Israel-based AI consultant) whose tools were helping Delta “get inside the mind of our consumer” so that eventually, “we will have a price that’s available on that flight, on that time, to you, the individual.” He said that AI tools were now setting prices on 3% of Delta flights but he expected 20% of flights would be AI priced by the end of 2025.[1] The definition of personalized/surveillance pricing is well understood and represents a radical departure from other forms of algorithmic pricing. [2] Algorithmic pricing simply means that many of the rules (algorithms) governing when prices should be adjusted in response to new information about consumer demand or competitor actions have been automated. Airlines pioneered pricing automation in the 1980s, which incorporated second degree price discrimination, so different fares can be offered on flights with higher or lower demand, and different fares can be offered with different conditions (advance purchase requirements, different checked baggage or seat assignment surcharges). But under second degree price discrimination every consumer sees the exact same price offering at any given time. Every consumer has the identical opportunity to pay less if they buy in advance and can only sit in the very back of the plane or pay more at the last minute and sit closer to the front. Delta is reengineering its pricing around using first degree price discrimination. Personalized/surveillance data is used to estimate the maximum price each individual would be willing to pay. Individuals would no longer see the same prices that all others are seeing. Any claims that first degree price discrimination would improve overall efficiency or benefit consumers are false. The original use of second degree price discrimination in the 80s did improve efficiency and consumer welfare. Price sensitive customers who were willing to buy tickets on lower demand in advance got much lower fares than previously available, and more time-sensitive customers willing to pay more got greater access to higher demand flights at the last minute. Airlines achieved much higher capacity utilization (load factors), earned much more revenue on flights that had previously been half empty, and avoided the huge expense of adding aircraft that were only needed at peak periods. But the efficiency gains from price discrimination were exhausted long ago. Increased price discrimination would only be a wealth transfer from consumers to airline shareholders. To use simplistic Economics 101 terminology, when everyone sees a standard market price, a consumer surplus is created because some consumers would have been willing to pay more. First degree price discrimination using personalized/surveillance pricing attempts to eliminate as much of that consumer surplus as possible by charging each customer the most they would be willing to pay. Passengers pay more without getting anything of value in return. Lots of companies have tried to introduce personalized/surveillance pricing but corporate announcements including Delta’s usually generate consumer backlash. Three Democratic Senators complained that this could support predatory pricing and demanded that Delta disclose what information about individual consumers it would be using to set prices. [3] Airline passengers understand that airlines don’t have their best interests in mind, can quickly see through attempts to claim first degree price discrimination is the same thing as traditional second-degree discrimination and readily dismiss ludicrous attempts to claim personalized/surveillance pricing will actually lead to lower prices. [4] The shift from second degree to AI-driven first-degree price discrimination would be one of the biggest aviation changes in decades. So I went to the Fetcherr website and found surprisingly that it said that its airline AI offerings don’t actually do any of the things Hauenstein was claiming. [5] They don’t collect data about individual customers or analyze the price elasticities or other characteristics of individual customers or fine-tuned customer segments. Fletchrr emphasizes that its AI/data tools are designed to be easily integrated into existing pricing practices and there is absolutely no suggestion they were designed to help an airline to completely reengineer its pricing function. Something is seriously wrong here, but what? Are Delta and/or Fletchrr being less than honest about what they are doing? Major investments in AI tools are only appropriate in cases where a company needs to process massively greater amounts of external data than before and wants to divine correlations that human analysts using PC based software could never find. Large Language Models identify text patterns that can help automate preparation of article summaries and documents. Activity specific models find correlations between millions of historical inputs and outputs that can support the automation of basic tasks like coding or accounting. Two major AI applications are especially relevant here. The primary “get inside the mind of the consumer” case is advertising, where large companies like Google and Facebook used their access to massive amounts of data about individual users to program real-time ads more effectively than traditional human marketing analysts. The primary “use Big Data to totally re-engineer previously human+PC software analytical functions” came in the 1990s when hedge funds used hitherto unprecedented amounts of computing power to find factors correlated with asset price changes that drove more higher average returns and incorporate them into high-speed computerized trading strategies. [6] One possible explanation for these apparent contradictions is that Fletchrr doesn’t understand airline pricing very well. Its founders come from the hedge fund world where AI tools are critical because there are millions of traders, billions of transactions, individual markets are highly volatile, can be influenced by an unpredictable range of external factors, and major traders are constantly changing their strategies. Fletchrr never explains why this experience would apply to airlines where supply and demand are highly stable in the short/medium term, the number of airline competitors is limited and while their pricing approaches can evolve over time they haven’t changed dramatically or unexpectedly in decades. Why did Fletchrr see airlines as a prime target for its AI sales efforts? Because they thought airlines were “outdated” “undisrupted” and had seen few recent technological advances. In fact, airlines were perhaps the non-military industry quickest to drive innovation in operations research, IT technology, and modern pricing/distribution tools, and of course saw business models totally transformed in the last quarter of the 20th Century. They may not seem highly dynamic to someone whose experience is limited to the recent development of hedge fund quant models, but very few industries anywhere experience that rate of technological change. Fletchrr says airlines need AI tools to handle today’s faster rate of change, but the only examples of hard to handle change it offered were nonsensical–the impact of Covid on demand and the challenge of previously unscheduled flights into Doha for the FIFA World Cup. Fletchrr doesn’t provide any concrete examples of major problems it can solve that current pricing systems can’t deal with. The input data for Fletchrr’s AI market model is the exact same input data airline revenue management systems have been using for decades. There might be value in a tool that can quickly process greater volumes of input data; every corporate function could be improved at the margin, and perhaps these gains would justify the IT investment. But these would be marginal improvements, would not represent the complete reengineering of pricing that Delta claimed, or anything that could produce the major revenue/profit impacts that would justify major announcements to investors. Another possible explanation is that Delta executives never thought through the requirements, potential gains and implementation risks of re-engineering its existing systems into personalized/surveillancepricing. Perhaps Delta never bothered to figure out that Fletchrr’s software was only offering marginally greater automation of traditional pricing tasks and never considered that Fletchrr’s software wasn’t designed to drive the dramatic changes it thought its investors would value. Delta hasn’t made any attempt to define the shortcomings in its existing pricing systems that it is hoping to address or explain how a future reengineered system would differ from today’s. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere and never stopped to consider whether the conditions that allowed AI tools to create value in other industries applied here. Perhaps Delta executives more cynically thought that splashy announcements of big AI projects would juice the stock price, would reinforce Delta’s image of having more progressive management than United or Delta, and assumed that investors would never hold management accountable if there wasn’t a big revenue/profit boost. Even if it is I possible that Fletchrr’s hedge fund trained AI experts overestimated the applicability of its tools to airlines and that Delta management accepted too much AI hype it seems rather improbable that both these two sophisticated companies would announce a major effort where the goals were badly misaligned. One more plausible explanation is that Fletchrr fully understands that Delta is determined to achieve first degree price discrimination, and both parties wanted to obscure this. It could be that Fletchrr knew its AI-driven Market Model was well suited for personalized/surveillance pricing but deliberately excluded any mention of this from its promotional material to help shield airline clients from external criticism in cases like this. Fletchrr’s website gives Delta a way to plausibly deny outside critics (“that’s not what these AI tools do!”) without having to formally disavow their pursuit of personalized/surveillance pricing. It could be that Fletchrr’s models were never designed to process huge volumes of personal information but Delta believe they can be adopted to support first degree price discrimination. It remains possible that Delta’s effort to use AI-driven personalized/surveillance pricing will fail to materially boost profitability. The articles reporting Hauenstein’s claim mentioned a range of potential obstacles to personalized/surveillance pricing including the ready availability of data on market (non-personalized) prices that would allow flyers to see if Delta was trying to get them to pay above-market fares. While it is widely understood how Google and Facebook can use terabytes of personal data to tailor ad displays, no one has publicly explained how personal data would allow an airline to calculate price elasticities for each customer and reliably predict that this individual shopping for this specific flight would be willing to pay more than it was asking other customers to pay. It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Many observers assume that first degree price discrimination would require forcing most passengers to not only grant Delta access to much more personal information than they have now, but to force them use Delta-controlled sales channels. A recent American attempt to force corporate agents serving higher yielding passengers to use a captive channel actually reduced revenue by over a billion dollars and was withdrawn. [7] Delta’s best customers might similarly resist any attempt to force them to use a channel that prevented them from seeing what true market rates were. Uber provides a case example of a company where shifting to first degree price discrimination did produce a very large profit boost. Uber previously offered the same fare to any customer and offered the same payment to any driver (based on factors such as distance and time of day) with a system that estimated the highest fare/lowest payments they would accept.[8] But if Delta was attracted to personalized/surveillance pricing by the big profit boost Uber achieved it may be badly disappointed because Delta has none of the structural advantages that allow Uber to maximize exploitive discrimination. Uber rides are last minute purchases and riders have no ability to compare prices. There are no independent Google/Kayak/Expedia-type sources of true market taxi pricing information. Delta frequent flyers understand airline pricing and would quickly figure out if changes were unfavorable. Uber users have no real idea how Uber pricing works, and Uber (and Lyft) have achieved quasi-monopoly pricing power after using billions in predatory subsidies to drive independent competition out of the market. It should be emphasized that the central issue, should Delta have any success pursuing first degree price discrimination is not “AI technology” or “pricing algorithms” but the ability to exploit anti-competitive market power. Simplistic Economics 101 models say producers can’t achieve the capture of consumer surplus that Delta hopes to achieve using first degree price discrimination because consumers would be protected by market competition and the availability of perfect information about market prices. First degree price competition works for Uber because they tightly control all marketplace information, have eliminated all meaningful competition and any ability of elected officials to enforce consumer and labor law protections. Even Uber investors have no ability to see how pricing and driver compensation changes affect profitability. Thus any attempt to implement first degree price discrimination requires subverting the proper workings of competitive markets. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to force its best customers to use Delta controlled distribution channels, or to limit their ability to see if Delta is only showing them fares higher than other customers can get. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to blow off customer backlash, negative publicity and complaints from Congress. The ability to impose first degree price discrimination should perhaps be seen as prima facie evidence that a company has artificial anti-competitive market power. While normal companies that achieved a multi-billion profit recovery would aggressively publicize the brilliance of its management moves, Uber management has gone to great lengths to keep the public from becoming aware that it made a major shift to first order price discrimination and that that shift was the major reason Uber finally became profitable. Uber understands that a greater awareness of passenger/driver exploitation could not only drive serious customer/political backlash but create awareness that its profitability had nothing to do with management brilliance but was driven entirely by the subversion of market competition. Delta might rationally believe that it already has the artificial market power to pursue personalized/surveillance pricing while ignoring the objections of its best customers but Uber management might warn them to take these risks more seriously. American’s CEO has already called Delta’s proposed pricing shift a “bait and switch” plan.

I could very easily see this happening. I travel a lot on Delta, and I believe I have been targeted in this way in recent months. The increase in business class fare offerings has been amazing and I believe that once you’ve shown a willingness to pay $2k for a cross-country seat or $10k for an overseas flight, for a business trip where your dates are not flexible [and you’re being reimbursed], that’s what they’re going to show you for all travel from now on. But I don’t believe they can fill the cabin that way. Many users are sucked into the loyalty program or (like me) limited to certain airlines based on a smaller home airport, but if they’re going to price gouge, and other airlines refrain, I’m going elsewhere. Hopefully the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can save me . . . oh, wait. But if you really think about it, they are mostly targeting the PMC here, so maybe there will be some legislative pushback after all. I don’t know if it’s the result of AI, but something changed with Delta’s domestic pricing recently. I fly the same route regularly, and within the past few weeks the price of the particular ticket I usually buy increased substantially in comparison to other options. The result is (1) for the first time in quite a while I checked Expedia to see what my other options are, and (2) I will buy the cheapest ticket instead of the one I usually buy. I also noticed on my last few flights that the relative number of people boarding in the last (cheapest ticket) group has increased substantially, and the flights are not as full. Maybe that benefits Delta somehow, but I don’t really understand how. Unclear whether what you saw is related to the recently announced software program, which is still in early testing. But it could have been the result of a previous cruder non-AI algorithm Delta was using. As I mentioned it is well understood that frequent travelers fly for a wide variety of reasons over time with widely divergent price elasticities and no one has ever explained how any “personalized” system could afjust prices for each different situation My recommendation to anyone who thinks they have been a victim of first degree price discrimination is to quickly look up fares on an internet travel agency (Kayak, Expedia, etc) or signin to Delta with the ID of a spouse/friend who doesn’t have a similar usage of full-fare/premium tickets. Take screen shots. If its clear you’ve been offered a higher-than-market fare, complain to Delta with a “why are you trying to gouge me?” email After I wrote the comment I had my wife look up the same itinerary on her phone. The particular ticket I usually buy was significantly less than was offered to me, while the other fares were the same. I went back to double check and I was still being offered the higher rate. They will now have some solid information about my elasticity. The airlines are presumably not the only ones who can play this high tech arbitrage game, and they could wind up hoisted on their own petards. What is to stop some enterprising young nerdbox from developing a bot with the profile that would cause it to be offered the lowest price, and then buy up all the tickets for a given flight and sell them on the secondary market? If it can be done with tickets to concerts and sporting events, why not plane tickets too? When you buy a plane ticket you have to enter your passport or some form of ID. The ticket is not transferable. At least this is my experience. Nice thought though! Turning the tides on them and all Huh? Not in the US or when I buy international tix to Southeast Asia. I provide the passport # only at check in time. Expat2uruguay, I haven’t traveled much since 9-11, so my memory of buying tickets for travel and procedures at the airport when one is checking in is quite rusty. I did a cursory search on transferability of tickets and found that most airlines don’t allow it, and the few that do generally charge fees to do a name change. Sometimes the fee itself can be so expensive that it makes more sense to purchase a new ticket for the person who will actually be flying. Regardless, the person showing up for the flight has to produce an acceptable-to-TSA I.D. which matches the name on the ticket. That alone would preclude the idea that lyman alpha blob proposed. Hope this helps. I booked a flight to the UK for October and have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization, which I did not have to do when I flew there last year. https://www.gov.uk/eta They want photos of my passport and of my face. Not surprised. Last time I renewed my UK passport they demanded to see my other passports. Rather than send sensitive data electronically (which I don’t think is their business anyway) I paid to travel by train to their UK hub office and simply showed them my Aussie passport making sure they couldn’t take pics of complete info. While maybe the AI will make it worse but fare manipulation has been know about for years if not decades. What day of the week you look or buy, did you look recently, and location etc all of which means you’re presented with higher prices. I know I’ve seen this happen to me before. And definitely not for biz/first class. > It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Patently false. My former mentor (Louviere) made his name originally by doing PRECISELY this for Qantas in the early 1980s using (what were at that point pretty primitive) discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and often used the very bad “conjoint analysis” techniques which he later freely disavowed calling most of his early 1980s research “crap and not worth reading”. But DCEs have been used to map demand functions for years, and these days with the rise of the web and online panels, map them under all those different types of contexts mentioned. The most successful applications are not ones you’ll find referenced….I’ve mentioned before the one that flew under even our radar (macquarie bank’s use of them which I discovered by accident). It’s such cases that should really worry people. My point that individual elasticities cannot be measured was in the context of an airline booking system that has to deal with millions and millions of booking/fare inquiries and needs to decide instantaneously what to show to each specific individual. My dubiousness reflects some familiarity with attempts in the past (perhaps including the QF example you cited) that were totally useless plus some other issues. What I’d seen in the past wasn’t based on individuals but on market segment categories, e.g. investment bankers, salespeople, government employees, people who attended a given trade fair every year) with the aggregate elasticity estimate applied to anyone placed in that category. Also useless in real world airline pricing. But if you have any studies that purport to estimate individual elasticities in a large scale operational setting that you think might be somewhat legitimate, please let me know Thanks for engaging. I’ll clarify as much as I can. As you might have guessed, a load of Louviere’s work with Qantas was not published as it was commercially sensitive. The stuff that WAS published (like the “conjoint” stuff using rating scales) was garbage (as subsequently said by the man himself). Thus if you want a good well known empirical example there is one which won the “Nobel” in Economics: Dan McFadden’s construction of the demand curve for the (not even yet built) BART in SF Bay Area, based on a synthesis of revealed preference data (what choices people ACTUALLY made in real life) PLUS stated preference data (what they’d do when given hypothetical but realistic scenarios). McFadden’s results were proven correct once BART was built. It is the ultimate example of how we can map out the demand function pretty easily, if you put in the work. Online panels make it trivially easy. My worry here was the siloisation of academia: nobody looking into other fields to see if something had been solved there. DCEs are sometimes criticised because the respondents aren’t sufficiently familiar with the options on offer. Most passengers on flights know exactly what everything entails and I designed surveys to give real time results on people’s trade-offs. The “what to show an individual” is trivial and I have zero doubt that big airlines have been using DCE data to do this for YEARS. We’ve gone WAY beyond the market segment objection you made. I can model individuals. I don’t need to use ANY inter-individual data or inferences. I describe this in my book. We were doing this over 10 years ago with no AI. PS AI is actually not the “big bad wolf” here. By its very nature it scrapes existing data (flight characteristics) already out there. In other words, it uses data from what traditional economists would recognise as the production possibility frontier and the points that actually got “activated” by intersections with the demand curve. Points that are currently not implemented (think of the iPhone just before its launch) cannot be modeled using AI data. People don’t yet know enough about the product characteristics and if you scrape existing data on characteristics of existing phones (think those stylus Windows phones up to 2009ish) then you’ll get horridly confounded estimates. The “artificial but realistic” data from a DCE is essential (and I stress again, following proper education of the respondents about what it could potentially do) in estimating demand surfaces (since we’re in multi dimensional space). The issue of price discrimination should’ve been addressed 15 years ago when my old industry learnt how to do it brilliantly and way before AI. Indeed AI should be criticised for loads of reasons but this is not a valid one. We shot ourselves in the foot years ago. I think they will because people really want to travel and have proven themselves to put up with any kind of humiliation from airlines and ”security checks”. Somewhat related, airlines make their money on their loyalty programs and credit cards. The high transaction fees make this work. Using points for tickets has become more challenging as airlines mostly use dynamic pricing for award tickets. Some now require login to display award pricing, so surveillance pricing is likely active for some. Data: US Airlines Operate As Loss Leaders For Their Loyalty Programs OMAAT Delta had a 10.5% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -2.5% margin United had an 8.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -1.9% margin American had a 4.8% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -8.3% margin Alaska had a 4.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -11.4% margin Southwest had a 1.2% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -19.9% margin The US carriers are all terrible now. They should take lessons from the big Asian or the ME3 airlines. I’m so old I remember fares printed in ink in schedules. And economy was a pleasant experience. Thank you Jimmy Carter for neoliberal crapification! Generally I agree but Ryanair was different. I don’t actually think it deserves the bad rap it gets. Not ACROSS THE BOARD anyway. I used it quite a bit 2009-2015 when I was living down under but attending Euro conferences (with trips to family tagged on). On the “non-bucket-holiday routes” I never had problems. You got what you paid for and expected. It was only the routes (often UK to certain popular holiday destinations) frequented by drunken idiots from my own home country of UK that made the flight awful. Ryanair has, IIRC remained profitable or at least not get hit anything like as bad as other carriers even in bad years like 2020. Of course I do wonder if an increasing amount of their profit comes from the abominable scratch cards etc they push on you….. It has been six years since I last flew commercial. Don’t miss it at all! The last airfare I paid was for vacation with son’s family, Granpa needed to be with Grandkids. Otherwise, too much business travel makes me rather drive 30 hours Thanks for this post. Thank Hubert! Whether prices are set by humans or AI, consumers will only purchase tickets if they consider the price to be reasonable. Regarding Uber and Lyft some anecdotal experience. I have found checking prices between them that Lyft is usually cheaper and when speaking to the drivers they get a higher percentage of the fare. In a recent situation my daughter used Uber and at the end of her ride the driver asked her what the fare was (as the driver couldn’t see it) and offered a $10 discount for a direct payment which my daughter did and the driver canceled the ride which resulted in no charge through the app. In major city airports there are taxi stands that often are significantly cheaper than using uber and readily available. I expect these work arounds will expand in time. In addition Waymo etc… is much cheaper and will also start cutting into Uber and Lyft’s profits. (No pesky driver to pay). As far as surveillance pricing for airlines and grocery stores I expect a great deal of on the ground resistance. Just as a reference point on AI… this is NOT intelligence or even ARTIFICIAL intelligence. As I and others keep pointing out this is not “intelligence” as people general think. This is just MASSIVE computing power. Companies have been doing this type of pricing, marketing and targeting for years! However, connecting a customer and his personal data (customer provided at the POS and ACQUIRED from other 3rd party sources) and computing a pricing target at the POS has only been a dream until recently. This is not “intelligence” this is massive computing power of data in a real-time fashion against a developed statistical model. Yes, the outputs may make senses for maximizing profits, but the pricing points do not come from any computer intelligence as we would recognize. That said, it doesn’t mean we’re screwed, but the elite have always been dreaming of that, how else are they to pay for their lifestyle. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere… Almost certainly this is the explanation. Horan, bless his heart, assumes that decisions about AI are made on the basis of hard-headed technical analyses. What we have been seeing in fact is that companies are adopting AI strictly out of a fear of missing out or being last to the party regarding the technology they don’t understand. This process is accelerated by the two or three companies that are pushing AI for all its worth. Fetchrr is clearly looking for ways to sell its snake oil to large businesses before the whole AI bubble collapses. Well, one advantage of government travel was GSA had contracted rates for just about anywhere you would need to go. Sometimes you could finesse this — flying from Oxnard CA to DC the contract was with United, but an option was a one-way car rental to LAX and American had the LAX-DCA contract. Way back when I was stationed in Crystal City in VA (how the Navy got kicked out of Main Navy on Constitution Ave and ended up in leased space in Arlington is a question for another day) I was a member of a locker room facility we used for jogging at lunch. There were some guys from US Air who were usually there (at the time they had some sort of offices at National) and they would always be discussing among themselves how airline X had changed its pricing on a certain route and how US Air should react. I guess from the days before software took it all over. Back then Piedmont had a monopoly on DC to Norfolk or Newport News flights, and it was always a question if it was better to drive it than fly. Google flights has served me well as it tracks price fluctuations anonymously. Price wars are quite evident there. I buy separate one-way tickets to fly round-trip US coast-to-coast every few months domestically. My “status” usually gets me front-economy seats on AA with some leg room and one free checked bag. Good enough even with AA’s ongoing deterioration to not bother with competition. Thankfully I no longer must fly to SA and Oz occasionally for work, and I can plan domestic trips several months in advance. it’s long been rumoured (long before “a/i” was a thing) that surfing with a mac usually results in higher prices than with a windows or linux machine. with my main browser, i used to spoof my user agent string. never proved a thing. cuz the user agent isn’t the only data used? who knows?

Title: As if the trade war never happened, stocks could pull off a feat not seen since the late-1990s boom

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The stock market has been on a hot streak lately, notching record high after record high, and some bulls on Wall Street think the party isn’t over. That marks a stunning reversal from the panic that gripped investors in April, when President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs shocked the world. Stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar crashed. Markets started pricing in a recession, and analysts slashed their forecasts. But Trump put his most aggressive tariff rates on hold, corporate earnings remained robust, consumers stayed resilient, and stocks rebounded. Even foreign investors jumped back into U.S. markets. Meanwhile, his administration has negotiated several trade deals, including one with the European Union on Sunday that removes the threat of a damaging trade war. Now that the fog of war is lifting, upbeat forecasts that predated Liberation Day are back, meaning stocks could put up big numbers again—as if the tariff shock from a few months ago was all just a bad dream. On Monday, Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus hiked his S&P 500 price target for this year to 7,100 from 5,950, reinstating the outlook he initially made in December 2024. “This year reminds us of the classic Charles Dickens quote, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'” he said in his latest note. “Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes at least for now.” He cited progress on trade negotiations, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve’s deft handling of monetary policy, which cooled inflation without causing a recession. If the S&P 500 hits 7,100 this year, it would represent a gain of about 21% for 2025, marking a third straight year with a surge of more than 20%. That hasn’t happened since the late 1990s, when the U.S. economy and the stock market boomed. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the S&P 500 could reach 7,200 by mid-2026, explaining that he is starting to lean closer to that more optimistic “bull case” scenario. He cited strong earnings as well as AI adoption, the weak dollar, Trump’s tax cuts, pent-up demand, and expectations for Fed rate cuts in early 2026. Another member of the 7,000 club is Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, who has stuck by his S&P 500 forecast of 7,007 even during the trade war. Last week, he reaffirmed it, predicting big tech companies will continue fueling the stock market’s rally despite Trump’s trade policies. “What we’re seeing is the winners continue to win,” he told Bloomberg. “The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trend in AI that will continue.” And over the longer term, this decade still looks like it will be another “roaring 20s,” according to market veteran Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. On Monday, he backed his thesis, which he first posited in August 2020, as productivity advances, a wave of capital outlays, and the endurance of consumer spending will keep stocks buoyant. “If the remainder of the decade continues to play out as the Roaring 2020s, we predict that the S&P 500 will start the next decade at 10,000,” Yardeni wrote in a note. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Somnath Mukherjee: Sebi’s Jane Street order was the canary our market needed

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arbitrage or market manipulation? Jane Street believes it is an uber-efficient arbitrageur. It spotted pricing anomalies between index options and the index’s stock constituents, and used sophisticated trading models to profit from the arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) order has some interesting findings. On 17 January 2024, the expiry day for Bank Nifty derivatives, the index opened 2% lower due to weak earnings of some of its constituents. However, options on the Bank Nifty traded at a level where the implied price was higher, resulting in an anomalous price spread. JS did what textbooks tell us: buy stocks that make up the Bank Nifty while selling options on this index. The trade worked as textbooks say it would: the spread narrowed within six minutes. But here’s the twist: the total value of Bank Nifty stocks purchased was ₹572 crore while the total notional value of the options sold was ₹8,751 crore, which is more than 15 times. This oddity continued. By mid-day, JS had bought Bank Nifty stocks and futures worth over ₹5,000 crore and sold options worth over ₹30,000 crore. Arbitrage is about hedging, but one doesn’t hedge a bet on India winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by placing 15 bets on India not-winning it. So JS started selling its stock/futures positions. But liquidity in these segments is so low that its trades tanked prices, resulting in losses for JS in its long index positions. But its large short options position (5-6 times in notional exposure to its cash/futures positions) got settled at market close at a massive profit. In short, JS appeared to move prices in the illiquid leg of the market (cash/futures) so that it could profit from its large position in the liquid leg (options). Also Read: Devina Mehra: How derivative dreams can turn into nightmares but still lure investors Arbitrage or manipulation? Either way, Sebi’s order has acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine to reveal potentially poisonous fumes in our capital markets. Fume 1—Lopsided market structure: India’s equity market is the second largest among emerging economies by market capitalization and volumes both. However, volumes are skewed—over 90% are in derivatives (futures and options or F&O), with options accounting for the bulk. The cash segment is shallow. Daily volumes in the shares of HDFC Bank, the largest Bank Nifty constituent, for instance, are only about ₹2,000 crore. To put this in context, the total equity assets under management of India’s mutual funds (MFs) are over ₹30 trillion, with ₹50-60,000 crore worth of flows every month. This skew causes distortions. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Jane Street’s secret sauce for Indian markets should be tested out Fume 2—Skewed tax structure: A small ₹5,000 crore trade could move prices because there is no countervailing Indian entity that’s able to provide liquidity by playing the other side of JS’s ‘arbitrage’ trades. The reason is simple—tax rules. In India, the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives is a fraction of what it is on stocks, incentivizing investors to move to F&O from the cash segment. Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) enjoy a large tax advantage over Indians. FPIs’ F&O trades qualify for capital-gains tax (and are taxed at 20% if short-term and 12.5% if long-term), but for Indian entities, the same gains are deemed to be income (taxed at 25% for corporates and 39% for individuals/trusts). Fume 3—Regulation stifles Indian institutions: For many years, FPIs provided the dominant share of liquidity in Indian stock markets. Over the last decade, Indian institutions, especially MFs, have risen in stature and now account for a larger share of India’s market capitalization and volumes than FPIs. This provides a diversified pool of liquidity in the cash segment. But in the F&O segment, a regulatory overhang prevents the creation of such counterweight liquidity. Why? Also Read: Jane Street: Gaming an outdated system is not necessarily illegal in India First, domestic institutional investors are mostly not allowed to use leverage, but FPIs are. Second, short-selling, which lets market participants act on bearish views, exists mostly in the realm of theory; its process is such that participation and liquidity are low. Third, a prudential aversion to leverage has left F&O trading as its only source. Bank lending to capital markets is heavily circumscribed and non-banking financial companies have limited capacity to lend. This reduces domestic market liquidity and pushes participants towards the F&O segment. Fourth, while there are all sorts of limits in equity markets, index options face none. This means participants can build positions in index options many times the stock position limits on the underlying stocks. Fifth, a very high proportion of market liquidity is concentrated in short-term options contracts. India is unique as a large market with zero liquidity in derivatives of more than three months tenor. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street interim order made India’s stock market sit up for good reason Solutions are within grasp: India’s financial markets are world class. So are its regulators (think of Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India). Diversified liquidity is the lifeblood of any well-functioning market. Small tweaks in tax laws, alongside a rethink on the flexibility afforded to Indian institutions (especially MFs) would be a great fresh start. The appointment of market-makers for longer-dated derivatives is another idea that is well-tested in India; in the 1990s, RBI licensed a slew of primary dealers as market-makers for government bonds with great results. India’s capital markets are valuable. Sebi has done its bit as the canary by highlighting emergent risks. It is time now to make space for fresh ideas so that the mine continues to prosper for India.

Title: Fast food fixer: 83-year-old Hungry Jack wants a five-minute plan for Domino’s Pizza

Some Australians might know that the man behind burger chain Hungry Jack’s is Jack Cowin. Another name for him could be Australia’s Burger King, given he owns the local rights to the brand. He has shaped vast swaths of the fast-food landscape, having brought KFC to Australia and being chairman of Domino’s Pizza, in which he is its biggest investor. At 83, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion, you might think the Canadian-born entrepreneur is enjoying retirement. The reality is the opposite. Cowin has taken over chief executive duties at Domino’s following a string of executive exits. The day after the resignation of global chief executive Mark van Dyck (who was seven months into the job) was announced, Cowin hosted a call to field questions from investors and analysts. Make no mistake: Domino’s chairman, now executive chairman, Jack Cowin is calling the shots at the pizza chain.Credit: Dan Peled “This company is not in disarray. The future, in my opinion, is bright,” Cowin declared. “There’s nothing wrong with this base business.” Zooming from his desk in a dark teal jumper, the billionaire businessman conceded a number of key issues that needed to be fixed, picking problems with each departed company chief. He wanted decisions made faster than van Dyck’s plan to do it – in five minutes, preferably, not five years. He also made no secret of his intention to wind back decisions made by van Dyck’s predecessor. “The Don Meij era was growth,” he said. Meij said his reason for leaving was the “sheer intensity” of being at the helm for 22 years. He once topped the charts as the highest-paid ASX chief executive. But under Meij’s watch, Cowin said too many new stores set up in countries such as Luxembourg, France, Japan have been loss-making for too long. “We have to correct that.” From left: Don Meij, Mark van Dyck and Jack Cowin.Credit: Peter Wallis But the conditions for success during that era were some of the best the pizza chain could have wished for. COVID-19 lockdowns keeping everyone at home created huge – but temporary – demand for food delivery. Fast-food customers and investors alike were grabbing a slice of Domino’s, which reached a share price record high of nearly $160 in September 2021. Since then, it hasn’t capitalised on the flash-in-the-pan success. Pizza sales have stalled. Profit predictions were downgraded three times in a year. “It has been this huge growth story for a long time. The last two or three years hasn’t [delivered] any growth,” said Tom Kierath, investment banking firm Barrenjoey’s head of consumer research. Investors fled the stock after van Dyck’s resignation was announced, sending the share price to little over a tenth of that peak to $16.96. Cowin was aware of the need to reassure rattled shareholders, with van Dyck’s departure coming so soon after Meij’s. The billionaire businessman has a personal stake – 25.7 per cent – in fixing this. “The business has got to do better. We’re custodians of other people’s money,” Cowin said. “But to make this business successful, we have to have growth, and we have to do it now rather than on a long-term basis.” Domino’s problems didn’t appear overnight. Many competitive edges that once made it a market leader have eroded over years. Meij sought to make Domino’s website and app best-in-class, spending nearly $23 million in half a year alone on digital platforms. The investment doesn’t appear to have generated high returns. “You had the Peloton bubble, you had the Lululemon bubble with everyone buying casual wear, and we had this Domino’s bubble because they were digitally well advanced beyond anyone else,” said food industry consultant and Titanium Food director Suzee Brain. “That gave them inflated confidence that they were the new flavour of the month. So they started some really massive expansion off the back of a false economy.” The rapid store roll-out across Europe and Asia, once a major sales driver, was reversing. In Australia, Domino’s couldn’t keep the sales spurt they enjoyed during the pandemic. Executive chairman Jack Cowin is unwinding a number of investments decisions made by former CEO Don Meij.Credit: Jamila Toderas “They weren’t able to keep a lot of those customers, because there’s another problem: the product is not all that great,” said Brain. “They’ve never marketed it because they make great pizza … But now, it actually needs to be about the pizza.” Domino’s is facing a more competitive and diverse fast-food landscape in which players such as Guzman y Gomez and El Jannah are attracting younger customers and US chains Five Guys and Wingstop are keen for their slice of the market. As Australia’s dominant pizza chain, industry watchers believe Domino’s must advocate more effectively for the entire pizza category. “As part of your ‘what we do for the kids for a family eating Sunday evening dinner’ [considerations], does Domino’s become part of the conversation more than it currently is? That’s the opportunity,” said one industry analyst who declined to be named. The business must become more profitable, Cowin has told investors. Ideally, this would happen through a sales uplift, but as there’s no guarantee of that, costs need to be pulled out of the business. As delivery aggregators Uber Eats and DoorDash eat Domino’s lunch, IT spending has been an early target. “Our technology is not any better than Uber’s and the other people that we have to deal with,” said Cowin. “If you don’t have a competitive advantage, let’s stop trying to recreate the wheel.” Franchisee profitability is a key priority for Domino’s, with weekly store sales ranging from $30,000 to $100,000, Cowin revealed. But margins were eroded by the spurt of high inflation across ingredients such as cheese as well as wages, fuel and electricity. Meij tried to pass this on by imposing a 6 per cent delivery fee, which backfired with customers who punished the move by buying fewer pizzas. “Relative price point becomes very important,” said Ten Cap co-founder and lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu. “This price increase for the fast-food category was just so wrong.” Several fund managers, stock pickers and analysts believe at least some dead weight needs to be shed. Domino’s should sell France and exit Japan, said outspoken stockbroker Angus Aitken. Barrenjoey’s Keirath agrees. “If they get Taiwan, right, is it going to move the dial? No, it’s becoming a distraction. The same in Malaysia,” he said. “What you do by staying in those markets is you dilute the core markets.” Recruitment is under way for Van Dyck’s replacement. But they will have to be someone who will have to play by the rules laid out by Cowin, who has made it clear he wants to see rapid change. “If you have a strong chair in place [who has] already said to the market, ‘well, that guy is not there because he’s not delivering on costs’, then the next person has to subscribe to that view,” said Ten Cap’s Liu. “When you have to focus on costs, you got to be a tough person. You can’t be a nice guy.” There are plenty who think Domino’s is still a good deal, such as Morningstar equity analyst Johannes Faul, who said the leadership instability has injected uncertainty in the short term but described the pizza chain as “a robust brand of the future”. “We do think Domino’s still has growth ahead of it. Quite significantly so,” Faul said. Aitken said there was still a “huge mass market” for Domino’s products. “The demise of Domino’s as a product is not apparent to us,” he said. “We think backing the No.1 [quick-service restaurant] money-maker over 50 years, when he has no friends, is a great time to back Jack Cowin and Domino’s.” Turning things around could take three years. “Jack might be in his 80s but he is hands-on and can fix this with the right team.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, which trades under the ETHA ticker, just became the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion. It reached the milestone in 251 days. And was beat by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund—which did it in 34 days and 53 days, respectively. There was much hand wringing and head scratching on Wall Street when the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 didn’t get the kind of reaction as Bitcoin ETFS did in January 2024. We’re talking $1 billion in trading volume for ETH funds’ debut vs. $4.5 billion for Bitcoin. But investors don’t seem worried or confused now. Looking ahead, there’s reason to believe the growth of crypto ETFs could accelerate even more. Analysts recently told Decrypt that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers are likely to get the nod from the SEC to offer in-kind redemption and creation of shares. That would mean shares could be purchased with BTC or ETH—whichever happens to be the underlying asset—and that investors could receive BTC or ETH when they redeem their shares. The feature is popular with investors, but regulators are concerned the process is complex and could pose security concerns in crypto-based funds. Bitcoin glutton Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is back in the market raising cash to buy even more Bitcoin—this time with a new preferred stock offering that could add another $2.5 billion to its war chest. At the time of writing, Strategy’s 607,770 Bitcoin is currently worth $70.6 billion with a 1,519.17% in unrealized profit after adding another $739.8 million to its holdings on Monday. The company initially said it would raise $500 million with its new Stretch preferred stock offering, selling 5 million shares at $100 a pop. Then news got out (initially reported by Bloomberg) that the company would expand its offering to $2 billion. When the SEC filing finally hit EDGAR on Friday, it became clear the company intends to raise closer to $2.5 billion with its new Stretch preferred stock offering. Meanwhile, there’s a new class‑action lawsuit brewing over how Strategy amended terms for its Strike preferred stock offering. The company acknowledged in a July 21 filing that a plaintiff has filed a class action lawsuit alleging that holders of MSTR common stock ought to have been given a chance to vote on a July 7 amendment made to the Strike offering. Speaking of class action lawsuits: The July 15 deadline has passed for a judge to choose a lead plaintiff in the other Strategy class action lawsuit over statements made by executives about the risks involved in its Bitcoin treasury. Issuing debt to buy Bitcoin hits different when it's a Bitcoin miner. At least that’s what can be deduced from the way MARA Holdings saw its share price tumble when execs announced an $850 million raise on Wednesday. The stock slipped again on Thursday, when an SEC filing revealed the company upsized its offering to $950 million. The BTC the miner already holds in its treasury—second only to Strategy’s stash—is currently worth $5.8 billion. That puts its Bitcoin holdings nearly even with the company’s intraday market cap, which is $6 billion at the time of writing. But the company isn’t just going to buy Bitcoin with the proceeds of its raise. It wrote in its SEC filing that it plans to use a portion of the new cash for “working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of existing assets, and repayment of additional debt and other outstanding obligations.” All told, MARA shares look to be ending the week 12% lower than they started it, having gone from $19.98 per share to $17.15 at the time of writing. But Compass Point analysts see the dip as a minor issue. Early Friday, Compass Point analyst Ed Engel upgraded MARA from Sell to Neutral and nearly doubled his price target from $9.50 to $18. But he did caution in a note shared with Decrypt that the investors should expect to see some “pullback during seasonally weak August.” The upgrade is largely driven by Bitcoin’s recent performance, he added—but that’s not all. “While most miners are transitioning to HPC,” he wrote, referring to high-performance computing, “MARA seems committed to its HODL strategy that prioritizes ATM and convertible debt sales over selling BTC.” He also noted that while the company has increasingly used its BTC holdings in yield-generating strategies—approximately 15%, by Engel's count—”MARA has yet to disclose any ROI.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Nothing Phone 3 Review: A Quirky and Fun Phone for Photographers

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As a brand hailing from Britain, Nothing has been around since 2020, and the Phone 3 is its first true flagship aimed at taking on the best in the industry. The company’s name is a wide-open door for puns, but nevertheless, Nothing could be a serious contender in the Android space going forward. Its current rise reminds me a lot of the earlier years of OnePlus, which isn’t all that surprising since both were founded by the same man, Carl Pei. He left OnePlus and started up Nothing as a grassroots alternative in a similar vein. This is a first for me, as I hadn’t tested a Nothing phone prior to this, and one with a daring camera setup makes for an ideal start. The Phone 3 is readily available in North America starting at $800, yet also has the pedigree of Chinese brands to some extent. How it all comes together yields intriguing and vexing results. The Phone 3’s physical design is open to interpretation. Does it look like a science experiment or a crafty take on otherwise common builds from others? For my eyes, it’s a unique look that’s easy enough to cover up with a case if a little too eccentric, though I personally don’t mind it at all. I also appreciate that Nothing includes a basic silicone case in the box to add some protection from the start, retaining the transparent back’s visibility with Gorilla Glass Victus offering its own layer of durability. Another unique element is the small red square that is actually an LED that lights up when recording video. One of the standout design elements is what Nothing calls its Glyph Interface, a circular LED display on the top corner that functions almost as an independent system. By default, it tells the time, stopwatch, and timer, battery level, and an odd spin-the-bottle game. It can do much more when making adjustments in the settings to include volume indicators, charging progress, and tying certain glyph animations to specific apps. For instance, you have one for WhatsApp, another for Uber, and yet another for email. I wasn’t able to create one for the Camera app that actually worked, so it’s more of a boon to the rest of the phone. Certainly a gimmicky feature, to a degree, but I’ve grown to like it because it makes it easier to leave the phone face down. The fact I can also set a “rule” for an animation to pop up when a specific contact messages me is convenient, though my smartwatch can effectively do the same thing in real time. On the flip side, the 6.77-inch AMOLED display (2800 x 1260) is gorgeous, with an adaptive refresh rate that will ramp up to 120Hz or down to 10Hz depending on what you’re doing onscreen. Peak brightness (for HDR content) hits 4,500 nits. While pretty visible in bright sunlight, it’s also fairly reflective, so a mixed bag in that regard. A responsive fingerprint sensor makes it relatively easy to bypass the lock screen. With IP68 dust and water resistance, this is Nothing’s first phone you can submerge in clear water, making it far less risky to capture some stills or clips at a pool or lake. Nothing also makes a curious choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor over the 8 Elite other Android flagships adopted this year. Indeed, Qualcomm refers to the 8s Gen 4 chip as an “affordable flagship”, which is marketing speak for a step down in performance, but it’s also more in line with other devices in this price range. A 5,150mAh battery is adequate for a device this size, and it holds up quite well in daily real-world conditions, consistently lasting a full day. Configurations start at 12GB of RAM and 256GB and go up to 16GB and 512GB, respectively. The 50-megapixel main camera (24mm equivalent) uses the same OmniVision OV50H Type 1/1.3-inch sensor as the Vivo X Fold 3 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. The f/1.7 aperture is also in line with both devices, so we have an idea of what to expect from it. Unless you shoot at full resolution, all photos are downsampled to 12.5 megapixels through pixel binning. The 50-megapixel telephoto (70mm equivalent) goes with the Samsung Isocell JN5 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with f/2.7 aperture — one we’ve seen in a myriad of phones over the last three years. In certain modes, Nothing offers a 6x hybrid zoom 140mm equivalent that’s basically a crop of the telephoto’s focal range. While you can shoot at full resolution at 3x (70mm), you can’t do it zooming in further than that. Otherwise, you have to settle for pixel-binned 12.5-megapixel shots. Finally, the 50-megapixel ultra-wide uses the Samsung Isocell JN1 Type 1/2.76-inch sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, a sensor that is fairly common among other brands. Unlike the other two rear lenses, this one isn’t stabilized and is fixed focus, limiting its versatility. This also applies to the 50-megapixel front camera, which uses the exact same sensor and specs. Instead of a separate mode for shooting full-resolution images, you select the resolution from the drop-down menu. The problem is that it inevitably resets to the lower resolution after a while with no warning, so if you’re walking around snapping photos along the way, you’re forced to double-check that 50MP capture is still active. This happened to me a few times, and I was lucky enough to catch it without losing the high-res capture I wanted. Unfortunately, that’s the only way to go full-res, since Expert mode only lets you shoot in RAW with pixel binning. This can pay dividends in low-light conditions, but otherwise feels pointless in brighter settings or when capturing a dramatic landscape. For a flagship, it feels far too limiting. Nothing presents a few interesting software elements that can affect how you take photos with the Phone 3. Tap the bottom arrow in the camera app, and various presets appear in a menu, including Black and White Film, Retro, Soft Focus, and Lenticular. What’s really neat is it lets you import or create your own. To import, simply scan the QR code to add it to the list. Another way is to create a .cube file to bring in a LUT or preset from apps like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve (among others) by uploading it directly from the phone’s camera app. Simply select the filter menu from the drop-down menu, tap the + icon and you have the ability to bring it in, either from local storage or pulled in from Google Drive. Yet another option is to create a preset from any photo, even if you’ve transferred or downloaded it from elsewhere. Why make all this available? The phone’s Gallery app has a decent editing toolset, except it lacks any sort of curve tool or deeper color grading. I tried this out in different ways, one of which was to use the Gallery app first, upload to Lightroom to work on the finer details more accurately, and then download the result back to the phone. That way, I could create a preset using the color grading that the phone and its imaging pipeline would then work to emulate. While not a perfect solution, it is one of the more interesting methodologies I’ve seen that caters to mobile photographers of all stripes. It’s also the most creative outlet in a device that otherwise ignores AI-driven editing features or special modes. The Phone 3 isn’t devoid of AI, however, and one feature tied to the Essential Key — the button under the power button on the phone — is applicable to photography. Press the button with anything onscreen and you can write down a note or ask a question for context. This is great for two reasons. First, it makes it a lot easier to snap a quick photo as a reminder or to look something up. Second, it opens up access to contextual information with the assistance of ChatGPT. To test out a good example, I used a photo I took of the lunar eclipse and asked it when the next eclipse would be. It then listed the upcoming dates for both partial and full lunar eclipses based on my location. It’s true that Google’s Circle to Search essentially does the same thing, only the key difference here is that all of these Essential Key screenshots save to the Essential Spaces app. It essentially (pun intended) acts as an offline resource that’s always there to reference anytime. Granted, it’s far from perfect, as evidenced by the fact that it doesn’t always offer much insight, but it can be great at helping find information. On the other hand, ask it to suggest how to make a photo look better, and it won’t offer much insight at all. I will address the two main sticking points for the camera before discussing the positives. There’s a noticeable shutter lag that afflicts every mode except Action and Video. In some cases, it’s so bad that it can take up to two full seconds before it snaps the image. It’s also inconsistent in ways that are hard to discern or explain. I could never figure out why it would be slow to capture a photo in outdoor settings, only to feel much more instantaneous when taking other shots in the same general area. I will update this review once Nothing responds to queries, but if I were to take a stab at it, I would guess that the HDR processing engine immediately sets how many images it needs to quickly snap and merge. The other issue is lens flare and ghosting. Nothing needs to look at whatever coating it’s using for the Phone 3’s lenses because it happens in varying scenarios where it doesn’t impact other phones in the same spots. The photo of the rabbit is a good example of how it can create glare that not only hazes the composition but also plants ugly ghosting in the frame. All I was trying to do was lower the perspective to get a more interesting shot, but the flaring never let up. Meanwhile, two competitors’ phones didn’t seem to suffer from the same problem. Nothing has just released a firmware update to improve its Ultra XDR processing and address this issue. I’ll update this review if that leads to better results. Those two significant drawbacks aside, the Phone 3 surprised me in good ways, with the Action mode turning out to be one of the biggest gems. Nothing wisely offers it in both the main and telephoto cameras, and much like other competing phones with a similar feature, the idea here is to increase shutter speed and utilize HDR processing to manipulate both ISO and virtual aperture to freeze everything. Tougher lighting conditions get in the way, yet broad daylight can lead to fabulous results. The skateboarder is a good example — not only did I take the shot with the telephoto lens, I also cropped in further and retained good detail. Action doesn’t support burst shooting (only Photo mode does), but quickly tapping the shutter can deliver multiple good shots. Equally impressive is the way the Phone 3 handles HDR, although time of day and light exposure play a significant role. It may struggle to pull out the blues in the sky on a bright sunny vista, only to then wonderfully subdue the sun’s intensity in a horizon sunset. When it works well, you love having that kind of power in your pocket, despite how it cuts both ways. One thing I appreciate is that the Phone 3 handles exposed light sources well enough to avoid outright clipping or underexposing shadows — again, owing to the Ultra XDR’s efficacy. However, the angle is your only real defense against flare or glare creeping in, so tilting ever so slightly might be enough to ward it off in those instances because it can happen indoors or outdoors. General results will look great on a phone screen, though you may notice more imperfections when pixel peeping. It’s one of those things where really good photos are obvious and forgettable clunkers equally so. That’s not to say the Phone 3 is inconsistent, more that it nudges you to use some of the available tools to close the gap. The telephoto lens is a great example of what I’m referring to, mainly because it sometimes captures brilliance and then mediocrity all in one sitting. It impresses more often than not, but I would like to see more consistency. For one thing, you could take two shots from the same vantage point and come out with different color tones in each. Blue skies are the most obvious example of when this happens, though other rich examples, like foliage, vehicles, and graffiti, can lead to similar results. Despite all that, I leaned heavily on the telephoto to get me the shots I wanted from a distance. Even the 10x hybrid zoom (240mm equivalent) can produce a decent result with the help of AI Zoom when it kicks in. It also doubles as a macro shooter and accords itself well in that role. Rich and detailed, it’s one of the more surprising elements to the broader camera system. This ultra-wide sensor has been around for a while, and it shows. The lack of both OIS and broader focusing tend to affect performance but it’s more that the XDR processing just isn’t as effective here. While it is a 50-megapixel sensor, Nothing doesn’t let you shoot with it in full-res where you might salvage some detail in good lighting. Apart from the LUTs and presets, this is one of the main anchors for the camera system. It can produce action shots that simply aren’t possible on an iPhone or Samsung phone without doing a lot more work. Action mode takes both multiple photos and a super short video clip in the backend to help render a still that freezes a subject in motion. We’ve seen this sort of thing from OnePlus, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor before, but it’s yet to truly catch on from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google. As I noted earlier, it’s also the fastest shutter available on the camera app. Rapidly pressing the button enables you to capture the action in fairly short intervals — under a second long — to increase the chance of capturing something dynamic. The one caveat is the subject’s speed. People and (most) animals are easier, whereas objects can be tougher to precisely nail down at higher velocities. Mind you, distance also matters like it does with any action photography, so the same rules generally apply here, too. In low-light conditions, including indoors, you have to watch out for ramped-up ISO to offset the higher shutter speed, which could lead to a noisier result. I focused more on still photography, but also tried out video. For whatever reason, Nothing doesn’t enable using the same LUTs and presets to capture footage. Select a preset, and it reverts right back to Photo mode. Otherwise, you can record in 4K or Full HD resolution at 30p or 60p frame rates. The only other video modes are Slo-Mo and Time-lapse. Video quality is quite good in ideal settings, and with HDR mode, you have the option to record in H.265 for extra control in post-production, if desired. The Nothing Phone 3 is in an interesting spot. The brand doesn’t have the kind of imaging partnerships Chinese brands have, nor is it a household name in North America like the Big 3. NothingOS is one of the best Android overlays I’ve seen for the simple fact it strongly resembles stock Android. The build quality and hardware are solid, and battery life is excellent, so this phone ticks off a lot of the right boxes. I can understand how some might view the cameras as a drag on the overall package, especially given the competition at similar prices. But for an upstart brand trying its hand at a flagship, this is a very good debut. I tested the Nothing Phone 3 at the same time as the Vivo X200 FE, and the latter proved to be a more capable shooter in varying circumstances. On the flip side, NothingOS is a pleasure compared to Funtouch OS. The OnePlus 13R is closer in both price and performance in that it lacks Hasselblad’s input, and is a worthy option given how good OxygenOS is as an Android overlay. The Xiaomi 15 may cost a bit more but it retains many of the imaging trappings of the Ultra model. The upcoming Xiaomi 15T Pro (or something similar) may also be in the same wheelhouse. The Honor 400 is compelling as a cheaper option — except if you want a telephoto lens, get the Pro version. Maybe. NothingOS is a draw for sure because software is so vitally important to our daily interactions with phones. It’s not clear how much Nothing will try to fix on the camera side through further updates but if you like something fun and quirky, the Phone 3 is it.
