Filed under: Whether you’ve been invited to a dinner party or to stay the week at a Joshua Tree compound, your host deserves a token of appreciation — and here are 39 impeccable ideas If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. Dear guest of someone else’s home: I hope you didn’t show up empty-handed. Bringing a host or hostess gift isn’t just chic; it’s good manners! Now, different situations (and different hosts or hostesses) call for different gifts, from earnest to cheeky, casual to Very Special. A three-day weekend at someone’s recently renovated Joshua Tree compound merits something a little more premeditated than a $20 bottle of wine; for an intimate evening of takeout, couch rotting, and watching The Rehearsal finale, perhaps a box of Japanese incense matches will do the trick. Here’s the thing: Everyone wants to go to a party — well, maybe not those Gen Z professional bed-rotters on TikToks who just want to remain horizontal and scroll, but most of us — yet being a host can be burdensome. I speak from experience as someone who throws at least two relatively decadent gatherings a year; it’s expensive and exhausting, although I’d argue that it’s (almost) always worth it, even if a recycled glass Champagne flute or a stolen pint glass from The Commodore inevitably gets shattered on the floor every time… simply a sacrifice to the party gods. If you’ve been invited to a party, detach your eyeballs from the infinite scroll and go make some memories! Don’t just huff and puff about being late, missing all the mini lobster rolls, or having to stay longer than you’d like to avoid an exorbitant Uber fee; devote a little thought to how your lovely friend or family member put in an undoubtedly Herculean amount of effort (and likely quite a bit of money) to ensure that you, fabulous guest, have a damn good time or else. They built a dirty martini fountain; they made cucumber tea sandwiches; they wiped countertops and bought extra seltzer, all in the name of your amusement and pleasure. Maybe this person isn’t just hosting you in their home for a few hours, but as an overnight guest for a night or three (or longer — maybe you’re staying with someone for two months while your divorce proceedings get sorted, for instance). In these contexts, when you might unwind on their premises, disrupt their daily routine, and stroll their grounds (even if their “grounds” are just 400 square feet in Greenpoint), please take a minute to recognize: wow, what a lovely experience this friend has offered you! You not only evaded the gazillion dollars spent on a hotel or Airbnb, but you probably drank all of their fourth-wave coffee and used all their two-ply toilet paper. You’re enjoying their hospitality, and you should show some appreciation. What makes a great host or hostess gift? Something that feels a little luxe, but not enough to embarrass the recipient; think a lovely little indulgence that you feel like you’d need an excuse to buy for yourself. Price doesn’t always dictate value — such an object can be acquired for less than 10 bucks. It’s the thought that counts, and you want to be clever. It’s no secret that candles make great gifts. They smell good; they establish an elevated ambiance, like you’re in a luxury hotel lobby; and they let you build a very tiny little fire in your home. Fun! But as with any heavily fragranced product, tastes diverge and preferences differ as to what smells “great.” One relatively safe bet: the scent of hinoki, a Japanese cypress tree with a sophisticated, woody, calming aroma. While many hinoki-scented candles are out there, I’m personally a fan of Boy Smells’ Hinoki Fantôme. It’s a very sexy gender-agnostic scent that’s both mysterious and inviting, with notes of cardamom, pear, and oakmoss, like a quiet walk through a forest. Prices taken at time of publishing. While there’s a case to be made that cheap olives make the best dirty martinis, they do not make the best gifts. A $30 jar of Williams Sonoma olives may read “I stay at the Four Seasons,” but in terms of flavor and snackability, I’m partial to Filthy’s olives, these ones stuffed with creamy blue cheese. (FWIW, my friend bartends at an excellent cocktail bar in Hollywood and he says the brand’s brine makes the perfect dirty martinis.) Prices taken at time of publishing. Speaking of small, round things that are intended to be the finishing touch on a cocktail but which you will want to eat straight out of the jar, one absolutely must mention Luxardo cherries. You’ve probably seen them on the shelves of high-end cocktail bars, but if you’re unfamiliar, these are not just any old maraschino cherries, like the bright red ones that came in your childhood Shirley Temples; they’re made with marasca cherries and possess a romantic, sophisticated, almost marzipan-like flavor and a superior texture, and come swimming in a syrup made only of cherry juice and sugar — no weird chemicals or artificial colors. Luxardo is an Italian-run family company that’s been in business since 1821, and it takes its cherry products very seriously, specializing exclusively in maraschino liqueur and these fabulous cherries. Plus, the label is gorgeous. Prices taken at time of publishing. My uncle, who is an architect with excellent taste in restaurants and can quote every single film ever shown on Turner Classic Movies, turned me onto these when I was in my 20s, when I watched him frantically search for them at multiple gourmet food stores in Manhattan as he verbally emphasized that they are the only cocktail cherries that matter. In fact, while we’re on the topic of bettering a home bartending experience, I’d like to revive appreciation for the embroidered cocktail napkin — a staple of Mad Men times that has been unfortunately subjugated in popularity by stupid millennial graphic coasters. May I never receive a chevron-patterned foam coaster again, and let’s imagine the joy one would experience to instead be handed, along with their spritz, a soft linen napkin embroidered with an elegant crane or pelican. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you’re into thrifting, the designs of cocktail napkins from the 50s and 60s suggest that maybe people really were partying harder back then. Cocktail picks are the perfect gift for toting to a party, since they easily fit in a pocket or purse and can immediately be enjoyed with a garnished drink or to pick up and bite into one of those blue-cheese-stuffed olives. I love all of Joanna Buchanan’s cocktail picks (this $200 zodiac set is to die for, truly, though certainly not cheap), but to get out of dream world and back into reality, this $25 stainless steel set from West Elm is surprisingly sexy. Prices taken at time of publishing. Practical and wholesome, a great mug will become a kitchen-cabinet staple. When I remodeled my kitchen a few years back, my contractor gave me a Williams Sonoma mug with my initials on it as a gift once the project was completed. I now use it all the time, and when I do, I think of him and his thoughtfulness while I drink my milky Scottish breakfast tea. Of course, the number of great mugs out there is infinite, making it hard to decide which one your host deserves. For no particular reason at all other than it’s very cute and it’s big — and I love a big, cute mug — I’m infatuated with this Nicholas Mosse sheep mug from store-full-of-adorable-things The Six Bells. It kind of reminds me of that sheep sweater that Princess Diana infamously wore, is hand-painted in Ireland, and its price is in that perfect sweet spot under $50. Prices taken at time of publishing. Similar sentiment, slightly edgier feel: a cool ashtray remains highly useful for non-smokers, too, serving as a home for keys, matchbooks, or those really good sesame cashews from Trader Joe’s. In fact, bring a bag of your favorite nut mix when you present this bad boy. Prices taken at time of publishing. We caught a tip recently that chefs are going wild for Naomi, a new brand of high-end hand wash that is specifically formulated to help eliminate cooking odors. (As garlic-lovers, this promise definitely appeals.) Our shopping team recently took the bergamot- and black-pepper-scented After-Cooking Hand Scrub for a spin and it’s absolutely phenomenal, getting the job done in spades and leaving behind an appealing fragrance on par with the historical king of status hand soaps, Aesop. Plus, love the Yves Klein blue packaging. Prices taken at time of publishing. One of the problems with gifting a bottle of wine is that as soon as it’s opened, it needs to be consumed within a few days, and therefore will quickly be forgotten. But if you hand someone a bottle of flashy olive oil, it will live on their counter or in their pantry for months, reminding them over and over again of your considerate gesture and your good taste. Flamingo Estate, home to many gifts that are so nice you could confidently give them to Gwyneth Paltrow herself, makes our current favorite fancy-schmancy olive oil, announcing on the bottle itself that it’s produced with olives from 150-year-old trees. This is the kind of stuff that rich housewives in the Silverlake hills try to manifest in yoga class. Prices taken at time of publishing. While I haven’t tried it myself, I’ve also symbolically (and aesthetically — look at that tin) taken to this beautiful Palestinian-made olive oil, Ya Albi, after recently editing a piece about the region’s new generation of olive oil makers. Prices taken at time of publishing. Yes, we are currently in a renaissance of incredible glassware; I doubt that I need to tell you that, or to remind you that everyone could use another set of nice glasses to bring out when they have company. Last Christmas, I got my sister this set of geometric stemless cocktail glasses by the glass wizard Sophie Lou Jacobsen. They’re unfortunately sold out now, but in the same spirit, these Anthropologie stemless martini glasses are very similar and reasonably priced, and I’m also blown away by these Serax glasses with a rounded, bubbly foot. Prices taken at time of publishing. As far as wine glasses go, the Eater staff is currently obsessed with short, chonky glasses — they feel more comfortable to wave around while you tell a fascinating story, compared to the nerve-wracking thin-stemmed ones. I’d much rather sip out of one of these Gianfranco Frattini glasses than one that feels like I could shatter it with a quick squeeze. Prices taken at time of publishing. No need to buy a whole set — it’s a little oppressive to give someone who’s not a family member or romantic partner something that takes up a lot of cabinet space. Two will do! Three is awkward and four is too many. If you choose it wisely, gifting a coffee table book makes you look so artistically astute that it will reinforce that you’re a fascinating person who deserves to be invited to future dinner parties. Anything from TASCHEN is a pretty safe bet (see: this book about menu design in America), but for a little more humor and cross-cultural appeal, A24’s 2024 cookbook-coffee-table-book Scrounging is a collection of recipes from cult-fave films — some more useful than others— that promises to spark intrigue and conversation, from Phantom Thread’s omelet to Napoleon Dynamite’s nachos. Prices taken at time of publishing. You could also get them a proper cookbook from which they will actually want to cook. Fair enough! In that instance, I’d recommend perusing our guide to the best cookbooks of spring 2025 and picking the most fitting option for your friend. If you are my friend, please get me Salt Sugar MSG. I was over at a fellow food writer’s house about six months ago and he made me try one of these. It was one of those things where he said, “You’ve got to taste these peppercorns. They are way different from any pepper you’ve ever had, I promise,” and frankly, I took one out of sheer politeness but didn’t believe his claims. That is, until I tasted one of these crunchy little guys for myself; I can confirm that honestly, they’re downright psychedelic in their depth of flavor and unique aroma. What makes The Reluctant Trading Experiment’s Tellicherry peppercorns so mind-blowing? Sourced from India and mainly sourced to high-end restaurants, they’re somehow intoxicating and dimensional, extra-hot and extra-peppery, yet citrusy and floral and shockingly complex. A grinder full of them would be a culinary gift from the heavens. Prices taken at time of publishing. I mean… just look at it. A real conversation piece. The tomato one is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Not all of us live within close proximity of a proper Jewish deli that can offer a revelatory doughy, cinnamony babka experience. Who wouldn’t (besides the gluten-free among us) be delighted to receive a sweet, decadent duo of babkas — one classic, one chocolaty — from famed New York deli Russ & Daughters? Prices taken at time of publishing. Pro tip: Order this gift set from Goldbelly ahead of time and schedule the delivery date to align with your arrival or the day of the party. That way you can not only arrive hands-free, but hopefully be offered a slice yourself. Two birds, one stone. In the great tradition of things we all want to have around but are sometimes too cheap to buy for ourselves, let us consider fancy salt. A box (or bucket) of Maldon is always appreciated, of course, but showing up with Jacobsen Salt’s aesthetic, transportable set of infused salts just feels a little more gift-y. Prices taken at time of publishing. Our editorial director Lesley Suter makes a strong case that serving spoons are the ultimate host gift, and it just makes you think: When you set down a beautifully assembled Caprese salad or tray of tater tot casserole, isn’t it nice to have some diva’d out utensils with which to serve it? Her picks in this persuasive piece are all top-tier, but right now I’m really into the short-handled (or even handle-free) claw-like ones, like this wood set from Williams Sonoma or the kind-of-nutso stoneware set below that’s probably quite heavy but sure looks swish. Still, they’re easier to maneuver than two long-handled spoons and a bit easier to store, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. If your event is, like, tomorrow, this surprisingly attractive set of salad tongs is available in three colors, can be overnighted via Amazon, and is expensive-looking given its attainable $30 price tag. Prices taken at time of publishing. It’s unrealistic to buy a host or hostess an entire cookware set, no matter how fabulous their party or home is. But you know what makes a surprisingly clever gift? A small skillet for when you’re in the mood for a cheeky fried egg or two, or you want to quickly put together a little Béarnaise sauce for your steak. We’re partial — naturally — to the one from our collab with Heritage Steel. It’s American-made with 5-ply stainless steel and is easy to clean and care for. Sometimes littler is better! Prices taken at time of publishing. You know when you take a stick of butter out of the fridge, hoping to spread it all over your beautiful slice of Out of Thin Air sesame gochujang sourdough, and instead it’s hard and it’s going to tear up the surface of your bread and you’re SAD? No longer a problem once you get your hands on one of these cleverly designed butter spreader knives, which you can glide over the top of your butter hunk to achieve a spreadable consistency instantly. Prices taken at time of publishing. Sure, it’s a bit of a stocking-stuffer type gadget, but it’s currently June, and we still think everyone should have one. Design-forward butter dishes are also having a major moment right now — more on that here. Cutting boards are, again, one of those things you could always use more of, especially from a chef-fave brand like Boos. We’ve gone on and on about how Boos blocks are the Bentleys of cutting boards, thanks to their high-quality wood and durable construction. Prices taken at time of publishing. Don’t ask me how I stumbled across this discovery, because it’s a very long and convoluted story, but it has come to my attention that the French designer Christian Lacroix — in addition to producing beautiful and theatrical clothing — has also made some really exquisite tableware and, more specifically, plates. Prices vary wildly on secondhand sites such as eBay, but if you look strategically, you can get a trompe l’oeil plate with his signature embellished cross on it for under $50 — with the original box, might I add. The butterfly collection is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Matches come in handy for many reasons; lighting candles, of course; sparking up a slim, cheeky joint; or keeping in your bathroom for houseguests in search of discretion about their activities. Yes, you could grab a matchbox for free at your favorite dive bar, but having a box of illustrated Diptyque matches sitting next to your soap dish is just a quiet flex. I was devastated to find out that all of Diptyque’s scented matches are currently sold out, but thankfully, Hibi’s beloved Japanese incense matches are currently in stock a few different places online. An eight-pack (below) will probably do the trick for a casual dinner party gift, but a 30-pack will keep your host’s home in a state of zen for weeks or months. Prices taken at time of publishing. I also genuinely love the gold-foiled, retro-hippie-chic look of classic Incense Matches, and I find the paper incense from Optatum to be so stylish and decorous, it looks like it belongs next to the sink of a bathroom in Versailles. Prices taken at time of publishing. Diptyque, while foolish not to immediately restock its scented matches, also makes a basil-scented odor-removing candle. Yes, it is $75, but according to the brand, it’s “based on a technology that targets and eliminates the molecules responsible for unpleasant odors. It replaces them with green and aromatic combinations of basil, mint, and tomato leaf.” There’s a somewhat convincing case here that it could quickly become a high-end kitchen essential. Prices taken at time of publishing. Eater has accurately referred to Levain as New York City’s most popular bakery, although it now has locations in multiple cities, all of which are very busy. I’m going to be totally honest with you: I do not love the cookies from Levain. I’m a flat, chewy, doughy cookie girl and I don’t like nuts in my cookies, and Levain’s cookies are tall, thick, gooey, and very nut-positive. But I can tell you this with confidence: People go absolutely feral for these cookies. The bakery’s closest location to me, in LA’s Larchmont neighborhood, is inundated with cookie-seekers at all hours of the day, with lines snaking down the block. I seem to be the only person in the world that simply doesn’t vibe that hard with Levain’s cookie style, so I can still advise that they will make a well-loved, quickly devoured gift. And honestly, this photo is borderline pornographic and makes me “get it.” Prices taken at time of publishing. Perhaps thanks to the modern ubiquity of the Aperol spritz, aperitifs and digestifs have never been more on-the-radar for the home-bar-cart crowd. As a Bay Area native, I came of indie-sleaze age drinking a lot of Fernet-Branca, the face-contorting bitter of choice for San Francisco bartenders. But, thanks to their sweetness, amaros are a little more user-friendly and giftable, and many of them feature beautiful bottles and offer an air like you went and fetched them directly from Italy. While there are dozens, if not hundreds, of superb amaros out there — I love the smoky honey flavor of Amaro Dell’Erborista and the fanciful bottle design of Amaro Nonino — I’d argue that the best bang for your buck is Amaro Meletti. Butterscotchy and cola-like (but not cloying) with notes of chocolate, anise, and saffron, it’s well-balanced, cheerful, and equally enjoyable neat, on the rocks, or with seltzer. It doesn’t hurt that at $26, its price is incredibly reasonable. Prices taken at time of publishing. Step it up by bringing a bottle of really good tequila. Eater’s guide to the best tequila is comprehensive and might just leave you even less decisive, since they all sound amazing, so I’ll narrow it down to two options for you. If you’re looking to spend less than $100, go with Siembra Valles reposado. “But I don’t like reposado,” you might say, traumatized by long, barely recallable nights with Mr. Cuervo in college. Fear not — this is a totally different experience. Made by maestro tequilero Don Salvador Rosales Briseño, this tequila has an almost vanilla-like flavor, and is aged in proprietary Missouri white oak barrels. It’s also paler than many reposado tequilas you’ll see on shelves, because it’s only aged for three months, giving it a more blanco-like taste with hints of mint and citrus fruit. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you are blessed with ample expendable income and/or are hoping to impress the unimpressible, show up with a bottle of Rey Sol Extra Añejo. It’s lauded as one of the finest tequilas available — for real! — falling into a special category reserved for those spirits aged a minimum of five years in carefully constructed oak barrels. Its aroma is known for offering rich notes of vanilla, caramel, and wood, and is on par with the most storied, world-famous whiskies in terms of quality and smoothness. Plus, that bottle — you’ll definitely want to keep it long after you’ve taken the last sip. Prices taken at time of publishing. You can trust me, wholeheartedly, on all of the ideas above, and I’ll trust that you won’t break another one of my Champagne glasses.

Title: Waymo To Separate From Google?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 11: A Waymo autonomous vehicle drives along Masonic Avenue on ... More April 11, 2022 in San Francisco, California. San Francisco is serving as testing grounds for autonomous vehicles with Waymo, a Google subsidiary and Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, logging millions of test miles throughout San Francisco in 2021. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Alphabet’s self-driving business, Waymo, has built up considerable momentum over the last few years. The company recently said that it was delivering about 250,000 autonomous rides per week, up from less than 10,000 rides per week less than two years ago. Unlike many robo-taxi upstarts that have faded or shifted focus, Waymo is actually scaling. With the company set to scale up operations in multiple new cities and mainstream acceptance of robotaxis picking up, Waymo might be on its way to becoming a key contender in shaping the future of urban transportation. That said, there are risks due to the startup’s uncertain unit economics and the ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. Waymo is losing money - a lot of money. Waymo’s cash burn makes any forced separation of Waymo from Google - a question of Waymo’s survival. As such, we look into the cash burn first. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? Now, almost seven years since its launch, Waymo remains unprofitable. While Google does not break down Waymo’s financials, its Other Bets segment, which includes the robotaxi startup, posted a $4.4 billion loss over the last fiscal year. The cost base is high. Waymo owns the vehicles it operates, a contrast to ride hailing players such as Uber. Then, there are the costs tied to vehicle retrofitting, mapping, and fleet management. This means that Waymo has yet to demonstrate a path to profitability, even at the relatively large scale it is currently operating at. Waymo still loses money on every ride it delivers. This has meant that Waymo is burning through cash and remains dependent on external funding. Check out how Alphabet’s Operating Cash Flows compare to peers. Waymo has raised over $10 billion in the unit since its inception, with its most recent $5.6 billion Series C coming last year, led by Alphabet, along with marquee investors such as a16z, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. As Waymo’s growth accelerates, a new challenge could be looming in the form of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, which might result in the DOJ ordering a breakup of Alphabet’s sprawling portfolio. Granted, the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit primarily targets Google’s dominant position in the search and advertising space. But on a core level, the department might be focusing on how Alphabet’s current organizational structure helps it cement its overall dominance. See how Google’s Revenues have been trending. That puts units like Waymo directly in regulators’ sights, given that it is a loss-making business that benefits from Google’s capital, shared intelligence and analytics, and Google’s deep trove of data. There are ways that Waymo drives Google’s long-term strategy as well - think real data collection, AI advancement. The money-losing rides might also be seen as costly R&D spending that generates valuable real-world data. This is why Google continues to fund the company despite mixed economics. Waymo depends on Alphabet not just for funding but for technical resources, cloud computing, AI talent, and mapping data. Without Alphabet’s backing and ecosystem support, Waymo could face pressure to cut costs. The timing couldn’t be worse. EV and self-driving behemoth Tesla is set to ramp up deployments of its own robo-taxis shortly. Tesla has a massive installed base of vehicles on the road already, and it plans to allow owners of full-self-driving (FSD) Teslas to rent out their vehicles, when they aren’t being used, to its robo-taxi fleet. See - Buy or Sell Tesla stock. This could translate into better unit economics versus Waymo. If Waymo is forced to separate from Google as its business continues to gain commercial traction, it risks losing out on its hard-won lead. Alphabet stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, due to concerns about the economy, doubts about the growth of the company’s search business in the AI era, and the ongoing antitrust issues. See how Alphabet's valuation ratios compare against historical levels and also versus peers.

Title: Your best bet for finding a new job could be looking at your old one

Welcome back! The start of another week could mean a scramble to figure out what you're eating every night. A registered dietitian suggests these 15 items at Costco that can be healthy, quick dinners and satisfying snacks. In today's big story, the best bet for job seekers might be returning to a familiar place. What's on deck Markets: The top hangout spots for Wall Street's incoming interns. (You decide whether you want to visit or avoid them.) Tech: New data shows how quickly chatbots are scooping up human jobs. Business: Some franchisees for Floyd Mayweather's fitness business are taking legal action against the legendary boxer and the company. But first, what's old is new again. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The future of the job market might be about looking in the past. Job seekers and their former companies are finding comfort in reconnecting as both sides navigate a challenging job market, writes BI's Madison Hoff. ADP payroll data for March indicated that the share of boomerang hires increased since the same time last year. It's no surprise that workers and their old bosses are teaming back up. The economic uncertainty has everyone on edge, and dealing in known quantities offers some relief. For job seekers, returning to a previous employer could mean stability and security that you might not typically find at a new job. Meanwhile, employers are being cautious about making new hires. They want to be certain about the ones they do bring on. A former worker whose capabilities are already known could ease those concerns. Not everyone will be welcomed back to their old stomping grounds. When workers held all the power in 2021, some made rash decisions as they headed for the exits, which could come back to bite them. They "rage quit," or used a red-hot job market to create bidding wars for themselves. The ones who stuck around sometimes took it easy, avoiding the #hustleharder culture for a new trend: quiet quitting. Even if you think you're in good standing with your old bosses, you might be wrong. BI previously reported how tech companies like Meta and Microsoft have "block" lists of ex-employees they won't rehire. Things could also be a lot different than what you remember. At one point, companies were happy to hand out flashy titles and quick promotions to keep workers happy. Efficiency and frugality are now all the rage, and the status an ex-employee once held might not remain. Like an eldest child returning from college only to find their younger sibling has taken over their room, the times have changed. 1. Oasis Management founder's jet-setting month. Seth Fischer spoke at three different Sohn conferences across the globe in May. He's passionate about the Sohn Foundation, which focuses on childhood cancer research and prevention, and is named after his former colleague, who died from the disease at age 29. 2. Wall Street's "uber-bear" warns about potential stock declines. Albert Edwards, who shot to fame for predicting the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, told BI that stocks are still vulnerable. In his opinion, the top risk the market should be wary of is rising Japanese interest rates. 3. Where Wall Street's summer interns hang out. Hundreds of college students will soon descend upon New York City as they start their summer programs on Wall Street. Industry insiders spoke with BI about the top spots interns frequent when they're not pulling all-nighters. 1. AI is already taking human jobs. Companies are hiring fewer people in roles that AI can do, according to data from Revelio Labs. Not all jobs are disappearing at the same rate — those with more AI-doable tasks are vanishing faster, which is bad news for people in tech. 2. Southeast Asia's tech startups are chasing the American dream. Traditionally, startups from the region focused on local markets, but AI is piquing their interest in building for the US. Plus, having American customers is good for fundraising. 3. How the robots get made. Amazon is spending big on robots and automation for its fulfillment centers. BI got an inside look at how the robots are made and trained in facilities outside Boston. It's a glimpse into the new US manufacturing. 1. A legendary boxer's fitness business is struggling, and everyone is pointing fingers. At its peak in 2023, Floyd Mayweather's Mayweather Boxing and Fitness had 70 locations. Dozens have closed. The boxer's attorney pointed to wider industry challenges, like a slowdown among boutique gyms. Some franchisees say Mayweather could have done more to support the business. 2. Bride or die. Bachelorette parties aren't just about ibuprofen and bikinis. Nowadays, women book dayslong vacations that include merch and decor to prove their love to the bride. These trips are often just as anticipated — and can even be as expensive — as the big day, bolstering a whole new subset of the economy. 3. Don't blame DOGE. Elon Musk said DOGE was treated unfairly by its critics, and became the "whipping boy for everything," in an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday. Though he's leaving his role as a government employee, Musk said he'll continue to work on DOGE, albeit on a part-time basis. Campbell's reports earnings.

Brands that cater to the uber wealthy saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. Crystal Kim Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Everything is not so “gucci” in the world of luxury goods. Brands that cater to the uber-wealthy, including LVMH’s Christian Dior, Kering’s Gucci, and Chanel, saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. While CEOs of luxury goods retailers are chalking up the challenging environment to macroeconomic turbulence, market analysis suggests the industry’s excesses of the past few years could be contributing to weakness. While luxury goods companies have largely been immune to the state of economies, the decline that started last year could accelerate into 2025, Morgan Stanley analysts Eduoard Aubin and Arunima Sinha said last week during a state-of-the-market discussion at the firm’s luxury conference in Paris. Chinese nationals and Americans, the two cohorts expected to drive more than 50% of total spending in the next three to five years, are traveling less. Fewer Americans are heading to Europe, and fewer Chinese people are flying to Japan, which could translate to weaker sales in the second quarter than in the first, according to the analysts. Waning business optimism about China and weakness in US consumer spending also do not bode well for the industry. Chanel, which usually raises prices a couple of times a year, is in wait-and-see mode on potential hikes, global CFO Philippe Blondiaux said in a recent interview with Vogue Business. Some luxury retailers are chugging along, with Hermès and Cartier parent Richemont reporting sales growth in the first quarter of 2025 from the year prior. The price of the smallest Birkin bag rose to $12,700 in May, per Sotheby’s. Luxury brand companies’ best years coincided with the largest increases in US households’ net worth. Profits nearly tripled between 2019 and 2024, with the four biggest luxury companies — LVMH, Hermès, Richemont, and Kering — taking the lion’s share, per a McKinsey report published in January. Price hikes, some of which were as high as 100% on certain goods, accounted for approximately 80% of industry growth during that period, the report stated. Demand for leather handbags, branded jewelry, and watches reached a fever pitch as US households’ net worth rose by $51 trillion between 2020 and 2024. Much of that went to the top 20%, or households earning more than $160,000, which were supported by a rise in financial wealth (Read: stock markets going up): Yes for Less: Recruiting might be difficult. Value-conscious shoppers’ behavior lately shows regular folks are prioritizing function over fashion. James Conroy, chief of Ross Stores, said in an earnings call in May: “In terms of customer behavior, perhaps you could say there’s a little bit of a shift towards more functional items versus discretionary items.” Snacks now make up around half of the historic soup company’s sales, up from less than a third a decade ago. 2025 is projected to be an unusually terrible year for the US travel industry — and only the US travel industry. At less than three years old and with just ten products, Rhode is a rocket ship with $212 million in net sales last year. The Fed was already walking a tightrope over a bottomless pit of stagflation before waves of tariffs came to rattle the line. You can’t bounce back without first getting low. And, in April, consumer confidence according to the Conference Board got real low. While the company didn’t mention the threat of tariffs, Nike is heavily exposed in China, home to roughly 24% of its suppliers. After the auction, the yield on the 20-year note rose to 5.125%, the highest level since back in November 2023. Soft US inflation numbers released last week and a de-escalation of global trade tensions are likely contributing to bitcoin’s rebound. CATL — blacklisted by the US Department of Defense in January for alleged ties to the Chinese military — pulled off the best IPO of the year. Klarna’s 100 million-user win sounds nice, but its users are increasingly struggling with the “pay later” part of the arrangement. Travelers are expected to spend $12.5 billion less on trips to the US this year, while the rest of the world is about to see a tourism boost. US cattle inventories have been battered by drought, leading to record beef prices and a long road to bringing them down. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Famed market bear Albert Edwards tells BI stocks are vulnerable — and opens up about his role as Wall Street's 'uber-bear'

Even if the words coming out of Albert Edwards' mouth were gloomy, the famously bearish Société Générale strategist was in his usual good mood on Tuesday. It's something that tends to catch people off guard when they meet him, he said. "I'm quite a happy, upbeat person," Edwards told BI. "As opposed to the miserable bastard I come across in my written work." If you follow the British strategist's research, it's not hard to see why he comes across as a grouch. He is known as a perennial bear on Wall Street (he refuses the moniker of "perma-bear" and prefers "uber-bear"). His weekly client notes regularly question the prevailing market narrative and warn of downside scenarios. His latest report warned that rising Japanese bond yields could lead to a "global financial market Armageddon." His tune during a May 27 interview was no different. Edwards, who shot to fame for correctly calling the eventual dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said that stocks are still vulnerable to a pullback after their 18% rally from April lows. Despite investors starting to discount recession and inflation risks on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff reductions, valuations remain high and risks abound, he said. One of those risks is the possibility that investors start to question hefty AI spending from the mega-cap tech firms. Another is a potential recession. But, in his opinion, the top risk the market should be aware of is rising Japanese interest rates, which could cause an exodus of capital from the US as investors unwind the yen carry trade and chase more attractive yields. The Bank of Japan, having kept interest rates low for years, pushed flows of money into US stocks and bonds. Now that the trend is reversing, those flows could grind to a halt, he said. Ultimately, however, it's not easy to know what will spark a stock-market decline. What's easier to know is simply that the market is in a precarious spot thanks to "steamy" valuations. One popular measure, the Shiller CAPE ratio, shows stock valuations at some of their highest levels in history. "These are really super high valuations," he said. "And you look at things like the relationship between bonds and equities, with bond yields where they are now and the equity risk premium being so low." "You just think, 'You're a bit vulnerable here to bad news, aren't you?'" he added. "Something comes along, you really are not in a great situation." Edwards is something of an anomaly on Wall Street. Most of the time, top strategists issue fairly bullish forecasts. For example, in January this year, the average 2025 S&P 500 price target saw 11.5% upside. Just two strategists — Stifel's Barry Bannister and BCA Research's Peter Berezin — predicted negative returns this year. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case, but suffice to say, investors were caught off guard by the S&P 500's 20% decline from February to April. It's these rapid declines, though few and far between, that Edwards wants investors to keep in mind as possible outcomes in frothy environments. As a result of pessimistic tendencies, Edwards isn't correct all too often, but that's not necessarily the point — and his readers know that. "A lot of clients who totally disagree with me like to read my stuff. It's a reality check," he said. Earlier this year, financial professionals detailed to BI the pressure that strategists face from both their bosses and clients if they're wrongly bearish for too long. David Rosenberg, who called the housing bubble and recession in the mid-to-late 2000s while working as the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm asked him not to use the word "bubble" to describe housing market dynamics at the time because it was scaring clients. Edwards said he doesn't feel that pressure. He writes his notes as Société Générale's "alternative view," separate from their house view. "You have to have good employers," he said. "People have said to me, 'If you worked at an American bank, you'd be fired immediately because of your views.'" Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.
