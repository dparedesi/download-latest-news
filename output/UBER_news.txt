ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price. His portfolio also includes “Magnificent Seven” stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater’s assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman’s ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company’s shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm’s principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw’s flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments. Tudor Investment Corp., which manages $17 billion in assets, gained a modest 6.5% last year, and its macro-focused founder is cautioning investors about what he views as an overheated stock market and the underlying dangers of artificial intelligence. In an op-ed he wrote for Time in June, Jones cited the rising unemployment rate for recent college graduates and said, “As someone who has spent nearly half a century as a professional risk manager, every alarm bell in my being is ringing.” Two Sigma’s two founders have a strained relationship that boiled into the open when a 2023 SEC filing disclosed that they were “unable to reach agreement on a number of topics.” But the quant hedge fund is still a powerhouse with $60 billion in assets under management. Overdeck and Siegel stepped back from their co-CEO roles last year to become co-chairmen of the firm, but Overdeck returned to its management committee earlier this year.

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher as markets kicked off a new trading week. Inflation is likely to remain in focus as investors look toward Thursday's release of the latest Consumer Price Index data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% to a record closing high, and the Dow ended 0.3% higher. Shares of video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) surged 3.8% to reach an all-time high and secure the top daily performance in the S&P 500 after the company launched its latest professional basketball game and announced plans to develop a college basketball game. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares drove 3.7% higher after it announced plans with self-driving technology firm Momenta to begin testing autonomous vehicles in Munich, Germany, in 2026. The company also moved to sell $2.25 billion in investment-grade bonds, Bloomberg reported, with the proceeds directed toward general corporate purposes. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) added 3.2%, extending strong gains late last week after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings. A surge in artificial intelligence revenue underpinned the strong performance, and Broadcom said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new client, which reports said could be OpenAI. CVS Health (CVS) shares dropped 4.8%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, after top executives at a Morgan Stanley investor conference did not offer new financial forecasts or updates on the federal government's impending release of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans, which could have a significant impact on revenue CVS derives from plans operated through its Aetna insurance business. One of the executives speaking at the conference reportedly stressed CVS has a policy of not updating its guidance between quarterly earnings releases. Shares of alcoholic beverage maker Brown-Forman (BF.B) fell 4.6%. The stock has been trending downward since the Jack Daniel's parent last month posted a lower-than-expected profit. The company noted a negative impact from the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The company said it also faces headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the potential for price pressure related to oversupply in the American whiskey market. Including Monday's decline, Brown-Forman shares have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) announced a plan to offer around $3.25 billion in senior and exchangeable notes, as well as launch a registered direct offering of ordinary shares. The former adds to the company's debt levels, while the latter dilutes the ownership stake of existing stockholders. Shares of the cruise operator sank 4.4% on Monday.

Title: These 200+ Alexa Commands Took My Echo Devices to the Next Level

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies. Robinhood’s inclusion validates a maturing, retail-first fintech that happens to have crypto in its product mix; it pulls another crypto-adjacent revenue stream directly into America’s most-tracked benchmark without making a call on any single token. By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.
