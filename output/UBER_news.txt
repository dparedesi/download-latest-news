ByPeter Lane Taylor ByPeter Lane Taylor, Contributor. By dollar value, it’s been a big month for Florida luxury real estate. Last week, a 15-acre Naples waterfront estate closed for a whopping $225 million, the second highest home sale price in U.S. history and a new state record, dwarfing the $173 million Oracle’s Larry Ellison paid for his Manalapan estate south of Palm Beach in 2022. According to news reports, activist investor David Hoffmann is also under contract on a separate Naples estate for an undisclosed sum north of $100 million. Across the Everglades on the other side of the state, high eight-figure deals are closing at an equivalent clip, including a La Gorce Island estate in Miami Beach which recently settled for $75 million. In total, sixteen homes priced at $40 million-plus have sold in Florida in the past six months. The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg just launched sales. The development is the fourth Waldorf Astoria Residences in the U.S. after Miami, Denver, and Pompano Beach The islands between downtown Miami and Miami Beach on Biscayne Bay, including Star Island in the foreground, feature some of the most expensive waterfront estates in America These are big numbers in short order even by Florida’s recent standards, particularly with the stock market whipsawing, the full measure of President Trump’s tariffs still unknown, and the risk of a wider economic downturn looking more plausible by the day. More broadly, the sales reaffirm several current trends. First, the asymmetry between the two ends of the housing market is widening further. On the mid to lower six-figure pitch where most Americans play, the majority of buyers are still spooked by punitive interest rates, stubborn inflation, and a legitimate unease about buying high. Not surprisingly, overall inventory is up, appreciation is decelerating, and sellers no longer have the stronger hand. The other end of the housing market is showing more verve and braggadocio: before COVID, multi-million dollar properties could sit for years. Today, in most markets, they are still trading briskly while largely resisting the headwinds depressing the rest of the industry. Affluent real estate markets with limited inventory like Aspen have experienced a noticeable increase in sales activity since the pandemic The growing asymmetry signals a hardening of a second trend originally triggered by the pandemic. With fiscal certainty still at a premium, wealthy buyers who can close all-cash deals are continuing to seek safe harbor in hard assets with limited supply: ergo, ultra-luxury real estate in NIMBY-enclaves where tight geography and even tighter zoning regulations keep inventory scarce and prices elevated. The S&P 500’s 77% bump since COVID also has roughly doubled the world’s eight and nine figure multi-millionaires. As a result, the overall demand for high-end residences in rarified communities with small airports and long runways, such as Aspen, Park City, Palo Alto, and Naples, looks to remain frothy for the foreseeable future. The third trend borne out of the past month’s lather is geographic. If anything were poised to suck the oxygen out of Florida’s luxury real estate boom since the pandemic, it still hasn’t happened yet. And the state’s financial center of gravity is finally, inevitably moving west. Billionaire's Row: The Central Park (l) and Steinway Towers (r) at sunset along 57th St. in Manhattan This is all welcome news for Ryan Shear, Managing Partner at Property Markets Group (PMG), a Miami-based real estate development firm founded by Kevin Maloney in 1991 that’s behind some of America’s most architecturally iconic — and exclusive — residential high rises, including 111 W. 57th St. on Manhattan’s ‘Billionaire’s Row’ (a.k.a. “the world's skinniest skyscraper”) which, at 1,428’, ranks as the second tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. This week, Shear and PMG’s other Managing Partner, Dan Kaplan, announced the launch of the firm’s newest precipitus opus: the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, a soaring 50-story tower that will be the Florida city’s tallest, priciest, and most palatial building once completed in 2030. For the storied hotel brand — originally founded in New York City in 1893 (now owned by Hilton) — the new development will be its fourth residential high rise in the U.S., following groundbreaking on the Waldorf Astoria Pompano Beach this month, the launch of Waldorf Astoria Denver Cherry Creek last year, and the Waldorf Astoria Miami which is currently under construction. For PMG, the project signifies an ever-deeper push into the luxury branded residence space and its biggest bet yet that the hyper-posh, super-amenitized, starchitect-designed high rise formula the company has mastered in Miami is just getting started on the other side of the state. Floor to ceiling windows frame endless Tampa Bay and Gulf views from every floor of the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Gourmet kitchens at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Priced out of Miami, many high net worth individuals are moving their money and Florida's real estate momentum to the state's Gulf Coast including cities like St. Petersburg and Naples The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg (pictured center) will transform the city's skyline and is anticipated to usher in a new wave of luxury development downtown In many respects, Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg is surfing a wave that’s been breaking for years. The branded residential real estate space has been on a tear since well before the pandemic, outpacing the wider housing market by almost every metric and fueling a free-for-all of new entrants and partnerships both in South Florida and around the world. The forces and factors driving the sector — 5-star service, brand loyalty, and higher re-sale value, among others — have been exhaustively covered in dozens of articles, mine included, so I don’t need to undress them further here. What’s noticeably different this time around, though, is the place on the Monopoly board Shear and PMG are putting new foundations in the ground. Historically most high-profile brands that have waded into the fray — among them early pioneers like Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons and, more recently, Nobu, Aston Martin, and Armani — have tended to cluster in glitzy, global metropolises where real estate values already are sky high and the world’s 1% like to throw their money around, such as Manhattan, Miami, and Dubai. They also tend to congregate in exclusive resort destinations in Los Cabos, the Yucatan, and the Caribbean. A dining room rendering at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Every residence at the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg has its own private foyer That makes the prospect of a Waldorf Astoria tower in downtown St. Petersburg an outlier on the trend line which, in turn, portends a potentially significant shift in how the luxury branded residence game is played. If Florida’s central Gulf Coast — traditionally a magnet for Midwestern retirees and spring break beach benders — is worthy of world-class architecture and a high-society brand like Waldorf Astoria, who’s to say Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs aren’t next? The reality is more complicated. Notwithstanding its fixed, physical form, real estate is innately fluid, albeit on a relatively more molten scale. Tastes change. Buildings decay. Neighborhoods evolve. Consequently, up-and-coming locations that simmered with possibility two decades ago might very well be tapped out today (think Fort Lauderdale). Similarly, cities and commercial corridors currently deemed ‘second tier’ or not befitting a Fendi, Cipriani, or comparably premium brand could be the next Nashville or Park Slope hiding in plain sight. St. Petersburg, Florida is often ranked one of America's best places to live and retire due to its affordability, safety, and healthy quality of life St. Petersburg Beach and Clearwater Beach are two of the state's most stunning stretches of Gulf Coast By this measure, St. Petersburg is definitely having its ‘moment’ — along with the rest of the greater Tampa Bay region for that matter. The drivers behind the boom are the usual Florida suspects: warm weather, low taxes, a healthy lifestyle, strong job growth, and a blossoming entrepreneurial scene thanks to a widespread in-migration of talent during the pandemic. Yet, what’s currently happening in St. Petersburg is also part of a longer-term demographic shift. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties on the state’s Atlantic Coast have finally begun to spill over, and savvy investors and wealthy buyers now priced out of traditionally tony waterfront enclaves like Bal Harbor, Surfside, Jupiter, and SoFi (‘South of Fifth’) in Miami Beach are taking their money — and Florida’s center of affluence — westward. “Florida’s Gulf coast is among the most under-valued real estate markets in the country,” Shear tells me, “Especially compared with cities like Miami and West Palm Beach. St. Pete is a hidden gem that’s been under the radar for a very long time and it’s just beginning to come into its own. The city is also becoming a magnet for high net-worth individuals thanks to its vibrant cultural scene, stunning waterfront, and exceptional quality of life.” Th architecturally iconic Salvador Dali Museum houses the largest collection of work by the famed artist outside of Europe An aerial perspective of St. Petersburg. Tropicana Field in the foreground is the home of MLB's Tampa Bay Rays For the locals and snowbirds who discovered St. Petersburg long before Wall Street and Big Tech did, none of the current praise-heaping comes as a surprise. The city often rates as one of America’s best places to live and retire on account of its affordability, walkability, beach access, up-and-coming culinary scene, and world-renowned art museums, galleries, and performance venues, including the Salvador Dalí Museum as well as the Chiluly Collection at the Morean Arts Center. Socially and economically, St. Pete is also safe and inclusive and boasts a diversified economy with industries like healthcare and technology playing a significant role in the city’s sustainable growth in addition to tourism. In a recent study by WalletHub ranking the “Best-& Worst-Run Cities in America”, St. Pete ranked #1 in Florida overall. Nationally, the city’s economy ranked second, ahead of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Austin (by comparison, Miami came in #62, Fort Lauderdale #121). St. Petersburg Pier is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions Old Southeast is one of St. Petersburg's most historic downtown neighborhoods Sunshine Skyway Bridge connects St. Petersburg to Tampa Bay “St. Pete has arrived,” says Larry Feldman, CEO of Feldman Equities which is co-developing the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg with PMG. “Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed the city’s incredible rise. And the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria brand is testament to this extensive growth and the natural progression St. Pete has undergone. We’re eager to deliver a branded residential development that meets the elevated caliber of living the city’s new residents desire, and I can’t wait to see all of the opportunities and incredible experiences this project will contribute to the downtown area.” The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg will add a striking new silhouette to the city's waterfront skyline Beach Drive in downtown St Petersburg is one of the city's primary thoroughfares On this last point, Feldman made me realize something else the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg says about the current state of the branded residential real estate space: that it’s actually quite symbiotic. For Feldman, Shear, PMG, and Waldorf Astoria, St. Pete offers a rare opportunity: a lead position in an A-series funding round if Facebook were luxury real estate. In return, St. Pete gains global credibility virtually overnight thanks to Waldorf’s ‘legitimatizing’ effect on the city’s stature and prestige, much the same way a James Beard Award-winning chef opening up a new restaurant in a neighborhood that’s revitalizing is usually a sure sign it’s “arrived” As a result, the value of Waldorf Astoria coming to St. Petersburg is far from simply architectural or temporarily economic in terms of job creation and investment. The original Waldorf hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan hosted diplomats and distinguished foreign visitors and catered to the needs of New York’s socially prominent, “upper crust". The Waldorf brand was also renowned for setting the original standards for luxury and indulgence in hospitality, including becoming the first hotel in the world to offer electricity and private bathrooms in every room. “A project of this scale and caliber with a globally revered 5-star brand like the Waldorf Astoria attached has a profound, legitimizing effect on a city like St. Petersburg,” explains Shear. “It serves as a powerful signal that the city is not just on the rise, but poised for its next chapter of growth and transformation. St. Pete is a major luxury market that deserves to carry on the Waldorf legacy, and this project will help the city gain global recognition, bring long-term development benefits, and I’m confident that other 5-star brands will follow suit.” Clearwater Beach Pier Kiteboarding on Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg captures the essence of the region's healthy, active, outdoor lifestyle The Museum of Fine Arts in downtown St. Petersburg is one of many nationally and world-renowned arts and cultural institutions in the city Another powerful side effect of a high-profile branded residential real estate project coming to a city like St. Petersburg is its ‘globalizing’ effect, especially when an internationally recognized brand like Waldorf Astoria is involved. Shear anticipates that at least 30% of his buyers will come from Europe and Latin America, most of whom will reside in St. Pete part of the year and all of whom regard their purchases as a long-term financial investment (the other 70% will come from the Midwest and Northeast). “We’re all selling sunshine and low taxes in Florida,” Shear says, “But along the West Coast in areas like Tampa and St. Petersburg specifically, premium real estate remains resilient, driven by sustained demand from both domestic and international high net-worth individuals who view the current market conditions as an opportunity to invest in tangible U.S. assets like real estate, which has long been a cornerstone of long-term wealth building. But unlike other investments, real estate offers the added benefit of personal enjoyment and use, delivering value beyond just financial returns especially when you consider that you’re living in a 5-star hotel.” The Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg will be the tallest building in the city once it's completed offering endless horizon views from every residence No luxury or amenity is spared at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, in keeping with the original legacy of the brand Custom made Italian vanities are one of many lavish fixtures and furnishings that are featured in the residences To merge Waldorf Astoria’s rich legacy with St. Pete’s unique history, character, and charm, PMG has tapped CUBE 3 for the tower architecture with interiors curated by the award-winning design firm BAMO. The high rise’s fully finished two- and three-bedroom residences will range from 2,031 square feet to 3,408 square feet and feature private foyers, custom closets, Italian vanities, chef’s kitchens, and expansive terraces with Tampa Bay views along with finishes, furnishings, and appliances befitting the Waldorf reputation for unparalleled décor and design. The tower’s top two-stories will be combined into the penthouse residence that will encompass 10,000 square feet overall with a private pool. On the amenities side, a 20,000-square-foot, resort-style pool deck will feature a 160-foot east pool with Bay views, a sunset pool with dual spas, elegant lounge areas, and a bar, while the Amenity Suite on Level 18 offers a thoughtfully curated wellness center prioritizing holistic healing and connection with nature. Spaces in the center will include private massage rooms, his and her saunas and steam rooms, as well as a state-of-the-art fitness center and movement studio. On Level 46, residents will have exclusive access to the legendary Peacock Alley-inspired Sky Lounge, a signature space that captures the legacy, elegance, and sophistication of the Waldorf Astoria brand. The end of another perfect day at St. Pete Beach As for the next evolution in the luxury branded residence space? Shear remains bullish on the niche market as well as the long-term drivers underpinning it. “We never really know until we launch a new project, but we feel strongly that there is real depth for branded real estate developments not just in cities like Miami, but in cities like St. Petersburg too,” he says. “All indications are that there continues to be strong demand not only for seasoned, well-capitalized developers who deliver on time, but also for 5-star brands like Waldorf Astoria that offer buyers peace of mind, an exceptional quality of life, and design, quality, and craftsmanship that are second to none.” If Shear’s instincts are right — which, based on PMG’s track record, they usually are — St. Petersburg and the wider Tampa Bay region, including Sarasota and Bradenton, are just getting started. Residences at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg start in the mid-$2m.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement From setting timers to controlling your smart home, here's how Amazon's voice assistant has evolved with new features to make your life easier this spring season. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has evolved far beyond a simple talking speaker. Like Siri on your iPhone, playing music or checking weather updates only scratches the surface of what this technology can accomplish. Today's Alexa can handle sophisticated voice commands, controlling Fire TV devices, managing daily routines and transforming your home into a fully automated smart environment. As we enter spring cleaning season, these capabilities become even more valuable for organizing your home and schedule, especially now with a smarter Alexa Plus with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis Topic:Tariffs While Donald Trump focuses on trade deficits with other nations, the US budget deficit continues to grow. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The turmoil on global markets has taken a breather ever since US President Donald Trump backed away from his grand plan to impose tariffs on almost every other country. Stock markets have recovered almost all the ground they lost in the aftermath of the Liberation Day chaos and even bond markets have scaled back the panic, with yields continuing to edge lower. But the turmoil is likely to resume soon. Consumers globally have scaled back spending, corporations are calibrating the extent to which earnings expectations need to be lowered, American retailers are bracing for shortages and economists now are tipping much lower global growth and the possibility of a US recession. That's because Mr Trump's main target, China, is still facing a broad-based tariff of 145 per cent, which effectively is a ban on Chinese imports. On-again-off-again tariffs and an intensifying trade war with China are taking their toll on ordinary Americans. Even if the China tariffs are halved, that would massively increase US costs and slow output across the globe. And, for what? The White House is convinced that America is a victim of half a century of unfair trade policies that have forced the American people to buy necessities from elsewhere and weakened its global position. According to the president: "It's not just China, the European Union, they ripped us off for many, many years and those days are over," he repeated over the weekend at a doorstop interview. So, is America being ripped off? And will tariffs fix the "problem"? Financial markets have recovered ground since the initial tariff shock and turbulence, but America's economic woes are far from settled. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) In Donald Trump's world, deficits are always bad and surpluses are always good. In isolation, it's an easy concept to sell to a deeply divided nation. You can point to a problem and then apportion blame. But it ignores the fact that the US economy has powered its way to global domination during this period. So, it can't be all bad. Most economists dismiss the idea that a trade deficit, even an ongoing one, is bad. America's trade deficit occurs for the simple reason that Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more from offshore than they sell to foreigners. No-one is forcing them to buy the stuff. It's not the fault of China, or that of Mexico or Canada for that matter. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. Last year, America exported $US4.8 trillion ($7.5 trillion) worth of goods and services and imported $US5.9 trillion in goods and services. That left a $US1 trillion gap, or deficit, which it financed by borrowing. Mostly, it is big corporations buying either finished goods to sell to US citizens or components they need to manufacture goods in the US. It isn't foreign governments behind a grand conspiracy to "rip off" Uncle Sam. It's American companies choosing to buy in goods from offshore. As economist Jeffrey Sachs notes: "Suppose that you go on a shopping binge, spending more than your earnings by running up credit-card debt. It's also worth noting that it is not all gimmicks and gadgets coming across the border. Often, it is high-end equipment needed for industry and specialist services. Put another way, America invests more money than it saves. Tariffs build a wall around your economy. Those walls protect local industry from outside competition and allow industries and firms that ordinarily wouldn't be able to compete to survive. The offset, however, is that consumers have to pay more. Importers pay the tariff and then pass on those higher costs to customers. Many products US shoppers buy are imported from China and now face steep tariffs. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Many Americans faced with the prospect of paying far more for imported goods may then switch back to locally-produced goods. But they would be buying items that they previously decided they couldn't afford. That means consumers will have less money to spend on other things and US economic growth is likely to slow. And the price hikes on imported goods means inflation will rise. Another downside is that businesses become accustomed to the protection and, with less competition, don't innovate, so falling behind the rest of the world. From toy brands to fashion labels, some Australian firms are facing tariffs way above the 10 per cent "baseline". There are other issues as well. As we saw in recent weeks, as soon as the US announced the tariffs, those on the receiving end retaliated. That makes it harder for US suppliers to sell into foreign markets. So, while American firms may end up selling more product to Americans, their offshore sales are likely to slump. Any benefit they may have received from being protected at home will be eliminated by penalties in their export markets.

(Reuters: David Ryder) The same goes for foreign firms — offshore sales will fall, which means global growth, not just America's, will slow. While the president bangs on about goods, he rarely mentions services. America exports a large amount of services to the rest of the world. In this area, it racks up a surplus. We're talking about things like education, tourism, software and information services. While the surplus is not enough to overcome the deficit in tradeable goods, the recent tariff hits have enraged other countries and seen a marked drop in foreign students wanting to enter the US, as well as an international backlash from tourists. As a result, the US trade deficit is likely to deteriorate as a result of the tariffs. America doesn't just run a trade deficit. It also runs a massive internal or budget deficit — and that is a far bigger problem. Years of handing out tax cuts to the extremely rich and vast overspending on defence has seen ongoing US budget deficits. You need to borrow to finance that, so the national debt has blown out to 122 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Tesla boss Elon Musk will cut back on his commitment to the Trump administration's DOGE and recommit to the carmaker, in a move cheered by investors after what analysts have called a "disaster" result. Those deficits continue to grow — during Trump's first term, he added $US8 trillion to the now bulging $US36.2 trillion in national debt, mostly through tax cuts. Joe Biden added a similar amount with his Inflation Reduction Act. America now spends more on servicing that debt each year than it spends on defence and the interest bill is the second biggest expense after social security. The White House often incorrectly mentions the national debt as being caused by the trade deficit which it then uses to justify tariffs. But if the tariffs cause GDP growth to slide or, worse, turn negative, then that debt situation could suddenly turn toxic. That's now becoming a real threat as large numbers of economists tip a US recession this year. Even worse, if the tariffs add to inflation and cause higher interest rates, servicing the debt will cost even more and the American economy could end up in serious trouble. America's financial stability has already been called into question by global investors. In the past month, they not only dumped Wall Street stocks, they abandoned US government bonds and the US dollar as well, a previously unimaginable set of events. While the Trump administration has taken aim at the US budget, hacking away at essential government services, it is looking at another massive tax cut for the wealthy which could further undermine the national finances. Globalisation was supposed to usher in a new era of wealth for the planet. Poorer countries would advance into the upper ranks more quickly and developed countries would reap the benefits. Many of those things came to pass, at least on paper. The problem was that the riches weren't doled out fairly. And the US was among the worst in shuffling the benefits through to the uber-rich. Wealth inequality blew out during the past half century. America may be rich on paper but the gap between the haves and the have-nots has widened into a yawning chasm. Mortality rates have risen, life expectancy has dropped, crime and incarceration levels have soared. The chaotic and hasty introduction of protectionism won't solve those problems. It could make them worse.

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!
