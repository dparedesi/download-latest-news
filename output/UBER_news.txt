The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority recently released data that found most investors aren’t using leveraged ETPs properly. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Sometimes, you just have to let it go. Leveraged exchange-traded products have been all the rage in recent months, with almost 60 new filings for funds that track companies like Google, Robinhood and Uber coming online in October alone. Total assets in leveraged US equity ETFs hit $125B as of Dec. 25, up from $106B at the end of 2024, according to Morningstar Direct. Across the pond, three of the top 10 most traded ETPs on the London Stock Exchange featured 3X leverage strategies, including the top traded fund in December: the Leverage Shares 3x Tesla ETP. Now, a UK securities regulator is raising red flags. The Financial Conduct Authority recently released data on how the products are being used by advisors and retail investors alike, and (you guessed it) most investors aren’t using them as intended. “Some consumers may intentionally hold these products longer as part of their investment strategy,” the authors of the report wrote. “But others may not fully understand the recommended holding periods, or the risks involved.” The review of 11 firms, including wealth managers and direct-to-consumer platforms, found 82% of trades were held longer than the recommended one-day window. In other words, investors forgot to read the fine print, just skimmed it or treated it like directions on assembling an Ikea coffee table. Some other problem areas included: To be sure, the regulator has no plans to ban the products, but it does expect firms to be far more intentional about who gets access to them. If harm is identified, the FCA said it expects firms to take proactive steps rather than wait for regulators to come knocking. “Complex ETPs that are held longer than intended are particularly susceptible to tracking errors due to daily price resets, increasing the potential for unexpected losses,” the FCA wrote. “Distributors should define and regularly review their target market for complex products at a granular level.” Hold On a Sec: While there are 3X funds trading in the states, US regulators aren’t thrilled with the flood of new highly leveraged products. The Securities and Exchange Commission sent warning letters to nine issuers in December — including Direxion, GraniteShares and ProShares — effectively stopping the review process for new funds with more than 2x exposure. “Regularly review the value your products provide,” the FCA wrote. “Where you identify issues or poor outcomes, we expect firms to take appropriate action, such as adjusting pricing or restricting access where necessary.” The actively managed fund is designed to generate additional income via call options. Forgoing mutual funds or direct stocks altogether makes sense for some, experts say. The $18 billion issuer has become the first to ask regulators to make existing shares of an ETF available on the blockchain. The move may fundamentally change how trading works, but will it offer a real advantage or just endless hours of marginal activity? Gen Z currently prefers individual stocks, but those that do own ETFs value advisor recommendations more highly. Retail investors can get private assets in a few ETFs, but there are limits on how much is in the portfolios and questions about valuations. Inflows to crypto ETFs are expected to continue this year, but stablecoins and tokenization will be areas to watch. Guggenheim Investments, which sold its US ETF line nine years ago, filed for six active funds, including an ultrashort bond product. Stocks in banks with big credit card businesses dipped Monday and Tuesday, and ETFs that invest in them were not immune. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Only select stores though OP might need that in title. 1 out of 6 stores around me has it and that doesn't allow pick up so no deal for me Rooster Rolls are absolutely top tier fast food. Real chicken, not tenders. Two of them would hit the spot All I buy there, ..Just wish they didn't microwave the f out of em. I'm a 8 beers and 0.25 vodka atm and the rooster roll is one of gods greatest creations Haha, had just ordered 4 rooster rolls, 2 for dinner, and 2 for lunch at work tomorrow. Truly the best. After i placed the first order, i was unable to get the same deal again? How were you able to place 2 orders for the same deal? I really like the pineapple fritters and colesaw also This comes and goes often, but gosh it’s terrible food. Soggy rolls with some blender chicken. The two posts above literally could not be any different if they tried. My personal opinion red rooster has better quality than the beef burger fast food joints trying their hands on chicken as well as better quality than kfc 100%. KFC at it's best is superb, but I don't find them consistent. Red Rooster is just such a great consistent option in my humble opinion $9 delivery is a killer Free with uber one because it's technically over the $20 threshold. But they still get you for like a 1.20 service fee Most of the Red Rooster outlets I see are empty, or hardly anyone is inside. Wonder how they make a profit or how they survive. My local dosen't even have tables for eat in- just counter seating. Most of their business is from drive through. Instead of disparaging the great rooter, instead support them Anyone found a store that allows pickup? Yeah there should be many wasnt able to use the offer for pick up orders though There’s no rooster roll in the menu, wtf? A red rooster store delisted the rolls AFTER I took advantage of this LOL. Every time I click the banner the rolls are missing from the menu. I've now switched to another red rooster store and the rolls now show up… So funny when Uber does deals for stores and the stores refuse to play ball. Ordered Rooster Rolls from my local store today for lunch. Unfortunately, I found that the amount of chicken provided was roughly a quarter of what is standard or advertised. It was essentially a bread roll with very little filling, which made for a very poor experience and poor value for money. Very disappointed. Don't know if anyone else had the same experience. definitely tell them. a rooster roll should be filled up properly All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.
