December 04, 2025 05:14 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD, HKEX: 0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, has attracted investment from ARK Invest (ARK), a leading investment firm managed by Cathie Wood. Based on its public disclosure, ARK acquired a total of 858,295 WeRide American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from public markets over the past three trading days, indicating confidence in the company's growth prospects and long-term strategic positioning in the autonomous mobility market. ARK’s investment aligns with its focus on disruptive innovation, as autonomous mobility is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar global market, with robotaxi fleets potentially reaching tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, according to ARK's "Big Ideas 2025" report. WeRide is well positioned to capture this growth, with over 1,600 autonomous vehicles (AVs) internationally and presence in over 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is the only company whose AVs hold autonomous driving permits in eight countries – China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and the US – highlighting strong regulatory trust in its technology. Earlier this week, Bank of America (BofA) initiated research coverage on WeRide at Buy with a price target of US$12 for its ADSs listed on NASDAQ and HK$31 for its Class A Ordinary Shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This represents an upside potential of 45.6% and 50.0% respectively, based on the November 28 closing prices of US$8.24 and HK$20.66. Other recent Buy ratings include Bank of China International (BOCI) (September 29, target price: US$20.00, 96% upside potential) and Citi (November 7, target price: US$15.30 and HK$39.601, 62% upside potential). Based on recent public filings, WeRide’s shareholders now include leading global institutions such as Bosch, Fidelity Management & Research, Greenwoods Asset Management, Hudson Bay Capital, Invesco, M&G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, NVIDIA, Temasek and multiple other long-only and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, among others. Grab, Southeast Asia's leading superapp, and Uber, the world’s largest mobility and delivery technology platform, are also shareholders in WeRide. WeRide’s strong Q3 2025 performance reflects the confidence shown by ARK and other major shareholders. WeRide recorded revenue of US$24.0 million, up 144.3% year-on-year (YoY), with its core Robotaxi business delivering US$5.0 million in revenue, up 761.0% YoY. Gross profit grew 1,123.9%, while gross margin rose 26.4 percentage points to 32.9%, placing WeRide among industry leaders and underscoring its path toward profitability. Founder and CEO Dr. Tony Han noted in a recent CNBC interview: “I'm very optimistic with WeRide's leading position in the global market and our technology. Profitability is a sure thing." This success stems from WeRide's commitment to staying at the forefront of the fast-evolving autonomous mobility market. WeRide One, the company’s universal autonomous driving technology platform for L2 to L4 vehicles, integrates full-stack software algorithms, modular hardware solutions, and cloud-based infrastructure, enabling strong synergy across mobility, logistics and sanitation products on open roads. WeRide’s rapid global expansion has not gone unnoticed among investors, supported by its proven track record in navigating complex regulatory environments and in consistently being a first mover across international markets. Notably, the company obtained the world’s first city-level fully driverless Robotaxi commercial permit outside the United States in Abu Dhabi and has already launched the fully driverless service on the Uber platform, with the operation on track to achieve breakeven unit economics. Besides Abu Dhabi, WeRide's AVs are deployed in Guangzhou, Beijing, Singapore, Riyadh, Dubai, Leuven (Belgium), etc., and its Robotaxi secured a driverless permit in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. WeRide plans to deploy 500-1,000 Robotaxis in the Middle East by end-2026, and tens of thousands worldwide by 2030. WeRide has achieved fully driverless Robotaxi operations in Guangzhou, Beijing and Abu Dhabi, and in Abu Dhabi, the WeRide-Uber Robotaxi service covers about half of Abu Dhabi core areas. BOCI analysts recently noted that "WeRide is poised to stand out as one of the final winners" as the global robotaxi industry scales. Reflecting this positive outlook, ARK’s stake in WeRide, alongside a strong shareholder base and Buy ratings from BOCI, BofA, CICC, Citi, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and other leading investment banks, demonstrates confidence that WeRide’s strategic execution and growing commercial footprint will drive long-term shareholder value. About WeRideWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company. Our autonomous vehicles have been tested or operated in over 30 cities across 11 countries.

Kevin Rose: Tim-Tim, another episode of The Random Show. Glad to be back. Tim Ferriss: Another episode of The Random Show. Kevin Rose: This is awesome. Tim Ferriss: You look very dashing. For people who can’t see you, you have hair slicked back, jacket with wide open lapels, reminiscent of a leather jacket. You look like a leading man from The Outsiders, that movie back in the day. You just need a cigarette in your pocket and some other goodies, but you’re looking good, looking good. You also have, as you disclosed to me, your secret weapon nearby an IKEA light that is providing very seductive shadows and contours on your face. So, well done. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think we’re both hacking it together today. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, today has been putting together the boxcar on the way down the hill in a sense, from an equipment standpoint, but here we are. Kevin Rose: Here we are. Tim Ferriss: We made it. Now, you asked me to grab a glass of wine, which I didn’t do. I ended up grabbing a glass of Gin, Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill gin. For anybody who’s curious, I do like my gin, B-A-R-R Hill. But this might surprise people and it surprised me because last time we spoke, I think you had hit, what was it, six months or however long it was. Six months sober. So what is unfolding before our very eyes? Kevin Rose: Well, what’s unfolding is a glass of champagne is what’s unfolding, but I’ll say that I almost made it to seven months, but then I just decided — my original goal was three months, and then I made it to six, and was I going to continue to go on like this? And I had hung out with some friends. We had a dinner in San Francisco, and I thought, “You know, I’m going to have a glass of vino. I’m just going to have a glass of wine because I don’t want to make this…” It was actually, there was a great book. You know the book Awareness, which you’ve recommended to me. Tim Ferriss: It’s one of my favorites. I have one of my many copies downstairs right now. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: Yeah. So, Anthony de Mello, Jesuit priest. Correct? Is that right? Tim Ferriss: Jesuit priest, who is also a psychotherapist who is now since passed, but incredibly, incredibly compelling writing. I’m sure we’ll get more into this because I listened to the audiobook you recommended, so we’ll come back to that. Kevin Rose: Oh, cool. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But all right, so take us back to the story you’re telling. So, you’re sitting there — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Well, prior to that, I had re-listened to that book and I got it on audio. And one of the things that hit me that he said in the book was — Tim Ferriss: I know what it was. Can I guess? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you do. Yeah, go for it. Tim Ferriss: That abstinence or asceticism. Renunciation is as much a trap, or can be as much a trap as anything else because it ties you, it binds you to the thing that you are from. Kevin Rose: That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. It makes it your lifelong enemy. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And it binds you to it. And so, you’re like, “Fuck it, Yolo. Let’s have some wine.” Kevin Rose: Well, I want to be bound to it. And then I did that with a glass of wine, so no, but I — Tim Ferriss: Break those chains. Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. But the plan was never to be sober for life. It was to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol and get to a point where I could truly say to anyone that asks, the cravings have gone away. And my goal going forward is something I just call the 2-2-2 rule, which is maximum of two drinks at any given night, never two days in a row, and then two days a week. So, just lightweight. That’s my new thing. And then also special occasions, I want it to be about a celebration of something or a gathering in some way that’s meaningful, not just because a football game’s on or something. Tim Ferriss: Well, first I have more to say, but cheers. I have my little Japanese mug — Kevin Rose: Cheers. Tim Ferriss: — full of Barr Hill gin. Cheers. Kevin Rose: Wait, wait, straight up gin? Tim Ferriss: That’s just straight gin. I didn’t have any ice. You’ve inspired me to cut way back on my drinking, so I haven’t really had much. I don’t want to open a bottle of wine that I’m not going to finish with friends or something. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I mean, you finished your bottle of gin. Tim Ferriss: So I just grabbed what I had open, which stay good for a long while once open, which was this gin. So, I’m not going to drink a full glass of gin, but I will have a sip with you. Kevin Rose: I think we’re both going to be cheap dates maybe then, because if we haven’t drank in a while, we might get really sloppy really fast. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very cheap dates. So, let me follow up on this story and the 2-2-2 plan. How are you intending, if at all, to catch yourself if you start slipping? Do you have people who you want to hold you accountable? Do you have some type of calendar reminder in place? How do you keep an eye on that? Recognizing that you may very well be totally fine, but given the history that you have, it seems like it’d be a good idea to put some guardrails in there. Kevin Rose: Well, I agree with you wholeheartedly if my issue with alcohol had been one of excess consumption in that, I was never a six or seven drink or even five drink person. For me, it was more consistency. So, the one that is easier to catch is you wake up the next morning and you say, “Okay, I’m just not drinking tonight because you’re catching it in a sober state, which is huge.” So, it’s the big foul that I had over the last few years, especially to start with COVID was just two drinks a night, maybe three, and just continuing that and taking a day or two off a week, that’s not healthy as my liver enzymes would report back. I’m not as concerned about that. But also, I’ve talked to my therapist about this and she’s amazing. And she’s like, “Hey, I’m going to check in with you and just make sure that you’re truly sticking to this.” But I think an accountability partner is absolutely a necessity, especially when it’s been such a staple of your life for decades. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. And I think for you, one thing that immediately hops to mind, which seems super mundane, but I know you have a lot of anxiety around flying, and I don’t think that flying counts as a special occasion, right? So, you’ll need to — Kevin Rose: Oh, it absolutely does. It absolutely does. That flying — Tim Ferriss: You fly so much though. Kevin Rose: We are in the air, we shouldn’t be able to do that as humans. It is an amazing feat of engineering. So, yes, it’s special. Tim, don’t take this away from me, God damn it. Tim Ferriss: All right. Wow, I’m going to — Kevin Rose: This is one thing. Tim Ferriss: I’m going to call that the yellow flag in the making, but you know what — Kevin Rose: I’m fine with one yellow flag. I do fly a bit, but you know what’s funny is when I came back from SFO when I actually had that first drink, I didn’t want a second drink on the plane. And honestly, it’s that just like anxiety of the whole process of it all, the security and the packed jets and the people coughing next to you. And once I get settled, I’m pretty good, unless it’s an international flight and I’m with friends. So, yeah, I think it’s that first drink actually goes a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. On that note, first drink goes a long way, especially if it’s just straight up gin. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: Where else should we segue? Because we can come back to this, but we have a lot to catch up on. There is lot. Kevin Rose: So much to catch up on and why don’t we just go back and forth and just have it be an old school Random Show where everything’s random, we have no idea we’re about to talk about. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s go for it. So, I’ll share an update on my side, which folks might find interesting. As you know and long-term listeners know, I have been one way you could put it as an early adopter looking at bioelectric medicine of different types, whether that is legitimate vagus nerve stimulation. By the way, there aren’t many options that would fall in that category, interviewing people like Dr. Kevin Tracey, but also looking at most acutely transcranial magnetic stimulation. So, TMS, which is a form of brain stimulation. I’ll keep it simple, that has existed for decades. But there was an innovation by the very recently late Nolan Williams, sadly, and others called accelerated TMS, where you basically take something like 50 stimulations, like 50 different sessions. And you compress it into one week, as opposed to doing it over the course of many months. And this type of dense dosing schedule produces some, in many people, incredible effects. And you saw me after my first experience of accelerated TMS, which was with a device called MagVenture device. It uses neuro targeting. So, you need a resting state fMRI and so on to determine where they’re actually going to place this stimulation depending on your condition and your own individual anatomy and activity. So, if it’s depression, they might point it in one direction or in one place. If it’s anxiety or OCD, they might point it somewhere else. And I effectively had, let’s just call it eight or nine out of 10, resting state generalized anxiety. Kevin Rose: Was this self-reported? Meaning, when you went in there to get the resting state scan, were you like, “Hey, I’m coming in here with ED and general anxiety, I need you to treat this for me.” And then they would — Tim Ferriss: Did you say ED? Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. I know it’s an issue, but oh, we can cut this if you want. We can cut this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, nice, nice. Very cute. Kevin Rose: No, but all the joking aside — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Kevin Rose: — how did you determine the areas? Did you have to tell them, this is what I’m coming in to treat, or is this something they see? Tim Ferriss: Well, they do interviews and assessments that are qualitative. Let’s just say asking you what your symptoms are, why are you coming here in the first place? Then they would dig into the details and then they would run you through various standardized tests or assessments. So, you might have the MADRS, you might have the HAM-D. You might have the Y-BOCS. They’re different assessments that are accepted as standardized for diagnosing, say OCD or any number of other psychiatric conditions. And then you get an fMRI. So, you get this scan of your brain, which I did at, I think it was Mass General in Massachusetts as you would guess. And based on that, they can do some precision targeting. And just to give people the upshot of that, I did five days of stimulations and that gave me basically three to four months of effectively a zero on a scale of zero to 10 of generalized anxiety. So, from that point forward, effectively, no anxiety. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: The rumination, the anxious mental loops that I would get involved with late at night, that would then in turn affect my sleep and cause onset insomnia, et cetera, that went to zero for a period of say, three to four months, which blew my mind. Kevin Rose: Just out of curiosity, were you tracking Oura data and whatnot, so you could see the impact of this as measured by different devices? Tim Ferriss: I wasn’t looking at Oura at that point in time. I have been tracking with Oura at least for the last three to four weeks. And so, I’m going to be taking a closer look at things like HRB and so on in terms of trending. But the upshot of it is that, and I’ll try to compress this a little bit. But that first time I did accelerated TMS, I had this incredible effect, much more durable in terms of its intensity of effect and relief than even any psychedelic therapy, or psychedelic assisted therapy that I’ve looked into. And those were effectively ended up being the two modalities with the greatest effect size on the psychiatric conditions that I was most personally interested in. And where I have funded a lot of early stage science. Unfortunately, when I then went to do boosters to do shorter duration, two or three days, nothing happened. So, my symptoms started creeping back in, which seemed to be hereditary. Just to put that out there, right? I recognize objectively, I’m like, “There isn’t really anything I should be so anxious about. I recognize that very clearly. Nonetheless, I get caught in these OCD/GAD, generalized anxiety disorder loops, and I see that in family members. So, it seems to be somewhat genetic. In any case, none of these boosters worked. And then I was like, “Fuck, this is terrible. Okay, well let me go back and do the full five days.” Full five days, didn’t do anything. And then I was looking back at the calendar and trying to identify anything that might have correlated, or preceded the first treatment that helped make it work. And I did see that I’d spent a few weeks in the Amazon maybe ending about two weeks prior to that treatment. So, since I was ingesting plants of various types that are known to induce some degree of neuroplasticity, I thought, well, it could be that it was a plasticity issue, a preconditioning that helped that first session. So, I tried to replicate that using psilocybin and did another five days, no effect, didn’t have any effect, and was starting to feel really hopeless about this. But then came across some research that this is going to sound pretty wild, and this is definitely early, early stages. So, to my knowledge, I’m maybe one out of fewer than a hundred people who have been one of the first monkeys shot in the space doing this specifically for anxiety. It has been applied to more people with depression, but decided to try simultaneous dosing with something called D-cycloserine (DCS). So, D-cycloserine, D-C-Y-C-L-O-S-E-R-I-N-E, is very, very interesting. So, it is an antibiotic that historically has been used to treat tuberculosis and urinary tract infections, but it is also now being studied. And for the last several years, people have been looking at this as a cognitive enhancer for treating various neuropsychiatric conditions. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Now, how they figured this out, I’m not sure. I mean, it could have been working backwards through the purported mechanism of action. So, D-cycloserine has been looked at in conjunction with say, CBT, like cognitive behavioral therapy and all sorts of different things. And part of what people believe makes it effective as an amplifier of effects, although there can be side effects and sometimes the pendulum swings the other direction is that it is a partial agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Now, ketamine also works on NMDA receptors, but it’s an antagonist. So, it’s very different in that respect. But I will again try to cut to the punchline. So, instead of doing five days, I did one day, just one day of basically a stimulation every hour on the hour for 10 hours and preloaded with a lozenge that you just let of melt in your mouth with this D-cycloserine, and it worked one day. It had some side effects. I had insomnia for about two weeks, which seems to happen in some patients who have undergone this. Some people have really bad insomnia for a month and then it goes away. And I was willing to take that risk. There’s some other things that can crop up, like temporary loss of some fine motor control and some other weird stuff. Kevin Rose: Oh, Jesus. Tim Ferriss: Tinnitus in some people. Kevin Rose: Wow, with just the treatment in general. Did the papers that you’re signing and say, this may happen? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, with any of this stuff, you’re writing your life away with some signatures. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s like frontier stuff. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but the point that I’m trying to make here in a pretty long-winded way is number one, it worked. So, that leads me to believe that the original hypothesis that it was around neuroplasticity, so I needed to warm up the Play-Doh before it could be molded properly, could be accurate, right? That could be true. Secondly, and this is incredibly important, most people I know who are really busy, or most people who can’t afford it, can’t take five days off of work. They can’t take a week off of work to do this treatment no matter how bad their symptoms might be. And the fact that this D-cycloserine, like DCS enhanced treatment was able to be compressed into a single day, I feel like it opens up the multitude of people who can potentially use this tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, who knows? And it should also at the same time really decrease the cost. So, it’s made me even more bullish around accelerated TMS, and it’s been, I’d have to go back and look maybe a month, six weeks, but it’s still sticking, which is remarkable. So, in any case, for people who want to hear more, they can listen to my podcast with Nolan Williams that goes into a lot of detail around this, but very exciting stuff. It turns out a lot of these things might be interrelated and that certain types of TMS when implemented properly actually seem to also stimulate the vagus nerve in some interesting ways. So, this is the next frontier that I’m most interested in exploring right now is bioelectric medicine, right? So, computer chips over pills and so on. I think it allows you, in some respects to get much more targeted. So, that’s good news for me, but I think it’s also obviously at the edges of medicine right now. But I think that in the next two to three years, I could see this becoming a much more accessible therapeutic for millions of people. And there’s some companies you can watch. I mentioned one MagVenture or Magventures. The other is called Brainsway, and they’re actually a very small company, but publicly traded, and I’m sure there are going to be more entrants. So, super exciting stuff. But now I feel like I have a recipe worth trying to replicate where maybe once a quarter, maybe twice a year, depending on when — I think I see symptoms start to creep back in. I don’t think this is a one and done, nor is any psychedelic assisted therapy that I’m aware of. So, I expect it’ll be some type of ongoing treatment that I do one, two to four times per year. Kevin Rose: And when you think of the potential in one and inability to replicate this again in others, I know you put a lot of cash personally into philanthropic things around research and studies, are you curious to push on these buttons and see, can you put together a trial with 50 people and Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Kevin Rose: What’s your thoughts there? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would definitely be interested in funding more research. The Brain Stimulation Lab at Stanford, I’ve already funded some research within. Very sadly, Nolan Williams, who helped develop a lot of these technologies died, I mean I want to say it was a month or two ago by suicide, very sadly. Kevin Rose: Oh, jeez. Tim Ferriss: And he was a friend and really heartbreaking to see. And I mean it’s hard to put that aside for the moment, but putting it aside for the moment, I did fund research within that lab. I suspect that’s going to take time to implement, particularly given the leadership vacuum that was created by his very, very tragic death. But I am interested in funding more research, and this is an ongoing thing. As you know, my foundation, the Saisei Foundation, has funded all sorts of on the edge research since 2015 or so, I would say. So, this is for sure where I would like to fund more research, particularly looking at these combinations. And that could be something like these, like a D-cycloserine plus stimulation. And at certain clinics, they have cohorts of say 60 — I think it’s at the time that I did it, there were 60 patients who had been treated for some form of anxiety disorder with this combination. I think that at least at that particular clinic on the depression side, the numbers are larger, probably 200 or so. But it’s exciting, it’s exciting. I mean that’s enough to get a signal, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And sure, you need to check all the boxes and do the randomized placebo controlled studies with multiple arms and all that, but it is enough to start to see a signal, especially when you have treatment resistant cases that haven’t responded to other things. And that’s enough to inform at least the design of a study that would take much longer. So, we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But I will say that much some people experience with GLP-1 agonists like Tirzepatide, and Mounjaro or Ozempic or whatever, after these treatments and maybe it’s just from really putting the brakes on a lot of the OCD like circuitry, that I had much less desire to over consume caffeine, to over consume alcohol. It made dialing all of those things back a lot easier, which has been — Kevin Rose: And you know that’s a massive benefit of GLP-1s for a lot of people? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which is huge. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Well, dude, I’m pumped for you, man. It’s like I love to see you getting some relief here, even if just for a few months, and that’s fantastic, it’s repeatable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. So, fingers crossed. We’ll see. And for people who want to learn more, I would suggest they start with, as eerie as it might be, my conversation on the podcast with Nolan Williams. All right, man, you’re up. What’s next? Kevin Rose: Speaking of brain-related things, I was out a dinner with a friend and I was lamenting in talking about just my inability to remember faces, names, and then how that extended into childhood for me, which was doing poorly on tests and just I couldn’t quite retain the information the way that my friends could. I just could never explain it. Somebody at dinner, my buddy Mao said to me, “Do you have aphantasia?” And I said, “I have no idea what that is.” And then he said, “Okay, I want you to close your eyes right now,” and this is going to blow some people’s minds right now. “Close your eyes and picture an apple in your mind’s eye. Picture an apple. What do you see? Do you see a red apple? Do you see water droplets on it? Does it look fresh? Does it look like an HD image?” And that’s what he said to me. I go, “What are you talking about?” And he goes, “Well, what does it look like to you?” And I go, “There’s no apple.” He goes, “What do you mean there’s no apple?” And I said, “Well, there’s like an outline, ghosty foggy thing, maybe-ish.” And he goes, “Oh, you have aphantasia.” And I was immediately jumped, whatever, ChatGPT. And I had no idea that people suffer from this condition and it’s in the low single digit percentage of people, and they have no idea that this is a thing where you cannot picture something in your mind’s eye. Had you heard of this before or no? Tim Ferriss: No, I hadn’t until you dropped it in one of our group friend text threads. This was, I guess a couple of weeks ago. But Fantasia is spelled like the Disney movie, but actually no, that would be with an F. It’s aphantasia, A-P-H-A-N-T-A-S-I-A, yeah, is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images first described in 1880. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: When you close your eyes, what do you see? Because they give you a scale there, and a five is like an HD full on, beautiful apple. What do you see? Do you see a perfect quality apple? Tim Ferriss: So aphantasia can be considered the opposite of hyperphantasia. I am the exact opposite. I have hyper-visual recall and the ability — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — to visualize. So I can probably draw the vast majority of restaurants or the floor plans that I’ve ever visited, right? I can absolutely spec it out and have very, very vivid visualization. So I would be on the far other end of the spectrum. Kevin Rose: So when you think of a new idea, do you see it in some ways? Because I feel it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You are very similar to my friend Mike, because I remember Mike and I have a lot of shared flight time with psychedelic experiences, and he was describing how he has almost no visual imagery, and it’s almost purely kinesthetic for him. And that is as hard for me to imagine as it is for him to imagine my experience, which is overwhelmingly explosively visual. Kevin Rose: What’s crazy, dude, is how many things I think I thought were jokes. When people said they counted sheep before they went to bed. I was like, “Oh, that’s funny. Would you count numbers in your head?” But I didn’t know they see sheep. I didn’t know. And if you’re younger, mute the podcast for 10 seconds, I didn’t know the spank bank was a real bank you could visit. I thought I didn’t even know that was a thing. I seriously didn’t — Tim Ferriss: Well, to be clear, it’s not a bank with tellers and — Kevin Rose: No, but it is in your head. Tim Ferriss: — safety security boxes. Kevin Rose: It’s in your head. You can open up the box and go back and see that. I can’t see any of that. It sucks. My buddy from Diggnation Podcast was like, after we stopped recording, he’s like, “”You’ve got to be kidding me. So, you can’t go back and look at people you’ve dated in the past during intimate moments and see, revisualize that?” I’m like, “No, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And he goes, “Oh, yeah.” He’s like, “Oh,” he felt so bad for me. He was almost starting to cry for me. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Tim Ferriss: What do you think you have, if anything, developed in compensation of that? Kevin Rose: Well, the one thing that I have never been able to explain is that the feeling side of it, everything is that everything is a feeling. So I have a friend of mine, and I’m not this way, but she composes music and she said that she sees in her head music is represented as colors. And so, when I come up with ideas for projects, I’m not seeing something. I’m traversing a feeling of a path, rather than a visual thing. It’s funny you mentioned the fear of flying. I think part of the reason why I have such a vivid fear of flying is that feeling comes so strong of the plane crashing, not that I see the plane crashing. So, it’s just a different thing, but I wouldn’t trade that for the world. That has served me quite well in investing and seeing around corners early and things of that nature. But when I explain that to people, you feel a new idea. There’s been a bunch of people that have no idea what I’m talking about and something they can’t. I think you can probably have both, but new ideas come from this rising of feeling, not visual, if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: Wild. I mean, it doesn’t really make sense to me, but it would make sense to my friend Mike. And thinking about all this and hearing about your friend who I think you said sees musical notes as colors, that’s often referred to as synesthesia. And there’s a really amazing little book that I read ages ago. It’s been around for a long time. I’m looking at it right now. It was published in 1987, but it’s 192 pages. Anyone who’s interested in memory and mind and the vast differences between people might be interested in this, it’s called The Mind of a Mnemonist, I think is how it’s pronounced, like mnemonic device, M-N-E-M-O-N-I-S-T, a little book about a vast memory. The author’s name is A.R. Those are initials, A.R. Luria, L-U-R-I-A. And here the description’s very short, so I’ll just read it. “This study explores the inner world of a rare human phenomenon — a man who was endowed with virtually limitless powers of memory. From his intimate knowledge of S., the mnemonist, gained from conversations and testing over a period of almost thirty years, A.R. Luria is able to reveal in rich detail not only the obvious strengths of S.’s astonishing memory but also his surprising weaknesses: his crippling inability to forget, his pattern of reacting passively to life, and his uniquely handicapped personality.” Fascinating, fascinating book that I really recommend to people, but aphantasia, who knew? Kevin Rose: You know who I should talk to is Joshua Waitzkin, because didn’t he say that he feels chess? And for people that don’t know, he was the guy that was based on the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Searching for Bobby Fischer was originally a book and then a movie, which was based on the childhood chess prodigy chapters of Josh Waitzkin’s life. And Josh hates that term prodigy. He has some unusual hardware to be sure, but he also has a really incredible framework that he’s applied to now four or five different fields to become world-class in all of them. But he does have a feeling about certain things. One of the stories that he has told me is he was playing a simul, which means he was playing, I don’t know what the number was, 30 or 20 to 40 people simultaneously where he is walking around a room and playing — Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, you do it really fast, right? You just look and then move. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he’s just moving from table to table really quickly, and I think was with some very high level high school players, something like that. Maybe they were younger, I can’t recall. But he was going around, he’s playing 20 or 30 simultaneous games in his head. And then at one point, he explained it as it feels like you’re juggling 20 or 30 balls in the air. And then he got to one table and he felt all the balls come crashing to the ground. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And he said, it felt as though I just missed a ball, and they’d all fallen on the ground, and he couldn’t quite figure out why that was the case. And then he was able to deduce that one of the kids had cheated, one of the kids had moved a piece. Kevin Rose: Oh, no way. Tim Ferriss: And it was just a gut feeling. And then that visual that allowed him to figure out which of the kids had cheated. It’s just insane. Kevin Rose: Holy shit. Tim Ferriss: That people can even do that. Yeah, yeah. Josh. Yeah, if you want to listen to Joshua Waitzkin’s first ever podcast, you were podcast episode number one, and he was podcast episode number two, if I remember correctly. Kevin Rose: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Wild character. Oh, man. Let’s see. Kevin Rose: All right, you’re up. Tim Ferriss: I’m up. Well, I’ll give another medical one that I think is interesting. And I’ve been texting and interacting with Matt Walker a lot on this. Matt is a scientist. He wrote a book, Why We Sleep, and is about as credible as you can be within the world of sleep science and — Kevin Rose: He’s the best. And he’s a great human. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. Kevin Rose: Fantastic human. Tim Ferriss: Great guy, has the most pleasing dulcet tones with that British accent and kind lilt in the voice. Kevin Rose: Plus 10 IQ accent, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Plus 10 or 20 IQ points with the accent. But his podcast is also excellent, and we can link to it in the show notes, but he did an episode on a class of sleep medication called DORAs and DORA stands for dual orexin receptor antagonists. And the reason that DORAs became very interesting to me is that I have Alzheimer’s in my family, and it’s left right and center for me right now because I have three relatives currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and I — Kevin Rose: Holy shit. That’s your APOE e4 negative folks? Tim Ferriss: It includes APOE e4 negative folks. So, we won’t get too far into the genetics, but people who should not be, based on that particular parameter, should not be particularly inclined to Alzheimer’s, nonetheless have Alzheimer’s. And then there are of course people who have three, four, I don’t think any of them are APOE e33, I am APOE e34. So, compared to a 33 that, at least, as I understand it would predispose me and say 2.5 times. Kevin Rose: You and my wife and Rhonda Patrick, and Attia, too, actually is a 34. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there you go. Kevin Rose: All of you guys. I’m the only one that’s not. Crazy. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, in effect, to our current understanding, you want to mitigate the accumulation of two things, is one is beta amyloid plaque, another is tangles that are created by tau proteins. And sleep is really imperative for this. And if you have sleep issues as I have for decades, the onset insomnia, low percentage of deep sleep, et cetera, you’re effectively unable to have your garbage service within the brain clear out these at a rate that offsets the accumulation. Kevin Rose: But we don’t know if these are causal, right? There’s never been any conclusion whether these are causal. They’re most likely the protective effects of something else gone awry. Do you agree with that? Tim Ferriss: I would say that, based on our best understanding, if you can mitigate the accumulation of these things, there seems to be, at the very least, delaying of the progression of these diseases. And there are different drugs and fusions like Donanemab and so on that are predicated on that understanding of the mechanism. This is still early days in the world of Alzheimer’s, but it seems very defensible with our understanding currently that the less of this stuff you accumulate, the better off you are. Kevin Rose: Do you follow Dale Bredesen’s work, by the way? Tim Ferriss: I don’t. Let’s come back to that. Kevin Rose: Okay. Tim Ferriss: Let me just quickly tie this up and say that an example of a DORA would be Belsomra. There are many others, or I should say a handful of others, but I have taken as I believe you have — well, actually no, it was too strong for you, but — Kevin Rose: I gave you some, dude. Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah, that’s right. You gave me the Belsomra. Kevin Rose: I gave you a bunch of Belsomra and you were going to give me some other shit back and you never gave me anything good. Tim Ferriss: Well, hold on, hold on. That’s still pending, but let me come back. So, you gave me the Belsomra, but I said using it, I was going to get it on a prescription. It’s expensive as fuck. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I paid a shit-ton for it, and then I didn’t use it. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, all right, I’ll take your Belsomra. But the Trazodone, I got off of Trazodone and switched as a sleep medication to, in this case, Belsomra, because it was literally down the street in an Uber at your house, not recommending you use your friend’s bootleg drugs, by the way, talk to your doctor, but — Kevin Rose: We also have physicians that are looking at all our shit, so it’s not — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, right. But I have been, now, on Belsomra for a few months as hopefully a — it’s too strong to say it’s a preventative strategy, but at least a delay strategy for potentially Alzheimer’s and other associated neurodegenerative conditions. So, I would encourage people, and I’ll link to this in the show notes, to check out Matt Walker’s podcast on this specifically. Kevin Rose: You know what they did with Belsomra where they tap the spines of people that took it and they noticed there were less tau, the proteins in the spinal fluid? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they cleared a lot more. I mean, I think it was they looked at animal models and then they looked at humans. And in that podcast episode also, Matt discusses data related to comparing, say Belsomra or I should say DORAs to Ambien, right? And not all sleep medications are created equal. A lot of sleep medications effectively sedate you. But in the case of DORAs, orexin, as I understand it, is a wakefulness. Hmm, I think it’s a hormone, but this is effectively inhibiting wakefulness as opposed to sedating. And by using that particular approach, you’re able to create more naturalistic sleep. So it’s preserving sleep architecture, increasing certain things like REM sleep. In any case, it’s very interesting because as it stands, look, sure, like exercise for a natural release of cloth, watch your diet, blah, blah, blah. There are a handful of things here. Sleep, super critically important if we’re talking about, again, staving off, hopefully neurodegenerative disease, but there really just aren’t that many tools in the toolkit. So, to come across some of this data via Matt Walker was very eye-opening to me. So, that’s — Kevin Rose: That’s awesome. Tim Ferriss: That’s also something that I’m looking at really closely. Kevin Rose: I will say the scariest test I have done in my life was about three months ago. I went and had my blood work done and had the towel, the full on, you can check your blood now to see if you are producing, or we’re always producing it, but if you’re out of bounds, meaning you’re above the norm in your production of these types of proteins. And if you are, it’s like 99 percent chance you’re on the path to some form of dementia, right? And did you do that test? Tim Ferriss: I have just done a whole battery of different tests. And — Kevin Rose: Did you do the p-tau one though? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m going to have all that stuff. So, I will — Kevin Rose: It’s scary, dude. You come hang with me, we’ll have a drink or something. Tim Ferriss: I’m looking at all my results in probably two or three weeks because I have a few online batteries that I’m going to do assessments. Kevin Rose: It is absolutely terrifying because the doctor was like, “Hey, do you want to do this? I have this available.” And I was like, “Sure, go ahead.” And then three days afterwards, I’m like, “I should look up what that test is all about.” And there’s three of them now that can detect these various proteins that are essentially, if you have elevated levels, you’re on marching orders or you’re heading towards some type of dementia. And I realized that and I was like, “Wow, if this comes back positive, this is an emergency situation where high intensity interval training every single morning for an hour. There’s a lot of things you have to get into.” And it’s a very frightening thing. It’s a very frightening thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it can be super frightening. And there’s certain other things that I think are just holistically good for my particular goals, cognitive, psychological, physical, like the ketogenic diet. I recently did a podcast with David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, and he and his wife have a foundation that it is the largest funder of science related to metabolic therapies with a particular focus on ketogenic therapy. So, I will be doing all of December in ketosis as an example. Kevin Rose: Oh, that’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just to keep that metabolic machinery humming because I do think it’s plausible that it could help longterm with a lot of the stuff we’re talking about. Kevin Rose: So, Tim, real quick, just to put a bow on this, Dale. Yeah, so the reason I like Dale, Dale’s a scientist that studies all forms of dementia. He has a book called The End of Alzheimer’s. You’ve probably heard of that book. It’s pretty popular. Tim Ferriss: I’ve come across his name. Yeah. Kevin Rose: He’s a little bit different than most of the scientists out there where he believes that Alzheimer’s and these other dementias, they’re not just a one size fits all, one thing went wrong, but it can be a suite of different things that go wrong that lead you down this path. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: And so, it’s metabolic disorder, it’s potential toxins. I think he’s like the four major contributors to different various forms of dementia. And he’s developed this protocol that can stabilize and even reverse a lot of this early cognitive decline if you catch it early enough. And it’s a little bit of throwing the whole kitchen sink at it because it’s everything. And he’s not quite sure exactly what is doing in the fix here, but it’s fascinating, the research that he’s done, two things that stood out to me that he recommends is one, getting this p-tau test done on the blood front and then also recommends the ketogenic diet. And this ketogenic diet is huge for people. And he’s seen that alone stabilize people from mental decline. And not that they’re not eventually going to get it, but the point is, do you want to go into full decline within five years or do you want it to be 15 years, right? And so, that’s what his lab’s focused on. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Yeah, I’ll check him out. I mean I’ve seen, not that this is a necessarily sustainable or scalable approach, but with some of my relatives with Alzheimer’s where it’s pretty progressed and they tend to give one word answers or get confused and give the wrong answer to questions, giving them, say, 35 milliliters of exogenous ketones. So, they’re not in ketosis, they’re following the terrible diet they’ve always followed, but give them 35 milliliters of high octane exogenous ketones before going for a walk. And within 30 minutes, they’re speaking in full sentences. I mean, you see some really wild temporary, but nonetheless, very interesting transformations, which comes back to what you said about metabolic syndrome. And there are good reasons why some folks refer to Alzheimer’s as type three diabetes, right? Kevin Rose: A hundred percent. And that’s what he says in his book. He’s like, that is definitely a contributor, like excess blood glucose levels and all the downstream inflammation effects that come from that. It’s Bad News Bears, as you like to say. That’s Tim Ferriss is — Tim Ferriss: Bad News Bears. All right, Kevin, what have you got? Kevin Rose: I wanted to give people a quick little update on the State of the Union around all things AI. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, please. I could use it too. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s just such a fascinating time in that every, I’d call it four to eight weeks, maybe a slight bit longer, sometimes less so, we’re seeing leapfrogs in what is possible. And one of the things that I would caution people against is forming an opinion about AI and then locking yourself in time around that opinion. I’ll give you a great practical example. I have a lot of engineers that said, “Hey, I tried AI for coding. It was horrible. My first question is, when did you try it? And they said, “Oh, three months ago.” And I’m like, “No, no, you don’t understand. It’s three to four times better than it was three months ago,” right? And so, we have to make sure that even if you are looking at some of these technologies and say, “Hey, it can’t do X or it’s horrible, it’s hallucinating in this way. It’s giving me the wrong answer. This is without a doubt the massive Motorola block phone version of the iPhone.” We are in that realm of AI, the very first innings of it all and every few months. I mean even Opus four or five came out three, four days ago, whatever, it’s a means — Tim Ferriss: Explain what that is. Kevin Rose: Okay, so when you think about frontier models, meaning do you have the bigs Anthropic, you’ve got Google, you’ve OpenAI, OpenAI, and then I’d throw a couple others in there, Meta’s trying in some sense and perplexity and whatnot. But when you think about the big massive models that are running that are at the bleeding edge of all this, meaning they’re the best of the best, the most expensive per query, what happens is they have to train these data sets and then they go in and they eventually release a model, right? And these are typically marked by software versioning numbers know ChatGPT 3 versus ChatGPT 4 versus ChatGPT 5, and then they’ll do 51, 52 or 41, 42 or whatever. So, it’s like software kind of versioning on these models. And whenever you see a new release, you’re talking a jump in terms of both sometimes the capacity to understand information, and they call that the token context windows. And then also their just natural built-in abilities of the things that they can do well. And so, some things they can do at a graduate level now, some things they can do, their novel ideas is still pretty low down the chain in terms of what they can do around original thinking. But they have all these benchmarks, so they have probably 15 or 20 different benchmarks that they run it against. Can it complete the bar exam is one, right? And so, now they’re able to do it, and then now the question is how quickly can they do it in? It would take them 25 minutes before now it’s five minutes. So, then there’s a bunch of inference side of benchmarking as well. So, we’re seeing Gemini 3 came out just a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic. And I will say that I called NVIDIA on here way back in the day. It was 1.8 trillion I think back in the day when I said, “Hey, I think this is going to run, when you and I were talking about it,” and it did because I knew GPUs were just going to be the most precious commodity we have as technologists. I have seen that Google now is in the driver’s seat here and I’m really excited for them because one, I worked at Google, they acquired one of my companies and I spent a few years there. And I’ve seen inside the belly of the, and I will tell you that they were built for this day and age, the fact that they’ve been training their entire life for this moment. They have all of the PhDs and all of the folks that they need to go pull this off across the entire suite. And so, what do I mean by the entire suite? And this is where it gets really interesting, Tim. If you think about what OpenAI has to do to compete, they have to go and buy up as much data center space as possible, and they have to buy a shit ton of GPUs from NVIDIA. That’s what they need because they don’t own the stack. They own the software, the training, the engineering, the soft good side of the business, but they don’t own the hardware side. This is a fantastic, really interesting stat. When Gemini three came out a couple weeks ago, it was the first time they had trained a frontier model. The best of best when it dropped, it was the best model in the world exclusively on Google chips. So, they have these chips called TPUs, tensor processing units. They have the full stack dude, they don’t even need NVIDIA. It’s wild. They didn’t use an NVIDIA chip to train their AI and they have world-class AI. So, it’s just really exciting. This is such a fun time to be alive because right now, you can take someone that is a technologist in the sense that they have a rough understanding of the available tech that’s out there, and you could build and produce and ship any app that you want within a few days now with what we have, and it’s just going to get better and better. So, the creativity and the shipping unlockments that we’re about to see over the next five years is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. If you have the idea for an app or a product or service, anything digital, you will be able to take it from ideation and drawing it on a piece of paper to actual shipping something to your customers within, call it less than a week, which is just never been done before at a price that is, I don’t know, $500, right? And so, if Tim wanted his own app five years ago, I’d have been like, “Okay, great. You want the Tim Ferriss fan site/ed help app, then to build that would be 50 grand,” right? Tim Ferriss: I feel like you have a problem that we need to talk about. You’re just bringing it up so much. After that half a glass of champagne, I feel like — Kevin Rose: It went straight to my head, number one and number two — Tim Ferriss: Turning into a mini confessional here. Kevin Rose: We need to talk about your relationships because one of the things that whenever I get on — Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy. Kevin Rose: No, I’m telling you whenever we do a Random Show, people are always like, they send me messages and they’re like, “I love how you give him shit, number one, and number two, we want to hear more about his personal life.” And I know you’ve got a new special someone in your life, which I’m very excited for. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that. Yeah, nice segue. Kevin Rose: Let’s jump into that. Now that we’ve covered Google, let’s jump into your personal life. Tim Ferriss: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to ask you for a counterpoint on a previous, I wouldn’t call it necessarily a prediction, but we talked about, I think it was in the last episode of The Random Show, a bit about venture capital. And I wouldn’t say that you said across the board, venture capital would be dead because there are capital intensive businesses that require — Kevin Rose: Yeah, hardware. Tim Ferriss: — hardware and build out and wet labs and all this stuff. But I’m wondering if I just put on my future vision goggles, which I wish I had, but let’s just pretend I do and I look forward, it doesn’t need to be five years. I look forward two years. And what you are describing is a reality, right? The barrier to entry, the hurdle is so low that suddenly from ideation to product takes a week. And there is an absolute glut, this just overwhelming tsunami of products. Now, on the positive side, yes, what would’ve cost people millions and millions of dollars to do 10 years ago, let’s say, 15 years ago, suddenly AWS and rentable infrastructure comes along, that cost goes down. Now AI comes along, cost further goes down. Kevin Rose: Sure. Tim Ferriss: But I imagine the war for attention is going to get so incredibly expensive. Do you think that products that get traction will nonetheless, if they don’t have the income stream to support it, raise venture capital purely for a marketing war chest and customer acquisition? I’m just wondering if you think you could make the argument that the customer acquisition costs are going to get, or user acquisition costs are going to get so high because everyone, you’re going to have a hundred X the number of bidders now who knows what the form will be. I don’t know if it’ll be Google AdWords, maybe it’ll be something else. What are your thoughts? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think, well, there’s a couple things there. The best products I’ve ever invested in, period, full stop, have been ones that don’t rely upon paid acquisition to grow. So, they have come up with something that is unique and novel enough to where word of mouth is their number one driver. That said, capital and deployed the right way and spent the right way around. Ad purchases is just fuel for the fire, which is great. And so, the thing VC is dead in the sense that the seed round was like, “Okay, I have a idea-ish. I’m going to go out and take $3 million and I’m going to give away 20 percent of my company.” What happens in the future is not that you don’t need that capital, because I think you’re right. You will need it for a variety of things. If you’re hitting insane scale, there will be moments where you need to put more warm bodies in seats to help you do all the things, and you may need to raise venture. But the difference is when you have product market fit, you go from raising and selling 20 percent of your business for $3 million to selling 20 percent of your business for $15 million, which is just fantastic for the entrepreneur. So, it’s not that venture is dead, it’s just that what we’re going to see is the entrepreneur is in control like they’ve never been before, which is fantastic. And if they say, “Okay, I’m off to the races and things are going so well, but guess what? I’m actually charging for my product and I’m breakeven.” You don’t ever have to raise VC. And then now you own a hundred percent of the business and you’re a Jason Fried, which we know is one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs of our time that invented SaaS that just has never taken any external investment. And you are just happy and you don’t report to anyone, which is a beautiful thing as well. Tim Ferriss: So, do you think it’s just like the killing fields for early stage folks and the value capture just gets pushed to later and later stage. Kevin Rose: Pushed out. Tim Ferriss: Right? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think that’s right. And I think largely on just tech, that is it’s understandable by AI. Meaning, if you’re running TypeScript or any of these languages that AI can figure out and write high quality code for, you just don’t need to raise capital. You can do it nights and weekends on your own. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Amazing. Okay. So, is it fair to say if you had to bet on one horse in the AI race that you would bet on Google? And then I have a follow-up question. Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: Well, now I know a little bit too much behind the scenes. If you had no stake in any companies, how would you please — Kevin Rose: Well, I never answer like that. I would always give you the true answer, even if I didn’t — Tim Ferriss: No, I know. I’ve got to say it, but yeah, where would you put first, second, third bet? Kevin Rose: Honestly, these valuations, I wouldn’t put a single dollar into the top three or five, largely because what are you going to do? Is Google going to 3X in the next 10 years? Tim Ferriss: Well, also, it remains to be seen how much AI cannibalizes their current money-printing machine in terms of search and sponsored ads and so on. Kevin Rose: I’m less worried about that because they own the largest distribution platform on Earth, which is Android. And so, they will find a way in there. And then also I think if Google had to pick their poison and say, “Okay, you can either base the future business off a $25 a month pro subscription to Gemini or a free account that is just ad-driven,” I think they’ll take that hybrid model all day long. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good point. Interesting. Okay, so you wouldn’t put any money into the big ones. So, do you choose then? Are you trying to find Amazon in 1998, 1999, right? Just in the absolute noise of — AI slop doesn’t just apply to Sora, it also applies to startups, right? There’s so much bullshit floating around. Some of it’s dressed up in very fancy clothing with fancy names, right? So, if you’re investing in AI writ large, how do you even — I mean, this is your job, right? Kevin Rose: I think there’s three buckets. I think there’s three buckets. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have to think about it. Kevin Rose: One is power. Without a doubt, we’re all going to need power. Small nuclear reactors are going to be a thing. The United States needs 3 to 5Xs power capacity in the next decade, if not more. And there is going to be a huge push into energy. So, there’s a bunch of plays there. You can look them up. There are even ETFs that track bundles of nuclear-related companies that are out there. That’s one play. I think power is without a doubt, the most important piece of this. And then data centers. There’s publicly traded data center companies out there. There are the bigs like Microsoft and Google and Amazon that are just expanding as fast as they possibly can and buying up land all over the United States. There’re always going to be a premium on that. They’re going to need that. NVIDIA, they’ve got competition from AMD, they’ve got competition from Google now. Obviously, they have such incredible tooling on the software side, there’s a lot of defensibility there. It’s a name to own. Would I buy in today at today’s prices? I don’t know. But I will say that if you think of this, less about, I’m just going to pick one horse and more like I’m going to pick a basket of things, these are the things that I would be putting into that basket. And then lastly, I would take large companies that have insane bloat from headcount that can be automated in the next, call it two to three years, where they will reduce sadly, and I hate to see this happen, but it’s going to happen no matter what. They’re going to reduce their headcount. They’re going to automate with AI and their profit margins are going to go through the roof. And I think those companies will reap the benefits of efficiency that comes from AI and their stock prices will as well. Tim Ferriss: How do you identify companies that have the most bloat with also the fewest hurdles to adopting AI for what you’re describing, right? Because some of them, they may be, who knows, just put in a position where from a process or regulatory perspective or whatever, they just can’t do it, at least in the near term. Kevin Rose: Yeah, in the near term, it’s listening to earnings calls and it is, I want to hear the CEO e saying that they are absolutely forcing their engineers to use AI forcing. You have to be, it is not optional at this point. To ask your engineers to play with it, you have to be using it every single day in your workflow. And the folks that are doing that, even though it’s not perfect today, they’re going to reap all the benefits 12 to 18 months from now. And so, that’s what I’m looking for more than anything else is who is wise enough? Because a lot of the CEOs are old. Who is wise enough to say it’s true, we know these folks and they just don’t — If you ask them the difference between Haiku 4, 5, and Sonnet, they would have no idea how to tell you. If they can’t answer those basic model related questions, what are you doing? So, it’s finding those people like the Jack Dorseys in the world and the folks that are just like — well, I wouldn’t want to say young because I want to be Asian, but they have to be leaning into this in a way that they have to believe that their entire business is going to be rebuilt from the ground up over the next, call it five years. And you have people like Salesforce, CEOs doing that. Obviously, Benioff’s on board with this. There’s a handful of folks that have said, “We are making sure this is a mandate from the top down.” Google did this quite well where they had this red alarm, or thing that they called off probably three years ago, where it said it is all hands on deck AI and Apple did not do that. And now look what’s happening. Most likely, Apple’s going to end up licensing Gemini from Google. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Wild world out there, kids. Wild world. Kevin Rose: Yeah. It’s a fun time to be alive, man. It’s fun to be playing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. Let’s see. I figure I could give people some maybe holiday gift ideas just in case they’re — Kevin Rose: Oh, yes, I’ve got some great ones. First thing I can recommend, something you can fit in your pocket. So, this right here looks like a golf ball with little, not quite spikes, but studs on it. They’re flattened. This is called a Rubz ball, R-U-B-Z, and I travel with this. You just roll out your feet on this before you go to bed and I have felt this helped everything from relaxing and just winding down. What I have noticed, and this is something I spoke with Ed Coan about a hundred years ago, long time ago. He’s the greatest powerlifter of all time, phenomenal athlete and very nice guy. But basically if you address your feet, sometimes you feel it all the way up the kinetic chain, your forelegs, knees, even your low back can sometimes release. So this, I think it cost less than 10 bucks. This is a Rubz ball. You can buy it on Amazon anywhere else. That’s a very easy one. That’s just pocket sized. We can go back and forth. What have you got? What you — Kevin Rose: Yeah, let’s do it. Okay, so this one is awesome, dude. You have my doc that I sent you right with the links to everything? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I do. Kevin Rose: I don’t know if you have it up in front of you. So, if you click on the second one down these bonsai Nanoblocks. So, I’ve been talking about Nanoblocks for a while. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you are. Kevin Rose: Hear me out, dude. This is a fun stocking stuffer. People are going to love this shit. So, it’s $38. It’s these little baby bonsai trees. Nanoblocks are like LEGOs, but they’re like one 10th of the size. So, you need tweezers to assemble them. It is oddly satisfying to build these little tiny bonsai trees. You get all six of them for $38 and if you use the code, Tim — no, there’s no code, but they’re amazing. They’re so fun. Anyway, Nanoblocks are awesome. This is a little fun little pack, great stocking stuffer. They’re super tiny and they’re cute. Look, there’s Nanoblocks up there behind me. See that beautiful tree? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. There it is. So you recommended a book to me. Do you want to mention it? It’s last in your list. I bought the audiobook and I listened to it on my flights recently. I thought the narrator was really, really good also. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s called Stop Fixing Yourself: Wake Up, All Is Well. It’s by Anthony De Mello, who we were talking about the Jesuit priest and therapist that we talked about earlier. Tim, we had both somehow discovered this book originally. Not this book, but the other one we’re talking about. Tim Ferriss: Awareness. Kevin Rose: Awareness. And it was really cool to hear that you were into it because it was one of my favorite books that we did not compare notes and we read this independently. I don’t know how the hell that happened, but we both loved it. And this is another one where I was just like, “This is so good because there’s so many core truths here that apply to my practice on the meditation side and I just loved it.” But it does require a little bit of understanding. It’s not like someone from off the street can totally read this and be like, “Oh, that makes a ton of sense to me.” I don’t know if you felt that way. Tim Ferriss: I feel like, well, there are two things I would say. Just having read a lot of Anthony De Mello that I think Awareness, subtitle, Conversations with the Masters, it used to be The Perils and Promise of Reality, but they changed the subtitle. I preferred the old one, but Awareness by Anthony De Mello. His last name is two words, D-E M-E-L-L-O is 184 pages and I’ve gifted it to at least 50 people. I mean, I have an entire bookshelf full of this book in my guest bedroom at my house just to give friends. Kevin Rose: Yeah, same, dude. It’s so funny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I would recommend people read Awareness first. I don’t think you need anything special in terms of background for that. Kevin Rose: Well, you do need one thing. You need to know that it is a lecture, so it reads like a lecture. It doesn’t read like a book. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which I like, which I like and he’s very no-nonsense. Kevin Rose: I gave it to a couple of friends and they started reading it and they’re like, “Wait, is this a talk that he gave?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, yeah, I should have told you that. It’s an actual talk.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a collection of polished lectures that he gave. So, Awareness would be the first. And then in the case of the Stop Fixing Yourself, I really enjoyed it. There’s a lot of overlap with Awareness. So, there are certain points that get reiterated. The audiobook rendition of Stop Fixing Yourself is very, very good. I disagree with some of the conclusions which are effectively along the lines — I shouldn’t say, this might sound unfair, but in the conclusion, he talks about how ultimate freedom is not depending on anyone for anything and you could be perfectly happy in isolation by yourself. And I was like, “Evolutionarily. I think that’s actually a pretty hard sell.” But what I would suggest is if you listen to or read these books, as with any book, expect that you’re going to disagree with and maybe even discard 10 percent, 20 percent of it, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. These are really, really helpful books. Kevin Rose: Well said. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, let me grab another one here. I’ll recommend two others in case people are interested in books. So, fiction, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. I think it might just be Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Anyway, it’s tomorrow three times by Gabrielle Zevin, Z-E-V-I-N. It’s a fiction book and it was on the New York Times’ list of the hundred best books of the 21st century. It’s a new one and it is all about entrepreneurship and game design and love unrequited. And when I recommended this book initially in 5-Bullet Friday, my newsletter, one of my attorneys who helped craft the agreement for Coyote, another stocking stuffer, the card game that I made which is 20 — Kevin Rose: Yeah, I know this is on a Black Friday sale, by the way, it’s 38 percent off on Amazon right now or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s 7.99 right now. It’s doing super well there. The reviews are great. It’s like 4.7 or 4.8 stars. Kevin Rose: Man, I’m so proud of you, dude. This is so cool to see you having success here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thanks man. Kevin Rose: I thought you were going to do The 5-Hour Body and I was like, “Ah, you probably shouldn’t go there,” and it’s nice to see you doing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, it’s been super fun. But my attorney, who helped with the negotiations on deal structuring for Coyote, specializes in video games and he’s been involved with some epic deals and amazing mergers and acquisitions and all this crazy stuff. And he texted me after I put that in the newsletter and he said, “That book is so good. It was eerie because it is so accurate down to the finest detail that it felt like somebody was looking over my shoulder when I was doing these deals.” That is how well researched this book is. You would love it. I really think you would enjoy it. Kevin Rose: My old assistant, Sarah, who’s amazing, she gifted it to me and it burned in the fire when my house burned down. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ve got to read it. Kevin Rose: But I need to get it because she was like, “You’ve got to listen to this book.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah, it’s great. And then the last one I’ll recommend just because we gave some nonfiction, then just gave fiction. I’ll give poetry, which people might not expect, but it’s a little tiny compilation. This also has an entire shelf in my guest room. It’s called Gold, it’s by Rumi. And then the translator, Haleh Liza Gafori, last name G-A-F-O-R-I, 112 pages. And it is just an incredible collection of poetry, of course, originally by the great Persian mystic Rumi, but with incredible new translations by Haleh Liza Gafori, who is an American poet of Persian descent. So, she’s a native speaker and also, she herself a poet and musician. So, if you read one or two of these poems before you go to bed at night, it just makes everything better. So I would also just recommend. I can keep going with gift recommendations, but I suspect you have more. I would like to mention anymore. Kevin Rose: Oh, I’ve got some great ones, dude. Yeah, absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t we do two at a time? Why don’t you do two and then I’ll do another two. Kevin Rose: Okay. I’m going to make you a multi-billionaire from how many people buy this next one, I’m going to say with your Amazon affiliate link. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: This right here, my friend, is the best purchase I’ve ever made in my life. Tim Ferriss: Whoa, that’s a strong statement. Kevin Rose: Okay, maybe not, but it’s high up there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, okay. Kevin Rose: Have you ever been in one of those situations where you need a small, little screwdriver or a screw head and you can’t find the right one that fits? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: This is 25 different micro, everything from hex nuts to screwdrivers to flatheads, and it’s a magnetic little insert into the actual one. Now you think, okay, who cares? But it’s $7.79 and it acts like a $25 screwdriver. It is the best stocking stuffer in the world. Once a year or twice a year you’ll get something where it takes two double As or whatever, and there’s a little, tiny screwdriver thing you’ve got to undo. Tim Ferriss: Totally. Kevin Rose: Where am I going to find something that fits that? This is that thing. And then when you want to tweak your glasses or whatever, you need those micro screwdrivers. Dude, $7, this thing rocks. It’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: How did you find this thing? Kevin Rose: It had good reviews on Amazon. I bought it and when I got it, I was like, they should be charging three times as much for this thing. The torque doesn’t actually ruin the bit heads, which is great because oftentimes with the cheaper ones, the bit heads get ruined. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: Anyway. You have to have it in every junk drawer in your house. It’s one of those things. But I love these things. Back in the day, when you were doing 5-Bullet Friday where you wanted me to contribute stuff, you would say, “Hey, what’s the best thing under $50, or whatever, that you love?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. This is it. Kevin Rose: This is one of those things that’s under $10 that is absolutely worth every penny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love it. All right. So under $10, I don’t know if it’s $10, might be a little bit more, but in addition to the Rubz ball, I’ll just give a couple of quickfire. There’s something called the Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. It was actually introduced to me by Nsima Inyang, or Inyang, I think is how he pronounces it, but you sent me his video, so you are responsible — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — for me ultimately connecting with him. But this Alpha Ball for rolling out your hips, for traveling with, it’s about the size of a softball, but it’s just the perfect density and texture, you can get everywhere you need to get, which you cannot do with a foam roller, nor is it easy to travel with a foam roller. I just love this thing. I use it pretty much every day. So, that’s the two — Kevin Rose: I didn’t see it on video. Did you hold it up? Tim Ferriss: No, I have it downstairs in my suitcase actually. But the — Kevin Rose: Okay, let me look it up. What’s it called again? Tim Ferriss: Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. You can find it on Amazon. It’s 19.99, more than worth every penny. I can send you a link to it, of course. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: Then other things I’ll throw in there, this is going to be one of those things. This is my version of your little TED talk that you just gave on the — Kevin Rose: Screwdrivers. Tim Ferriss: — $7 screwdrivers where people are like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” This is my version of that, which is the — I don’t know how to pronounce this, Maestri, M-A-E-S-T-R-I. Maestri House rechargeable milk frother. All right. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know. Right? Kevin Rose: Mine was better than that, but — Tim Ferriss: Hold on — Kevin Rose: Keep going. Tim Ferriss: — hold on, hold on. I have owned so many of these frothers for coffee, for tea, for whatever, protein shakes or whatever, these little hand frothers. They always — Kevin Rose: They all break. They all suck, dude. Tim Ferriss: They all break, or the batteries die and then you can’t recharge it, or it’s — Kevin Rose: Yes. Tim Ferriss: — like an outboard motor and you’re like, oh, let me just do this for my tea and relax, and it shoots liquid all over the place. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: There’s so many issues. This thing is like the Lamborghini of milk frothers. It costs — Kevin Rose: Ooh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It costs how much? 30 bucks. It’s not that crazy. Kevin Rose: It’s USB-C 2 charging. That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It’s USB-C. You basically turn the very top of it to adjust in any increment you want the intensity of the agitation. I have to tell you, I asked somebody on my team to just do diligence and get me a frother that would solve all these problems that I mentioned. He knows how to do a lot of research and this was his conclusion, and I got it and I was like, “Where has this been all my life? Oh, my God.” Has almost 3,000 reviews, or 2,600 reviews, 4.5 stars. This thing is just amazing. I use it every day. That’s one. When I put this in 5-Bullet Friday, what I wrote was, “It reminds me of Sage Wisdom from Kevin Kelly,” who is the founding editor of — Kevin Rose: Oh, I love Kevin Kelly. Tim Ferriss: — Wired magazine. Amazing guy. Kevin Rose: Yeah. We did a walk with him together. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. He had, at that time, I think it was a draft of a book that he put together, this tiny book called Excellent Advice for Living, which are these pithy little quotes from Kevin that he used to put in his — I think they were his birthday letters to friends where he’d be like, “Here are the 10 things I learned this year.” One of his pieces of advice is, “Take note if you find yourself wondering where is my good knife or where is my good pen. That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.” I have shelves full of shitty frothers that have been sent to me or that I’ve bought and they’re just terrible, so I just got rid of all of them and replaced them with this thing. Kevin Rose: That’s so awesome. Tim Ferriss: Other things, real quick: microphone. I got this microphone for travel called the Elgato, one word. Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, I love Elgato. Tim Ferriss: Elgato Wave:3. It is a gorgeous piece of design. It makes me think of Braun design back in the day, B-R-A-U-N, and it actually solves, somehow, bounce and echo better than even this fancy mic, this Shure mic that I’m speaking into right now. It is really impressive. I don’t know what they do with the firmware, software, whoever the hell designs these types of things, but this has become my favorite travel mic, is the Elgato Wave:3. Also, not that expensive. Kevin Rose: Have you seen their prompter by the way? They make a tiny, little prompter — Tim Ferriss: I haven’t seen it. Kevin Rose: — if you want to read scripts or anything like that. Oh, Elgato makes this beautiful, little prompt you can control with an iPhone or an iPad. For people that are doing monologues and podcasts and stuff like that, Elgato is some great gear and it’s not that expensive. It’s well priced. Tim Ferriss: This one, the Wave:3 — I’ll check out the prompter — it’s got almost 10,000 reviews, 4.7 stars, 150 bucks. I rely on it to the extent that I’m professional, a professional loves recording. There’s a lot more I could jump into. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give one that is expensive, but the best of breed, which is the TANK M3 push sled. This is a sled. It’s literally sitting right outside my door, about 100 feet away. I have tried so many different sleds for resolving back pain, for building all posterior chain development and strength, glute activation, you name it. Pushing and pulling a sled just gives you so many dividends. KneesOverToesGuy also talks about this at length, but the TANK M3 push sled is — Kevin Rose: Holy shit, it’s pricey. Tim Ferriss: — bar none the best sled I’ve ever used. Yeah. How much is it? Did you just pull it up? Kevin Rose: 1,500 on Amazon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 1,500. Yeah, 1,500 bucks. I would not — Kevin Rose: It looks amazing though. Tim Ferriss: I would not trade it. You can easily rotate it. It has mechanical resistance. For instance, I’m pushing it in a gravel driveway. It’s not just skids. You can use this on turf, you can use this on carpets, you can use it indoors without destroying the floor. It’s just an amazing sled. If people are looking for best of the best, in my opinion, and versatility, that’s one. And then if you don’t want more stuff or you want to give something to friends or family who don’t need more physical things — I am talking my book a little bit here because I’m involved with the company, but The Way App. It’s so easy, right? Kevin Rose: Henry’s the best, man. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to be doing hopefully another retreat in-person together. It started out as just my hand-down favorite meditation app. It’s the easiest way to get back in the habit. I just used it yesterday morning and this morning. I tend to do 10-minute sessions and then sometimes do an extra 10 minutes of TM or something after the fact. I think you can get 30 sessions for free with no credit card required — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — to try it out. And then if you want to give an annual membership, that’s 100 bucks. You can just download the app for free and then tap My Way and share it with people that way with a gift button. Kevin Rose: I’ll definitely add onto that. And I’ll say that I met Henry, the creator of The Way App, and he’s one of the very few Zen masters that are fully accredited in the United States. It is such a treat to interact with and have Henry as a guide and you get a pocket Zen master. I don’t want to sell this, but I will say that in the last — I started training with him in terms of meeting with him over Zoom during COVID, and now it’s been a few years, there is no better money spent in terms of — for me it has been more of retreats and things like that that I’ve been to of his. But meditation in terms of my just general anxiety and general way of moving through life, it’s been a game changer. It’s been a game changer. And Henry, I will give him a ton of credit there. One of the things that he told me early on, it still hits me today, is, “It’s not about, ‘Can I put in an hour a day of meditation?’ It’s better to put in just 10 minutes a day or five minutes a day and do it consistently than it is to try and achieve the mountaintop and go all out.” Can you just show up consistently? And I think if you do it for the first 30 days, you’ll feel it. You’ll feel it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ll notice something much earlier, in my experience. Henry has this expression, I’m going to paraphrase it, but basically if you do the practice, even if in some sessions you’re like, my mind is all over the place, I feel like that was a waste of time, “If you walk consistently in the fog, you can’t help but get wet.” is one of his expressions, meaning it compounds over time and even if you feel like individual sessions aren’t doing much, it does actually compound. If people want to keep it simple, you can find a QR code at thewayapp.com/tim and that’ll give you 30 free sessions with no credit card, so people can check that out if they want. What else do we have, Kevin? You have — Kevin Rose: I’ve got one more that’s fun. It is on the slightly pricier side. It’s a little over $200, close to $300. Actually, it’s a walking treadmill. My wife, Darya, turned me onto this. It is a very thin, tiny, little walking treadmill that has phenomenal reviews. You just throw it underneath your desk and for under $300 you can set the incline to 10 and it’s all with a little, tiny remote control. There’s nothing to hold onto, because you have your desk. You can just work and it rolls away because it only weighs 50 pounds, and you can just stash it in the corner. I think it’s the best walking treadmill. We did a bunch of research and it’s the best one under $300. Great way to get some exercise in there. Throw on a weighted vest there and you’re in a really good place. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, that’ll be plenty. I saw that when Darya was showing me her office. I was like, oh, look at that. There it is. Kevin Rose: That’s right. You got the tour. I wasn’t even home and you came over and stole my sleeping meds and — Tim Ferriss: Snagged your Belsomra — Kevin Rose: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: — took a spin on the walking treadmill and then took off. Yeah, I still owe you a trade for that. I do see in your notes, do you want to take a second and run people through Kevin’s current AI stack? This is all Greek to me, I don’t even understand what half of this means. Kevin Rose: Okay, real quick. I don’t know if you want to touch on New Year’s resolutions really fast — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s do it after the AI stack. Kevin Rose: AI Stack, one of the things that I’ve noticed is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the space is this idea of an AI assistant that is not your phone, but something that you can call when you need to remember something, when you need to take notes, when you — Tim, I was wearing that little pendant when you and I got together. Tim Ferriss: Hate it, hate it. Kevin Rose: It’s always recording, and Tim goes to me, he is like, “It’s always recording?” I was like, “Yeah.” And he goes, “I hate to ask you this, but can you just take it off? It’s too much anxiety for me.” So I had to take off that pendant and put it in my bag. But I agree with you, in that it is weird. It does cripple our conversations in our honesty when you know there’s something that’s listening all the time, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100 percent. Kevin Rose: A couple things, Nothing, the Android phone company, I’m not an investor or anything like that, they make headphones, which I’m wearing right now for this podcast. But one of the things that was really cool, when they released these headphones a month ago, they have a little talk button on the headphones. If you hold down talk as you’re holding your headphones case, I can record anything and it goes into their AI and it creates to-do lists for me, notes — Tim Ferriss: That’s cool. Kevin Rose: — whatever it may be. Tim Ferriss: That’s a cool feature. Kevin Rose: It’s just fun. Yeah. There was a company called Sandbar and we invested. True, it wasn’t my deal. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. Do you need to have an Android phone to use those? Kevin Rose: Yes, you need to have a Nothing phone. Tim Ferriss: Bummer. Kevin Rose: That’s the problem. But the idea is sound in that it’s not always on, it’s just when you need it, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep, yep. Kevin Rose: One of the things that Sandbar did, and I have one of their prototype rings around here somewhere. One of the things that Sandbar did is they created a ring, almost like an Oura ring, where if you just lightly touch it, you can whisper to any notes that you might want and it saves it in the AI cloud on your phone, Android OS, whatever. If you have headphones in, it’ll respond back to you. So like, “Hey. Remind me, what’s that meeting I have tomorrow?” just quietly. It doesn’t listen to the entire room, and then it gives you that data back in your headphones. Anyway. Sandbar is not out yet. It’s coming out middle of next year. I highly recommend sandbar.com, checking out. Like I said, it is something that we invest in at the fund level, but it’s not my deal. But I will say, I like where this is going. Even if it’s not Sandbar, something like this that is a little companion, that is not your big ass phone, that can be engaged with when you want to jot something down is quite cool. Outside of that, I would say AI on the Notion front has been quite good. The agents that they’ve added inside of Notion are phenomenal and that continues to get better. Tim Ferriss: What do you use that for? How do you use that? Kevin Rose: Notion, just added note-taking now. If you’re in a Zoom or any type of video call, it will automatically prompt you to record the entire thing. By default, I always say to people, Notion’s not actually recording the audio, but they are transcribing it, and they put the meeting notes and the bullet points into my Notion for me, and then I can ask questions of that transcript later on. Call it a week or two later, I’m like, “Hey, Tim mentioned some really cool book by Anthony de Mello, which one was it?” and it would, boom, right there, it’s within two seconds. That’s really cool. And then you can ask questions of your entire corpus of data. So, if you’re storing a bunch of stuff in there — I had my EIN number for one of my LCs and I’d be like, “Hey, what’s the EIN number for this LC?” Two seconds later, it’s out. That’s fun. Tim Ferriss: When do you think Gemini built into G Suite will be good enough to do that for an inbox? Kevin Rose: It is now. It is now. Tim Ferriss: Is it? Kevin Rose: Yeah, it is. Tim Ferriss: Because it was so disappointing as of even a few weeks ago. Kevin Rose: I just enabled it, this deeper integration. I don’t know if I’m a beta tester, but they let me in, and it does exactly what I just said. It’s within the coming weeks if I’ve happened to be on some beta list and whatever. Who will do this right now is actually the Gemini — oh, what are they calling it? It’s their AI suite where you can drop documents into it and everything. Everyone’s screaming it right at me. You know what I’m talking about, right? Have you played with this? Tim Ferriss: No, no. Oh, wait, are you talking about NotebookLM? No. Kevin Rose: Yeah, NotebookLM. Yeah, NotebookLM is getting better and better. Here’s a fun hack. This is a great one for your audience because they like your productivity, everything. One thing that’s really fun is, imagine there’s something you want to learn that’s new. Insert anything. You want to learn how to do basic Pilates. Go to ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever else and say, “Hey, give me a deep research guide on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and then you hit go. You wait five minutes, whatever, it gives you back a whole script. You copy that, paste it into NotebookLM, and say, “Create me a five-minute podcast on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and you have an instant podcast primer on that thing. I use that for coding technologies. I’ve used that for quantum computing. Tim, do you know how quantum computing works? Do you know how gates fold on each other when — Tim Ferriss: No. Kevin Rose: I didn’t. I dropped that in there and then you say, “Explain it like I’m five in a podcast.” Or not five, but you’d say, “Explain it like I’m a — Tim Ferriss: Fifth grader. Kevin Rose: — freshman in college.” Yeah, like I’m a fifth grader, whatever. I have aphantasia and I have no way to recall this later. It gives you this great, little podcast and it’s a fun, little way to learn anything new on the go. Tim Ferriss: I have to give a plug, and I am an investor in this company. It came up in a group thread. I don’t think he would mind me mentioning this. Our mutual friend, Chris Sacca, was like, “My daughter just taught herself about stock trading,” and this, this, and this. He took a screenshot and he’s like, “She created her own curriculum,” and — It was from a startup called Oboe. If people go to Oboe, that’s O-B-O-E.fyi, so oboe.fyi, it just says, “What do you want to learn about? We’ll make you a course.” You literally just type it out and it gives you everything in one place. Kevin Rose: Are you an investor in this? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m an investor. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: I noticed you had mentioned before — what was it? This would be fun for 30 seconds. When you were pitched this, because you were very — you say no to a lot of things, which is great, as every — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: — investor should. What was it about this that really hooked you in? Tim Ferriss: There were a few things. It was the people involved. I had some familiarity with the people involved and I had confidence in their ability to execute. Also, this is what I do, right? In the sense that if I have tried to hone any single skill, it is deconstructing and simplifying complex subjects, then putting material in some type of logical sequence, doing 80/20 analysis on the 20 percent of material that makes the difference, and the material beats method a lot of the time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I’ve thought a lot about this and I was like, all right, the thesis and mission of the company makes a lot of sense to me. Will they be the winner? I have no idea. That is a much harder question. That informs bet sizing and things along those lines. But I have a lot of confidence in the founders. The company itself was introduced to me, or the founding team behind it, by another founder who’s had exits, who is an investor, who’s a friend of mine. And I thought to myself, even if this just goes towards creating a product that I, myself will use — which is really where I start with a lot of my investing. Sometimes I succeed when I stray from that, but my hit rate is a lot higher when — say, in the case of Uber or Shopify or any of these other — Kevin Rose: Yes, it’s a core competence of yours. Tim Ferriss: Duolingo, these are — I know at least I am a market of one — Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: — for all of these products, and Oboe would fall in that category. That’s how I decided to invest. With these companies, it’s also not a bet-the-farm scenario, at least not for me. It’s you’re creating a portfolio with the recognition that 70, 80 percent of your investments are going to go to zero. But I try to answer the question, how can I win even if this goes to zero? How can I win? It’s if I help to in some way support a product and the development of a product that I use myself to learn a bunch of stuff quickly, then given the leverage that I think I can create or find in the world, it’s like, wow. If I have a smooth way, an elegant way to learn more about a few different — I’ll give you an example. If I’m considering, and I’ve already done this, if I’m doing due diligence on a company that I can’t talk about right now, but it’s innovating in biotech, and I want to learn as much as possible about different types of mRNA therapeutics, I’m not coming from a background that enables me to do that. If I then am able to do due diligence a hundred times faster because I’m not sending out 15 emails to people I think might be able to assist, and I’d still do that level of due diligence, but if let’s just say that 50 K investment allows me to then do due diligence in a way that allows me to place two or three other bets more effectively, I’ve very likely made my money back. Whether it’s with investing or choosing projects like the card game, Coyote, or anything else, my fundamental, underlying question is: Can this be a win even if it fails with, let’s just say, the primary external metric of sales or exit or whatever it might be? If I’m developing skills and relationships that snowball and transcend any single project, then that’s a vote in favor of doing something. oboe.fyi would fit into that bucket for me. It made me so happy to see Sacca’s daughter when she’s whatever, 12 or 13, creating her own course. I was like, okay, that’s a good sign that makes me happy. Kevin Rose: I just clicked on one of the things to create a course for me. It’s pretty cool because right away it said, “Do you want this in podcast format, which is seven minutes?” or, “Do you want this in lectured recording, which is 20 minutes?” Tim Ferriss: That’s awesome. Kevin Rose: That’s built into the product from step one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, from step one. And like you said, this is the blocky, brick, Motorola version. The rate of iteration for something like this is going to be so extreme, it’s going to be head spinning, so we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: I’m excited about it. Kevin Rose: All right, the moment you all have been waiting for, Tim’s girlfriend. Tim Ferriss: Thought I — Kevin Rose: Come on, dude. Tim Ferriss: Thought I got out of — Kevin Rose: No, no, no. People are — Tim Ferriss: I — Kevin Rose: They want to know what’s up with Tim’s personal life. Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to dox anyone who doesn’t opt into being doxed, so I’ll skip any identifying particulars. It’s getting serious quickly. She’s incredibly — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — sweet, incredibly self-aware, intelligent. For people who are wondering, of all places, met on Hinge. Have to kiss a lot of frogs or go on a lot of dates, it’s a lot of reps, a lot of swiping and a lot of noise to get to that point. But it did work. Kevin Rose: What was the first date like? Tim Ferriss: First date was Greek food, very chill, felt very much — I pay a lot of attention to this. You know that I have a very sensitive nervous system, and I just immediately felt down-regulated and at ease with her. That’s a lot. That’s not a small thing for me. Keeps me on my toes, is very funny, is very good at calling me on my bullshit. I’m optimistic. We’ll see. We’ll see. Super, super happy. Doing Thanksgiving together and — Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Family introduction time and all that shit? Tim Ferriss: Oh, she met my family already quite a while ago. It’s — Kevin Rose: I’ve only met her once. One final question then I’ll let you out the hot box. What is the hardest thing for you at this stage? Because you get to this point where there’s this honeymoon phase and then all of a sudden that starts to peel off and it’s in the nitty-gritty of life. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: What’s the hardest, most challenging part about this next, call it, six months? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know if I have the ability to predict, but my guess would be — I think what I’m about to describe is a plight of modern dating in general, at least as I’ve seen it among my friends and pretty much anyone who I’ve ever spoken to about this or if I ever mention modern datings in the app-based dating world. It’s such a game of roulette. The apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. I think the challenge for almost anyone who has been part of that playing field is when things get hard, when things are hard, when you have friction that lasts more than a day or a week, to stay the course and do the work necessary to resolve that as opposed to just being like, ah, fuck this, I’m just going to go back to the well. Kevin Rose: Because the well’s right there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: It’s 20 seconds away and a swipe away, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: That’s the downfall of these whole things. It’s so easy to move on to the next thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. They are all designed to be, of course, as addictive as possible. And even though they might say they’re designed to be deleted, by definition, since they have a fiduciary responsibility, a legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, their business model is entirely dependent on recurring revenue. So, they’re designed to keep you using the app as long as humanly possible. I don’t blame them for that. That’s just the way that this ecosystem works. But it is something to be aware of because they are seductive and they’re designed to be seductive, these apps, in every way conceivable. I would say that, step number one, take that stuff off your phone. And then number two is, fortunately I feel like over my last few long relationships — I’ve had some very long relationships. Five, six years in two cases — that I’ve developed a toolkit. I can always use more work and more refinement, but it’s like, do you have the basics of something approximating Nonviolent Communication? Do you ask for what you want and do you tell someone if they’re doing something that you don’t want? These seem like very obvious, self-evident things you should do, but a lot of people struggle with both of those, and then that breeds resentment or people bottle things up and then they explode and they say things they can’t take back. To what extent have you tried to mitigate those things? Do you have a toolkit? There are very good books out there, very good workshops. I’ve read a lot of these books and I’ve gone to a lot of workshops. As much as I’ve felt like I wanted to poke my eyes out with bicycle spokes at points in these workshops and seminars because I can only take so much of it — Kevin Rose: Same. Tim Ferriss: — they do help though. It could be something really small. And there are things you learn along the way, at least I have, as you get older, which is you can have almost anything you want in life if you discuss it openly and early. If you have weaknesses, if you have requests, if you have needs, if you have things that you value that are maybe weirdly out of proportion to most people, just talking about that stuff early sets the stage for success or at least communication. Very early on in this relationship, having conversations about conversations, if that makes sense, having open communication about how we’d like to communicate the challenges we have with communication. How we’re going to communicate, biasing towards honesty and being direct, even if you need to do a little bit of cleanup afterwards, has just saved a lot of brand damage. In this case, I think we both have very growth-oriented mindsets. I think both of us are pretty good at taking feedback. There are times when you’re just too sleep deprived or pissed off or bitchy or irritable, and you’re not good at taking feedback. You’re always going to have those days. But overall, I think we’re both eager to improve and we’re good at giving feedback in a way that generally doesn’t come off as too holier than now, judgmental. We’ll see, we’ll see. But in terms of the challenges, I think the challenges are always — I shouldn’t say always, that’s a big word. Man, so much of it just comes down to communication. Do you have the tools? Have you, say, read or listened to Terry Real? Have you both listened or read Terry Real so that you have some scripts or some shared language that you can use as shorthand? And — Kevin Rose: The problem I have with Terry Real is that if it’s taken too literally, it can sound formulaic. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: I don’t want to do the formula, let’s just talk, it can be a bit — Tim Ferriss: Here’s what I would say about that. I’d say that almost anything that works repeatedly is a formula. In the beginning, I think it’s important, as rote as it might seem, to — let’s just say the book, Nonviolent Communication, I think it’s Marshall Rosenberg, it’s a great book, but after a while you’re like, oh, my God, am I really going to say again, “When you did X, as a video camera would’ve recorded it, I felt Y. And the story I make up is X.” Kevin Rose: That stuff. “The story I make up…” kills me. Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. I know it kills you and — Kevin Rose: Stop saying, “The story I make up…” Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. As much as you might hate it, what you would hate more is, “Kevin, I fucking hate when you do X. It makes me feel Y, because you always do Z.” That’s worse, I think, right? You might be like — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — ah, with the formula, but the amount of damage you can do when you veer completely away from it is a lot. And then once you have the, I’d say, basic mastery or fluency with the formula, then you can deviate, right? Kevin Rose: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: Then you can start to deviate. But for instance, Terry, as any couples therapist, has certain frameworks and formulas. But there are also underlying philosophical principles that I think apply to a million different things that are outside of formulas. I’ll give you an example. One thing that Terry says — I think this is in Fierce Intimacy, which is an audio book, you can’t find a print version of it. I highly recommend it to folks. The point he makes is — it’s real simple — objective reality has no place in a relationship. What the hell does that mean? What that means is if you’re out at dinner and then the waiter comes over and the wife orders and then the waiter walks away and the husband’s like, “Honey, you don’t need to yell at him,” and she’s like, “I wasn’t yelling,” and then it turns into a whole bullshit argument about whether she was yelling or not. If the husband were to say, “Honey, actually I hired a professional audiologist with the latest cutting-edge technology and recording equipment, and they’re sitting right at the table next to us. If we accept the commonly defined threshold for yelling at XYZ decimals, if you look at these numbers, you can see that in fact you were, by scientific definition, yelling,” is that going to fix the problem? No, it’s going to be a huge fucking mess, right? Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: His point is the stories matter and the subjective matters and very — shorthand for that is objective — he may not word it exactly this way, but objective reality just doesn’t have a place in, let’s just say, an argument. We’re going to make mistakes. Occasionally, especially someone like me is going to try to appeal to some objective measure of God knows what. But if you can just postpone that judgment even for a minute or two, it just makes a world of difference, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Maybe it makes me sound like I’m really remedial in the EQ communication department. I actually don’t think that’s true. I think I’m pretty good. It’s like going to the gym, it’s like playing pool or shooting archery or whatever, it’s not a one-and-done thing, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you don’t practice these things, you will revert to whatever your parents did. Period. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I don’t want to model that. That was a goddamn mess. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I found that if my partner gets upset, just sitting down and saying, “Calm down.” is huge. Tim Ferriss: That works — Kevin Rose: It just works every time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kevin Rose: Or, “You’re being like your mother.” Those are things that are just really just home runs. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. “Why are you so hysterical like your mother?” Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Works like a charm. I think that’s Terry Real’s second principle. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Just say “calm down” and then you’re good, you’re good. They’ll be like, “Oh, I was being so crazy. You’re right. I should just calm down.” Tim Ferriss: I think also just expecting there to be bumps. There are always going to be bumps and — we’ll see, we’ll see. But — Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s been great so far. I feel super, super lucky, really, really fortunate. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I mean, you only date supermodels, so you should feel lucky. Tim Ferriss: That’s not true. That’s not true. Kevin Rose: I’ve met her. You have a supermodel on your hands. She’s great. Tim Ferriss: She’s very pretty, but she’s also very, very smart, knows how to adult, knows how to take care of things in the world. Which isn’t asking too much, but it’s surprising how many aspiring stay-at-home girlfriends you can find out there who have no intention of operating in the world. I feel very, very lucky, super, super fortunate. Kevin Rose: I’m excited for you, dude. Tim Ferriss: Yeah — Kevin Rose: Can we just spend some more time with her? Our first interactions were great. I’m excited to get to know her better. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, she’s incredibly kind, not a malicious bone in her body, but at the same time, hilariously blunt in some cases and sometimes not so hilariously blunt, but I’ll take it. It’s a package deal, I’ll take it. Kevin Rose: You’ve got a bit of that too though, right? So, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: I’ve got some of that. Yeah, I do too. I’ve got some of that, for sure. Kevin Rose: I’ve known enough of your ex-girlfriends to know that you’ve got a little bit of that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve got a little bit of that. It’s true. Oh, man. I think I’ve probably checked the box of talking about the girlfriend. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to have dinner very shortly. Happy Thanksgiving, man. Kevin Rose: Yeah, happy Thanksgiving. I would say the only thing on my side, just to bring people to speed on, is I have a new tech podcast that I’m very excited about that I’m going to launch in the new year. Kevinrose.com for my 4-Bullet Friday, which is a much faster read. No, I don’t — I only put out one email every month and a half or every — but it’s always packed with the latest AI stuff I’m playing with, all that stuff. Anyway. That’s my only plug of the show, is kevinrose.com, for the newsletter. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, check it out. Check it out, folks. We’ll hit New Year’s resolutions and stuff next time we do a Random Show. Let’s do it. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We’ll do that, because I need to dust mine off and blow the film that has settled on those and look at them in higher resolution, so I could use a little extra time. And we’ll — Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: We’ll get after it. Kevin Rose: Love you, brother. Always good to see you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love you too, bud. Kevin Rose: And thanks for sharing more of the personal side with us. Everybody gets a kick out of that and it’s always fun to hear your adventures. But I’m excited for you marching forward and I have good vibes about this one. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. It’s a fucking jungle out there. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Modern dating, it is simultaneously so fun if you hit your groove in a playing-the-field kind of way, but it’s also so incredibly exhausting and frustrating and can be very demoralizing. And — Kevin Rose: I don’t feel bad for you, honestly. I’ve gotten some of your texts. I think you had a damn good run. You had a good run. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m not complaining. I’m just saying I feel most at home, at ease, at peace when I am with my current girlfriend. It’s qualitatively a world of difference from just running around like some horny bastard with his hair on fire. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but — Kevin Rose: Not that there’s any hair left, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: Not that there’s any hair left. And also just be aware, whether you’re on X or Instagram, but especially on the dating apps because it is selling sex and things that are hardwired to hijack your attention, your faculties are being exploited to the maximum degree possible. It’s just something to be aware of. Really check your state before and after using these things to determine how much you might want to use them or if you want to put safeguards around how long you spend on these things. All right. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: Cool, brother. Love you very much. Please give a hug to Darya and the girls for me. Kevin Rose: Will do. Tim Ferriss: And — Kevin Rose: Same on my side. How’s Molly doing? Molly’s good? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s great. Yeah, Molly’s doing great. And — Kevin Rose: How old is Molly now? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s 10. I’m actually going to adopt a — Kevin Rose: Ah. Tim Ferriss: — puppy. I’m going to get a second dog next month. Super excited. Kevin Rose: Toaster’s 15 now. You saw him when you came to the house. Tim Ferriss: I did. Kevin Rose: I wasn’t there when you were there. Tim Ferriss: Oh. Kevin Rose: Isn’t he moving slower? It’s hard to watch. Tim Ferriss: He was. He also had just come from the vet and his paw was all taped up and he was — Kevin Rose: Oh, geez. Tim Ferriss: — drugged out of his mind — Kevin Rose: I know. Tim Ferriss: — when I saw him. Yeah, 15, he’s getting up there. Kevin Rose: I know. We gave him rapa, so I’m hoping for — I mean, we’ve already seen a 20 percent boost in lifespan, so we’ll see. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I need to get Molly on rapa. That’s going to be one of my tasks for December as well. One step at a time. Kevin Rose: Awesome. All right, brother. Tim Ferriss: All right, brother. Great to see you, bud. Kevin Rose: Great to see you. Tim Ferriss: Everybody listening, you can go to the show notes. We’ll have links to everything at tim.blog/podcast. Random Show, just look for the newest one and we’ll have it for you. Happy holidays, everybody. Thanks for tuning in. Kevin Rose: Happy holidays. Tim Ferriss: I’ll see you soon, Kevin.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower on Wednesday after an ADP report showing job losses, following a stellar day across Wall Street on Tuesday. All of the major indices finished the day higher, with the technology-heavy NASDAQ leading the way, closing up 0.59% at 23,413. The S&P 500 ended the session at 6,829, up 0.25% and the Dow Jones Industrials were last seen at 47,474, up 0.39%. Traders and investors are still experiencing weekly volatility whiplash, so it’s difficult to determine whether any given day marks the start or end of a trend, up or down. The one consistent tailwind for stocks is the prospect of another Fed funds rate cut next week, now priced in at an 80% probability, up from as low as 20% a month ago. Strength in technology stocks and a cryptocurrency rally helped to drive shares higher on Tuesday. Yields were down across the curve as buyers returned, and the song remains the same: The anticipation of a rate cut next week, combined with prospects for economic growth in 2026, seems to be the two factors that are driving yields on any given day. With the smart money leaning on President Trump’s economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman, it’s a good bet that rates could be lowered even more in 2026. The 30-year-long bond closed at a 4.75% yield while the benchmark 10-year note finished the session at 4.09% In a complete reversal from yesterday, prices were lower across the energy sector, with both major benchmarks and Natural gas closing lower. The same combination of oversupply and changing prospects for ending the Russia-Ukraine war continues to tip the scales one way or another on any given day. Brent Crude closed Tuesday at $62.43, down 1.17%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen $58.62, down 1.18%. Natural gas completed the trifecta on Tuesday, closing down 1.83% at $4.83. Like the back-up in the energy sector, gold suffered the same fate on Tuesday as the risk-off mood that lifted stocks contributed to the selling in the precious metals. Top sector analysts attributed the move lower to trading accounts taking advantage of the recent moves higher and taking profits. Gold finished the day at $4,226, while Silver was last seen at $57.59. Cryptocurrencies rallied on Tuesday as recent dovish shifts in the Federal Reserve’s policy and the easing of liquidity pressures boosted risk assets like crypto, while advancements in decentralized applications and generally positive market sentiment also contributed to higher prices. The 30% drop in Bitcoin over the last couple of months was also a factor, as bargain-hunting investors were buyers. Bitcoin was trading at $91,494 at 5 PM EST, while Ethereum was quoted at $2,990. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock. Here are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, December 3, 2025.

For most American families, buying (or renting) focuses either heavily or entirely on life’s essentials: housing, food, transportation, education, health care, and other forms of care (child, senior). That a clear majority of American families are, at minimum, stressed by these costs is a consequence of not just a host of factors on the sellers’ side, but of one big factor on the buyers’ side: a half-century of wage stagnation, even as investment income has soared. Or, if you prefer, a half-century of buyers’ income stagnation, even as sellers’ income has soared. More from Harold Meyerson If you depend on investments for most of your income, this is a pretty damn good time. The University of Michigan’s November survey of consumer sentiment finds that Americans who don’t own stock have their lowest confidence level in the economy since the survey began querying stock ownership in 1998. An exception to this mood, the survey notes, is found among the largest stock owners, whose assessment of the economy has actually risen by 11 percent this year. As Emma Janssen has reported in these pages, marketers are going where the money is, like bank robber Willie Sutton. First-class and business-seat travel on the airlines is booming, so much so that seating arrangements on Delta and United are being reconfigured to create more room for the affluent, while coach seats are going unfilled and “discount” airlines struggle. Revenues are up 3 percent this year at the Ritz-Carltons, the Four Seasons, and other luxury hotels, yet down by 3 percent at economy hotels. And when it comes to life’s biggest purchase—a home—the median age of first-time buyers reached 40 this year, an all-time high according to the National Association of Realtors. “All right,” as John Dos Passos wrote in his U.S.A. trilogy in the depth of the Depression, “we are two nations.” Life in the nonaffluent nation is getting harder. According to a Brookings Institution analysis from last year, 43 percent of American families don’t earn enough to pay for housing, food, health care, child care, and transportation; every week, they must juggle which to pay and which not to pay. Among Black and Latino families, those figures rise to 59 percent and 66 percent, respectively. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. It has not been ever thus. In the roughly 30 years following the end of World War II, the nation experienced an unprecedented period of broadly shared prosperity, with workers’ incomes rising in tandem with the nation’s growth in productivity. In 1947, workers captured 70 percent of the total national income; today, that has fallen to roughly 59 percent, while investment income has gained at workers’ expense. As a landmark 1995 study by economists Larry Mishel and Jared Bernstein for the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) revealed, a gap between the rise in productivity and the rise in median workers’ wages opened in the mid-1970s and has grown steadily wider since then; the difference between those two rates today is 55 percent. In the years between 1948 and 1979, when the egalitarian legacy of the New Deal was at its apogee, with high levels of unionization and progressive taxation and constraints on the financial sector, productivity grew by 108 percent and median worker’s compensation by 93 percent. In the years between 1979 and 2025, an EPI analysis found productivity grew by 87 percent but median worker’s compensation by a bare 33 percent. The declining share of national income going to workers hasn’t entirely been the result of the shift from wage income to investment income. There’s also been a shift in the distribution of corporate income to the most highly paid employees, through stock options and other forms of compensation. A 2021 EPI study shows that between 1979 and 2019, real yearly wages for the bottom 90 percent of workers increased by 26 percent, while the wages of those in the 95th to 99th percentile increased by 75 percent, for those in the top 1 percent by 160 percent, and for those in the top 0.1 percent by 345 percent. Worker pay ratios over the past decade have shown that CEOs usually make about 300 times what their median-paid employee makes, a far cry from the 1960s, when the ratio was roughly 20-to-1. Even as labor unions have largely disappeared in the past 60 years, the union of American CEOs—routinely appointed to the executive compensation committees of corporate boards with the blessing or at the instigation of the CEO whose pay they’re setting—has retained its power, adhering to the creed that an injury to one CEO (by, say, paying him or her less than 300 times what workers make) is an injury to all. What would America look like if the gap between worker pay and productivity hadn’t opened? A RAND Corporation study from earlier this year found that the bottom 90 percent of wage earners received about 67 percent of all taxable income in 1975. In 2019, the last year for which this data was available, they received 46.8 percent. Had that bottom 90 percent continued during the past half-century to make the same share of the national income they’d had in 1975, RAND calculates that by 2023 they would have made an additional $79 trillion. Just in the year 2023, they would have made an additional $3.9 trillion. As the size of the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. workforce is roughly 140 million people, that means that the average earner would have made about $28,000 more in 2023 than they actually did. Where have all those missing $28,000 paychecks gone? Well, our nation was home to 1,135 billionaires this year, whose aggregate net worth in 2024 came to a cozy $5.7 trillion. That’s $1.8 trillion more than what it would take to cut 140 million $28,000 paychecks. Corporations aren’t cutting those checks. As EPI’s Nominal Wage Tracker documents, the 80 percent of corporate income that went to employees in 1980 declined to 71.5 percent this year. This is the kind of thing that can irritate workers. As I write in mid-November, 3,200 members of the Machinists union have just completed a three-month strike at three Midwestern Boeing plants. Strikers noted that Boeing devoted $68 billion to stock buybacks between 2010 and 2024—funds that could have gone to developing safer and better planes, and better-compensated workers with more secure retirement benefits. THERE’S A REASON WHY 1979 HAS BECOME the last “postwar normal” year, before the massive upward redistribution of wealth and income, in most of these economic studies. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In his first few months in office, he signed a law reducing the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. (It’s about ten points lower than that today, though most of our super-rich have found ways to get it much closer to zero.) The high marginal tax rates of the postwar decades, peaking at 91 percent during Republican Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency, had effectively put a ceiling on CEO pay. Tesla’s board would not be committing to pay Elon Musk a trillion bucks if Tesla thrives in the coming years under 1950s-era tax rates, where the feds would take the lion’s share above the top marginal bracket. The pre-Reagan tax rates ensured that America’s billionaires would be few and far between, helping to ensure that workers’ potential income wouldn’t be siphoned upward. Twenty years after Reagan, George W. Bush became the first president to lower taxes on the rich during wartime (a war he decided to start absent a plausible threat), and Donald Trump’s successive cuts make even Reagan and Bush look like Keynesians. In 1982, Reagan’s appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) changed a rule that enabled shareholders to claim a greater percentage of corporate wealth. The SEC permitted corporate executives to authorize buybacks of the corporation’s stock, thereby raising the value of the remaining shares on the market. By the 1990s, due to a Clinton-era loophole exempting bonus compensation from corporate taxes, corporations began paying their top executives with shares and options of shares, which made buybacks an easy form of self-enrichment. As economist William Lazonick has exhaustively documented, by the 2000s, most major corporations were diverting more funds to buybacks and dividends than they were investing in growth and research, not to mention employees’ raises. During his first year in office, Reagan also busted PATCO, the air traffic controllers’ union, firing all its members when they went on strike. (By contrast, Republican Richard Nixon had allowed all hundreds of thousands of postal workers who’d participated in a wildcat strike in 1970 to return to their jobs: The Republican Party of Nixon’s day was still closer to the accept-the-New-Deal ethos of Eisenhower than the overturn-the-New-Deal ethos of Reagan.) Reagan’s mass firing inspired private-sector CEOs to do the same with their own employees. During the next several years, a representative sample of leading corporations—Phelps Dodge, Greyhound Bus, Boise Cascade, International Paper, Hormel meatpacking—all slashed pay to provoke strikes, then fired the strikers and hired their replacements at a fraction of their original salaries. During the years of postwar prosperity, strikes were a routine part of the economic landscape, and a major reason why worker pay constituted a decent share of the national income. After PATCO, they nearly disappeared. The number of major strikes plummeted from 286 a year in the 1960s and 1970s, to 83 a year in the 1980s, to 35 a year in the 1990s, to 20 a year in the 2000s. In recent years, the strike has enjoyed a modest revival—autoworkers and teaching assistants have won higher wages by walking picket lines—but unions have shrunk to the point that the fruits of such victories have limited ripple effects. Reagan wasn’t the sole agent of upward redistribution during this time. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker brought down inflation by raising interest rates so high that people stopped buying cars and construction projects slowed to a trickle. The industrial Midwest never recovered. Between 1979 and 1983, 2.4 million manufacturing jobs vanished. The number of U.S. steelworkers went from 450,000 at the start of the 1980s to 170,000 at decade’s end, even as the wages of those who remained shrank by 17 percent. The decline in auto manufacturing was even more precipitous, from 760,000 employees in 1978 to 490,000 three years later. These were the jobs whose union contracts had set the standard for the nation’s blue-collar workers. Finally, also in 1981, at New York’s Pierre Hotel, Jack Welch, General Electric’s new CEO, delivered a kind of inaugural address, which he titled “Growing Fast in a Slow-Growth Economy.” GE, Welch proclaimed, would shed all its divisions that weren’t number one or number two in their markets. If that meant shedding workers, so be it. All that mattered was pushing the company to pre-eminence, and the measure of a company’s pre-eminence was its stock price. Between late 1980 and 1985, Welch reduced the number of GE employees from 411,000 to 299,000. He cut basic research. The company’s stock price soared. And Welch became the model CEO for a corporate America going fully neoliberal. WHAT THE EARLY 1980S INAUGURATED GREW APACE over the subsequent 40 years. Emboldened by Reagan’s opposition to unions, CEOs and corporate boards routinely directed their companies to violate the laws that had empowered workers to form and join unions. In 2016 and 2017, employers were charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act in 41.5 percent of all unionization campaigns, often by firing workers involved in those campaigns. The penalties for being found guilty of such charges are negligible, and Democrats’ efforts to amend the NLRA so that the penalties actually have some effect on employer conduct have never been able to win the support of the 60 senators required to break a filibuster to enact such amendments. So it is that most unionized private companies were unionized many decades ago, and almost all the major companies that have been created since (including the two largest private-sector employers, Walmart and Amazon) have rebuffed their employees’ unionization efforts through illegal threats and firings. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Even when workers have managed to win unionization, that doesn’t mean they actually are able to bargain a first contract. An EPI study showed that 63 percent of the time during 2018, workers in newly unionized companies hadn’t been able to get their employer to agree to a contract within one year of their unionizing, as there’s no law requiring employers to bargain in a timely fashion. Amazon, for instance, has yet even to begin bargaining with the Staten Island warehouse workers, who decisively voted to join a union to much fanfare back in April of 2022. These are among the factors that explain why the rate of American worker unionization has declined from one-third in the middle of the 20th century to just under 10 percent today, and a bare 6 percent in the private sector. Another factor, both in the shrinking of unions and the shrinking of worker pay, is the move of major corporations’ production facilities from the unionized Northern and Midwestern states to the right-to-work, anti-union South. The spread of Southern pay standards to the rest of the nation—a tale whose protagonist is most certainly Walmart—also served to bring down national pay levels in retail. The late 1970s deregulation of the trucking industry, by effectively negating the Teamsters’ nationwide contract with long-distance trucking companies that had covered nearly half of U.S. truck drivers, proved to be a huge hit to drivers’ incomes, by some estimates cutting them in half. This November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. Trade deals and offshoring have damaged workers considerably. NAFTA was the nation’s first trade treaty with a low-wage nation (Mexico), and our end-of-the-century trade deal with China greatly exacerbated the depressing effect on American workers’ wages. Both an EPI study and another by MIT’s David Autor and several co-authors independently concluded that such deals lowered the wage of non-college-graduate U.S. workers by 5.6 percent, taking an average bite out of their yearly income of roughly $2,000. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 currently comes to roughly 29 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. In 1968, the federal minimum wage came to 53 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. Worker misclassification as independent contractors (as in the cases of Amazon delivery drivers and Uber and Lyft drivers) reduces incomes, exempts workers from wage and hour legislation, and generally means they lack the benefits (such as health insurance) that customarily accrue to corporate employees. EPI’s 2021 study on the factors reducing workers’ income estimated that nine million American workers were then misclassified, reducing their incomes by anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent. A 2019 study by Brandeis University economist David Weil, who was in charge of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor during the Obama presidency, found that drivers employed directly by UPS, who also worked under a contract with the Teamsters, earned $23.10 an hour, while the “independent contractor” drivers for FedEx earned $14.40 an hour, and those for Amazon, a paltry $5.30 an hour. Amazon is currently in court contesting the unionization of a number of those drivers, making the argument that the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional. Noncompete agreements tucked into employment contracts forbid workers from taking a job with other businesses in the same sector or starting their own businesses in that sector. Initially devised to keep a small number of specialized employees from taking proprietary information to competitor companies, these agreements have now spread to workers at nail salons, barbershops, and just about any other kind of business. An EPI survey of businesses with at least 50 employees found that somewhere between one-quarter and one-half of all private-sector workers were subject to noncompetes. During the Biden presidency, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the NLRB found this practice to be a violation of law, and the FTC formally banned noncompetes nationwide. But those findings and rules have not been carried over, of course, to their Trump administration successors. Corporate concentration, as the other feature articles in this issue abundantly document, is a huge factor in price increases afflicting the American consumer. It’s also a factor in limiting American workers’ incomes. In 2017, MIT’s Autor and other co-authors estimated that the increase in product market concentration accounted for a third of the decline in labor’s share of the national income for the years between 1997 and 2012. The shrinking of employer options relieves employers of the pressure created by workers flocking to higher-paying rivals. In opposing the merger of the Albertsons and Kroger supermarket chains, Biden’s FTC argued that it would lead not only to price hikes but also to lower wages for their workers unless they remained separate companies. In weighing the relative responsibility of all these factors in creating the widening gap between productivity increases and median wage increases from 1979 through 2017, a 2021 EPI study by Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens concluded that excessive unemployment levels (due chiefly to Federal Reserve policies), the decline of collective bargaining, and globalization (devised by and benefiting corporations) explain roughly 55 percent of that gap, while misclassification of workers, subcontracting, noncompete agreements, and corporate concentration add up to 20 percent. OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS, THE FUNDAMENTALS of the postwar economy that were put in place by the New Deal have been discarded at the behest and insistence of wealthy interests and individuals who’ve sought a much higher share of the national income. Creating a more equitable economy—effectively, reinventing a vibrant American middle class—will be an arduous task. That said, this November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The affordability solutions put forth by Zohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, and Mikie Sherrill in their successful campaigns are just a start in what will be a long and difficult struggle. Herewith, some suggestions on the path to a more broadly shared prosperity and an affordable future. First, nothing increases worker bargaining power like full employment. The next Democratic president’s appointees to the Federal Reserve must be committed to raising ordinary Americans’ share of the national income. That requires the low interest rates essential for a thriving economy. Denmark’s policy of providing free job training and up to 90 percent of their salary to laid-off workers has been a success in boosting that nation’s employment levels and mitigating the effects of an economic downturn. Second, the return of collective bargaining. That necessitates labor law reforms that enable workers to unionize by signing affiliation cards; require employers to recognize unions when their workers have obtained those cards from a majority of employees; require employers to settle on contracts with unionized workers within a fixed time (90 days? 120 days?) or submit to compulsory arbitration; abolish “right to work” laws; make corporations the co-employers of record with their franchises; enable sector-wide bargaining in various sectors, thereby setting the same minimum wage and benefit standards for all of that industry’s employees, unionized or not; and perhaps enable bargaining from “minority” unions to which at least 25 percent of employees belong, so long as no union has achieved majority status. Today, unions are among the most well-thought-of American institutions, getting roughly 70 percent approval ratings in the annual Gallup polls, even as the rate of private-sector unionization is less than one-tenth of that. It’s primarily the weakness of labor law that has spawned this widest of gaps; that law must be changed if that gap is to shrink. Third, raise the minimum wage to the level of a living wage, sufficient to pay for all life’s essentials. An MIT study this year has estimated the living wage for a family in each of the 50 states, from $22.43 an hour in Mississippi to $34.55 in California. A federal law could mandate such procedures for the states. A paper released in October by California-based economists Martin Carnoy, Michael Reich, and Derek Shearer suggests an anti-inflationary accompaniment to such raises would be a rigorous antitrust policy that would yield more competitive pricing in retailing. Fourth, family-friendly financial policies. That could begin with a yearly federal payment to families with children, at an initial level of $5,000 per child. A Brookings Institution study has estimated that a middle-income family spends $310,605 to raise one child from birth to 17. The cost of child-rearing is such that it simply deters many families from having children. This is an area where our government must adopt the kind of policies that the governments of most nations with advanced economies have long since enacted. Universal free child care and pre-kindergarten could cut these costs to families, as well as enabling mothers to continue in their careers, which boosts family incomes. In a recent paper for the Economic Security Project, Becky Chao and Mike Konczal document that Americans generally become parents when their earnings have yet to achieve mid-career levels, making the prospect of having children a financially fraught one. They argue for substantial child tax credits and earned income tax credits to address this structural gap between the costs of parenting and the income levels of young workers. Similarly, they also argue for more generous Social Security payments for the elderly and disabled. Fifth, a ban on noncompete and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Sixth, the adoption of industrial policies, such as those advanced during the Biden administration, that revitalize domestic industries and lessen our dependence on imports from low-wage nations that have the effect of reducing the incomes of workers here at home. As the robotization of production work continues, manufacturing and transportation will employ fewer workers than they currently do, but the remaining workers in those sectors should not have their incomes reduced either by foreign competition or by the kinds of employment arrangements and opposition to unions that currently characterize our economy. Where unions have power, they can insist that smaller workforces receive the benefits of higher productivity, as the longshore unions have succeeded in doing during the past decades of mechanization and containerization, making their members’ jobs the highest-paying blue-collar jobs in America. Seventh, a thorough reworking of our tax system. Higher taxes on the rich and corporations are clearly needed to fund the kind of programs listed above, and with the nation’s wealth disparities reaching stratospheric proportions, some form of wealth taxes must be adopted as well. The best argument for adopting such a tax is that right now, only the most common and widely held form of wealth—homes—is subjected to that kind of tax. If we can tax the wealth of middle-income families, why can’t we tax the wealth—such as stocks and other investments—of the truly wealthy? Certainly, the capital gains tax should be raised to the level of the income tax on work, and the SEC rule on buybacks should be revoked. None of this will happen so long as money dominates our politics, so the Supreme Court decisions enabling that domination—Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo—should be undone, if not by Democratic-appointed successors to the current justices, then by other work-arounds, such as the current effort in Montana to rewrite the state’s corporate charters so they deny corporations the power to involve themselves in elections. Americans increasingly understand that our current economy isn’t meeting their interests and that it’s rigged to favor the wealthy. A sizable public will welcome candidates who expand the Overton window of economic reforms such as those suggested here, just as there were sizable publics that backed the reforms laid out by Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani in their campaigns. Indeed, a national YouGov poll taken one week after Mamdani’s election showed that every one of his platform planks commanded majority support from the American people, including 69 percent support for raising taxes on corporations and millionaires, 66 percent support for free child care for children from six months to five years, and even 57 percent support for government-owned grocery stores. There’s no reason why Democrats who don’t call themselves socialists can’t do well running on such reforms. This would be a very opportune time for them to start.

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Earlier this year, a slightly balding man in spectacles, a black T-shirt, and bright high-top sneakers gave a presentation about how his computer can predict what you want to buy. His name is Dr. Uri Yerushalmi, co-founder and chief artificial intelligence officer of Fetcherr, an Israeli-based pricing consultant used by a half dozen airlines around the world. “While most of us in the AI community have been focusing on building models that are generating either text or image, in Fetcherr we have been focusing during the last five years on building large market models,” Yerushalmi said. Trained on years of market data—prices, orders, competitors, regulation, stock prices, even the weather—Fetcherr’s “business agents” aim to simulate market dynamics, assist pricing analysts, and even automatically price tickets. More from David Dayen One presentation slide stuck out. It showed price fluctuations before the use of Fetcherr’s system and after. In the before graph, prices are relatively static and straight. After Fetcherr, the jagged lines pulse with staccato rhythms. “The dynamic is much more similar to dynamics in NASDAQ or capital markets where the prices change much more frequently,” said Yerushalmi, “because every time something in the market changes, there is an immediate response.” Yerushalmi once ran AI for a high-speed stock trading firm. He approaches pricing like a science experiment, engaging in constant real-time testing and tweaking to maximize corporate profits. Fetcherr boasts of delivering annual “revenue uplift” of over 10 percent. The guinea pigs for these tests, the ones being separated from their cash, are you and me. AI can depict you as an anime character. It can respond half-intelligently to questions about the Franco-Prussian War or concentrations of sulfur in the upper atmosphere. It can delight and distract and maybe help you get work done. But none of that is as prized by corporate America as its data-driven approach to the previously conjectural world of pricing. Supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. “That’s the use case they don’t want you to talk about. That’s why we’re building all these data centers,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. “As we have built social media platforms that shape the flow of information across society, now we are building the platforms that control the flow of money.” Technology-fueled pricing is more widespread than once thought, presenting serious policy challenges in an age where affordability is on everyone’s minds. AI bots are colluding with one another, anticipating consumer choices, and accumulating surplus—that is, transferring wealth—for the businesses that employ them. It’s part of why corporate profits hit record highs after the pandemic and have stayed there. The public recoils at the thought of seeing prices tick up based on when they like to get lunch or what device they’re using. When Delta, which employs Fetcherr as a pricing agent, announced on an earnings call this summer that up to 20 percent of its flights would be priced using AI by the end of the year, the outcry was so intense that the company claimed its critics were peddling “misinformation.” Policymakers and advocates have united to crack down on some tactics, winning real legislative victories from coast to coast. But every step government takes can be countered by AI price-setters. How can consumers keep up? “What worries me is that it will become hyperefficient to price discriminate and to charge more in ways that ordinary people will not be able to combat,” said Doha Mekki, the top deputy at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division under Joe Biden. “And it will make a very bad cost-of-living crisis even worse.” A YEAR AGO, I WROTE ABOUT WHAT I TERMED surveillance pricing: companies offering individualized prices based on personal data. The idea was that a business equipped with granular information about demographics, purchase history, social and financial interactions, or even medical status could exploit a customer’s willingness to pay. Uber could charge more when a rider booked on a company credit card; people aren’t as price-sensitive when someone else is paying. Delta could jack up fares after learning that a traveler needs to attend a funeral; desperation could translate into opportunity. I couldn’t be certain how many businesses used surveillance pricing. The proliferation of third-party pricing consultants touting “digital pricing transformations” seemed like a strong indicator. But concealment was key to the strategy, to minimize the anger generated by charging different prices to different people. For instance, when a reporter at SFGate logged in to hotel booking platforms using his regular IP address in high-wage San Francisco, he received a quote of $829 a night. But when he used a virtual private network set up to originate from Phoenix or Kansas City, prices were more than $500 less. Without a public price, it takes research to understand if someone is being ripped off. A month after my report, Lina Khan’s Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into surveillance pricing, seeking information from eight third-party consultants. The agency only had a short time to conduct the study before the changeover of power in Washington. But days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it issued “research summaries” of the work done thus far. (Trump’s FTC has yet to finish the study.) Stephanie Nguyen, the FTC’s chief technologist under Khan, told me those eight pricing consultants were working with over 250 clients, suggesting broad reach across the economy. Services included individually targeted pricing, segmentation of customers based on their profiles, and ranking tools that alter what products people see atop a web page or search. A customer clicking on fast shipping, for example, suggests an urgency that would lead them to tolerate higher prices. The key to surveillance pricing is data. Nguyen and Sam Levine, the FTC’s former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, recently wrote a paper about how customers deliver that data when they sign up for loyalty programs. Enticed by promised discounts and concierge treatment, customers consent to data collection that allows companies to build intricate social graphs; one customer profile created by the grocery chain Kroger stretched to 62 pages. The discounts often aren’t maintained or are curtailed, loyalty card fees expand over time, and the more loyal a customer, the more data is collected and the more they pay over time, according to the report. One case study is the McDonald’s app, which has 185 million users and provides seamless access on smartphones, our personal data-spewing machines. According to a recent earnings call, after downloading the app, a customer goes from 10.5 annual McDonald’s visits on average to 26. McDonald’s clearly wants its customers on the app. Its popular Monopoly game gives out stickers on the packaging of items like Big Macs and fries; you collect the right ones to win big prizes. But this year, instead of filling out a physical game board, Monopoly pieces now must be scanned into the app. “This is about taxing people who don’t turn over their data, and manipulating people who do,” Levine said. “Do we really want a world in which you will have to pay a premium if you want to shop anonymously?” Surveillance pricing is just one technology that companies use to set prices. Surge pricing accelerates supply and demand to raise prices when more people want the product or service. Subscription pricing offers products for a monthly fee, a steady stream of revenue from absent-minded customers that can feature deceptive sign-ups and impossible cancellation policies. Trump’s FTC sued Uber for a subscription service that takes as many as 23 screens and 32 actions to cancel; Amazon Prime’s cancellation policy, the subject of a separate FTC settlement that cost the company $2.5 billion, was internally nicknamed “Iliad Flow,” like the tortuous war Odysseus waged in the Greek epic. Electronic shelf tags at Walmart and other grocers have triggered fears of endlessly changing prices while you shop. FIFA has confirmed use of differential pricing for World Cup events based on demand, something New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has criticized. “They can become a tool for pure extraction and leave everybody paying what they shouldn’t,” said Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, which monitors event ticketing. One of the most insidious uses of technology is on the wage side. An issue brief from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth focused on how companies are using personal data to set worker pay, something first seen in the ride-hailing industry. Twenty AI consultants offer surveillance wage services to clients in logistics, manufacturing, retail, finance, education, transportation, technology, and health care, which is “the new Uber in a lot of ways,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California and co-author of the report. The AI systems can adjust worker pay in real time, and offer different wages to people doing the same work. They can adjust wages based on performance data, customer feedback, and even factors off the job, such as “predictive analytics that attempt to determine a worker’s potential tolerance for low pay,” the report notes. Most of these wage-setting practices are opaque to workers or their bargaining representatives. “This is becoming normalized,” Dubal said. “It fundamentally undermines the well-worn and very American idea that hard work should result in higher pay.” The result of these strategies is that supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. AI-based pricing has become more critical than sale volume or product quality. Customers seeking a fair deal are simply outworked, unable to avoid being targeted. “There used to be moments where you really blew it, you had to buy a last-minute airline ticket and they’ve got you,” said Tim Wu, former competition policy chief in the Biden White House. “That’s really daily life now.” Consumers used to benefit from what economists would call imperfect information. The uncertainty of defining the optimal price, and the ability in open markets for new businesses to undercut competitors, gave consumers a fighting chance to get a deal, or just to manage their life without being tracked and prodded. Technology eliminates that information inefficiency. “What these technologies are about is eliminating all risk for the shareholder,” Hepner said. “There’s no more error. It is a well-oiled extraction machine.” EVEN ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED by the furiousness of the response to technology-aided pricing. As post-pandemic inflation swelled, AI trickery was a tangible, easy-to-understand depiction of an economy rigged against ordinary people, and the lack of transparency and unpredictability vexed consumers. “It was hiding in plain sight and everyone has found it and you just can’t unsee it,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. Politicians looking for anti-inflation messaging rode the wave of constituent anger. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) challenged Delta’s palpable glee over surveillance pricing in an earnings call, and when Delta responded that they wouldn’t actually target customers using their personal data, Gallego didn’t let up. After all, Delta’s president Glen Hauenstein said on the earnings call that “to get [travelers] the right offer in your hand at the right time” is the “Holy Grail,” which sure sounds like surveillance pricing. “Delta is telling their investors one thing, and then turning around and telling the public another,” Gallego said in a statement. House Democrats proposed a bill to ban surveillance pricing and surveillance wage-setting. So-called “drip pricing,” where junk fees are added during a sale, was effectively banned in event ticketing and hotel stays by an FTC rule finalized in May. But with GOP control of Washington, the real action has moved to the states. Surveillance pricing bans were introduced in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota; surge pricing bans for grocery stores and restaurants were introduced in New York and Maine. By July, 24 states had seen bills introduced over some form of technology-aided pricing, according to a tracker from Consumer Reports. In a major win this year, the nation’s two largest blue states explicitly banned algorithmic price-fixing, a tactic famously used by RealPage, which aggregated data from landlords across a city and recommended coordinated rent hikes. Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued RealPage, reaching settlements with corporate landlords vowing to end the practice. But data aggregators like Agri Stats and PotatoTrac already do this for meat and produce, and states wanted to prevent tech-enabled collusion from expanding. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Advocates were pushing on an open door; housing is the biggest monthly expense people have. “When RealPage came out, it quickly mapped onto something people feel viscerally,” said Samantha Gordon, chief advocacy officer at TechEquity, which lobbied on the California tech pricing bills. Moreover, since price-fixing is illegal when human beings enter a smoke-filled room and collude, extending that to algorithmic collusion made sense to lawmakers. That was the concept behind California’s AB 325, which states that “common pricing algorithms,” whether informed through public or nonpublic competitor data, violate the Cartwright Act, California’s antitrust law. The law lowers the evidence standard to prove an algorithmic pricing conspiracy. It also prohibits anyone from distributing a pricing tool that coerces the setting of a recommended price, protecting small businesses along with consumers, explained Hepner, who was active in drafting the bill. “We saw mom-and-pop businesses swept up into these pricing schemes,” he said. “If you want to get the buy box on Amazon, you have to use their smart pricing tool. You have to give up independent decision-making authority to participate in the economy.” After seven rounds of amendments, AB 325 passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed it in October. Days later, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) signed S.7882, another prohibition on coordinated price-fixing via software, though limited to rental housing. The New York law also blocks landlords from using algorithms to set “lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions.” Cities like Jersey City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Seattle have enacted similar citywide collusion bans, and 51 algorithmic price-fixing bills were introduced nationwide in just the 2025 legislative session. It’s “a potentially very powerful first step in tilting some of this economy back in favor of consumers,” Hepner said. The best way to get at surveillance pricing might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. Surveillance pricing bills have not seen the same success, though their failure revealed critical information. In California, AB 446, which would have banned pricing based on personal data, was held back, giving sponsors time to build support next year. That’s because businesses across the economy, even ones not suspected of surveillance pricing, swarmed Sacramento to defend their practices. “It was fascinating over the course of that legislative process to see the opposition come out and openly say, ‘Hey, we’re actually doing this, you mean we can’t do this anymore?’” Hepner told me. Some economists allege that tech pricing crackdowns threaten discounts and other potential benefits for consumers. But it’s hard to believe that companies would hire the most sophisticated engineers to figure out how to reduce their revenues. As Nguyen told me, the argument to preserve discounts boils down to this: “You can have privacy or low prices, but you can’t have both.” A modest breakthrough came in New York, which passed a disclosure law requiring that relevant transactions include a pop-up stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The National Retail Federation sued to block the law, but in October, a federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that the disclaimer “is plainly factual.” Advocates believe that the legal victory will give policymakers permission to revisit the topic. But the fierce pushback showed that AI-based pricing was no longer a speculative harm. “So many companies and industries trying to kill [surveillance pricing bans] told us everything we need to know on why everything is getting more and more expensive,” Gordon concluded. RealPage got the message as well. As the price-fixing bills worked their way through statehouses, the company announced it was acquiring Livble, a property management software tool. With Livble integrated into their platform, RealPage said, residents could subdivide rental payments into installments based on real-time cash flow landlords can see. In other words, RealPage was trying out surveillance pricing. THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS FROM ONE SCHEME to the next make it difficult for policymakers to stay ahead of the curve. For example, Lyft, one of the early adopters of surge pricing, reacted to rider anger about the service being more expensive precisely when they needed it most by moving to something called Price Lock, a subscription-based pricing tool that caps fares on targeted routes—for a monthly fee. Another tactic involves redefining basic terms. When Delta claimed it would not use personal data, it added that it was merely “enhanc[ing] our existing fare pricing processes” with AI. “The lack of regulations about this and the way people’s data can be collected and used allows them to play around with what they are calling personal data and use,” said Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. This forces policymakers to think more broadly, even on the outer edges of the possible. “I do worry that we’re always going to be chasing the companies,” said Sam Levine. “I think companies need to advertise a price publicly that’s available to all consumers … there should be a basic principle to advertise a price and it’s deceptive to charge more than that.” Levine’s testimony to Congress this summer hits on another option: limiting collection of personal data, rather than just its usage. “‘Surveillance pricing’ is only possible because of how companies collect, share, and weaponize our personal data,” he told lawmakers, while arguing that relying on outdated tools to safeguard privacy risked further abuse. Consumer protection and anti-monopoly experts are warming to this idea of cutting the data off at the source. Companies, after all, provide a full road map of what they collect in the privacy policies almost nobody reads. Levine and Nguyen’s loyalty program paper documents privacy policies, finding that rental car giant Hertz admits to collecting demographic and behavioral data, Home Depot tracks Wi-Fi usage inside their stores, and Macy’s captures customer driver’s licenses. Much of this data is sold to third-party data brokers, who share it with other businesses. A data minimization standard could prevent use of personal information for pricing, Winters suggested. Mekki added that antitrust law recognizes that antitrust remedies often call for disgorgement of whatever gives companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Applied to surveillance pricing, that would argue for destroying the data allowing them to price-set. “If you can be forced to give up money or property, it stands to reason that you need to give up data,” she said. The bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act introduced last year would have limited collection of certain kinds of data and given people the ability to opt out of having their data used to target them or sold to third parties. But this is at least the third major comprehensive privacy bill in the internet era that’s gone nowhere in Congress; too many companies are invested in the surveillance economy to let it be legislated out of existence. “This is a textbook example of people not getting what they want,” said Wu, whose recent book The Age of Extraction highlights Big Tech platform-ization multiplying across the economy. “Is there anyone in America who wants less privacy or thinks it’s fine, or really wants targeted ads? The constituency is zero … In 20 years of privacy laws, there hasn’t been a single vote. This is not even a conspiracy. The tech industry lobbyists specialize in one thing: killing privacy laws.” Some states have fared better, with a dozen passing limitations on data collection or letting consumers opt out of targeted ads or sale of personal data. California updated its policy this legislative session by passing AB 566, which allows internet users to opt out of data collection at the browser level, rather than having to go website by website. But practically all privacy legislation has carve-outs for “bona fide loyalty programs,” giving companies an escape hatch under the guise of offering discounts. Even given that, however, loyalty programs are not exempt from “excessive” collection under these statutes that is not reasonably necessary. Maryland recently finalized a privacy law that prevents companies from conditioning loyalty programs on the sale of data, despite industry pushback. The best way to get at this activity might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. That includes companies acting as data brokers by selling and trading data, and the third-party pricing consultants they share the data with. Data sales could be considered unfair or deceptive under state consumer protection laws. And even when customers consent to having their data collected, they may not be consenting to transferring that data to third parties. “State enforcers should be thinking, under what circumstances is it lawful for companies to share personal data with pricing consultants?” Levine said. Under Lina Khan, the FTC made headway by looking at these agglomerations of data as unfair practices, and subsequently prohibiting the sale of sensitive data, like when someone visits an abortion clinic. Today’s FTC has walked away from this enforcement, but their past work outlines a path for states to argue that targeted pricing is similarly unfair. AI PRICING WON’T LOOK THE SAME IN FIVE YEARS as it does now, but we have hints of where it’s going. That’s why the role of Fetcherr is more interesting than Delta’s meandering explanations for how it uses AI. Airlines have been at the forefront of every pricing innovation of the past 30 years, from junk fees to differential pricing to loyalty programs. What’s the next frontier? Fetcherr, which closed $90 million in funding in 2024 and another $42 million this year, tells you right on its website: “hyper-personalization at scale.” (Or at least, it used to tell you that, before it scrubbed this section.) “We’re talking about understanding each customer as an individual, optimizing every interaction for maximum value,” the now-redacted section states, detailing how its AI model uses data points like “customer lifetime value, past purchase behaviors, and the real-time context of each booking inquiry” to give each passenger their own product bundle at a bespoke price. The goal isn’t just a pleasant customer experience—it’s “revenue growth.” Robby Nissan, a Fetcherr co-founder, has said publicly that its AI systems can “manipulat[e] the market in order to gain more profit.” There’s not a lot of mystery here. There are other airline pricing consultants, like Peter Thiel–backed FLYR and PROS and Air Price IQ. But the pitch is the same: maximizing travelers’ willingness to pay by analyzing reams of data. If you want to see the dystopia of perfect information accurately predicting exactly how much you’ll pay for a service, just book a flight this Christmas. “It’s a very real example of how AI-based pricing schemes put consumers into economic silos,” Hepner said. “You cannot comparison shop anymore. You cannot predict what a price is supposed to be anymore.” This is facilitated by a concentrated economy where markets aren’t as open to alternatives to AI-optimized schemes. But AI pricing may shrink choice even further. For example, Delta recently stopped flying from LAX to London Heathrow Airport, despite the popularity of the route. Virgin Atlantic still makes the LAX-Heathrow trip; it’s a joint venture partner with Delta, and perhaps as important, both of them use Fetcherr. Was canceling the route an AI-enabled suggestion to benefit another client? We will never know. Large market models running millions of price tests with thousands of input signals could short-circuit restrictions on surveillance pricing or data minimization. If it’s all just simulations, after all, is it really using personal data? Another future is glimpsed in the rise of AI agents that shop for you. ChatGPT users will soon be able to link their PayPal accounts for instant purchases based on chatbot recommendations. Walmart has partnered with OpenAI for e-commerce as well. Autonomous bots with a linked bank account could even shop on their own, something a new AI agent lobby is trying to facilitate in Washington. There’s little transparency on how products are recommended, how prices are derived, or whether AI agents will act in the interest of consumers or the retailers they’re partnering with. “You’re delegating purchasing power to one algorithm to interface with another,” said Ben Winters. “You’re getting people signed up into these systems where they have no control.” But there’s also a brighter future possible, one where the backlash to nonstop data collection and pricing subterfuge accelerates, and people simply demand a fair price. Polling shows that the public is deeply skeptical that AI will work in their favor. Consumers may not have much control, but they do hold the dollars companies need to thrive, and they can withhold them from companies that treat them poorly. “I think it’s possible that this is headed back to cost-based pricing,” said Owens, whose book Gouged about the new era of pricing releases next year. “It’s the way companies priced for decades … There is a world where the outcome is transparent, public, predictable pricing.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: How Campbell’s leaked audio turned a pantry staple into a PR crisis

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Just as families across the U.S. were heading into Thanksgiving weekend and stocking up on Campbell’s staples, a leaked audio recording landed online of a company vice president mocking Indian workers, calling customers “poor people,” and claiming its soups contained “bioengineered” or “3D” meat. The timing was combustible. A brand associated with holiday comfort was suddenly overshadowed by a senior leader’s contemptuous voice, directed at the very people who buy and make its products. Campbell confirmed the recording’s believed authenticity and removed the executive from his role. Several elements of the story emerged through a lawsuit filed by cybersecurity analyst Robert Garza, who alleges he told his manager about the comments in January, was discouraged from reporting them, and was later terminated. Campbell disputes that timeline, saying it first learned of the lawsuit months later and heard only “segments” of the audio on November 20. Regardless of how those details are adjudicated, once the recording went public, the question shifted from one executive’s conduct to the organization’s ability to confront issues before they escalate. These alleged events surfaced three essential truths about leadership that extend far beyond this single episode. The blowback was swift because Campbell is not merely a food manufacturer. Its products occupy a symbolic place on holiday tables, and the remarks felt like a direct insult to the households that rely on them. Consumers interpreted the comments as a reflection of how a leader with influence viewed the people who sustain the brand. Culture is judged in moments like this—not by corporate messaging but by private conduct that contradicts it. The allegations about internal handling reveal a more profound leadership truth: Trust within companies is fragile. Reporting systems work only when employees believe their concerns will be taken seriously rather than met with indifference or retaliation. When people think the organization is unwilling or unable to act, the crisis becomes bigger than the initial misconduct. The episode also highlights the modern fact that private comments are never entirely private. Power attracts scrutiny, and the tools to record unguarded moments are everywhere. The answer is to ensure that even one’s private behavior is consistent with the values the company claims to uphold. The final takeaway: What happened at Campbell ultimately reinforces why leadership is judged at its edges. The quiet moments and the offhand comments reveal far more about a leader’s integrity and C-suite readiness than any formal performance review ever could.

Title: DoorDash CEO Tony Xu outmaneuvered meal delivery rivals by obsessing over his customer

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:39:57Z

Good morning. If Americans treated their post-Thanksgiving Day exhaustion with take-out this weekend, there’s a good chance they ordered from DoorDash. The meal delivery giant now controls 60% of the market in the U.S and is more than twice the size of its closest competitor, Uber Eats. It wasn’t always that way. In a new Fortune feature, tech correspondent Jason Del Rey rode along with DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on a delivery run and got a front-seat look at how Xu built the scrappy upstart into an unexpected powerhouse in the cutthroat meal delivery industry. The startup founded in 2013 by Xu and three fellow Stanford students once had less than $30,000 left in its bank account. Now, thanks to grit, ingenuity, and a heaping serving of luck, it’s on track to generate more than $13 billion this year. Here a few lessons other leaders can learn from DoorDash and CEO Xu:Zig when others zag: Early on, DoorDash distinguished itself in the crowded meal delivery space by enlisting gig workers to pick up—and sometimes even order—food, whereas then-rivals Grubhub and Seamless only partnered with restaurants that had their own delivery drivers. Obsess over your customer: Xu prides himself on sweating the small stuff to improve service. For instance, DoorDash now highlights desserts on orders because they are the most likely to be forgotten. Its app also advises “Dashers” on where to park and which building entrance to use. Stay in touch with the front-line experience: Every corporate DoorDash employee in the U.S. must do four delivery shifts a year. On Jason’s ride-along, CEO Xu attempted to deliver four orders in San Francisco. He managed to drop off three and earned $19 for the hour’s worth of work. (DoorDash would top up that amount.) Xu’s hands-on experience stands out in a world in which the ultra-wealthy are living increasingly private lives. Strike when there’s blood: When Uber Eats’ parent was rehabilitating its culture and imposing financial discipline in the late 2010s, DoorDash went on a spending blitz. It poached several UberEats executives and expanded from 1,500 locations to 6,000, including into mid-tier cities and suburban towns that rivals had neglected. Be ready when opportunity hits: DoorDash’s investment in the suburbs paid off when the COVID pandemic pushed convenience-obsessed consumers out of cities and turned sit-down restaurants on to delivery. DoorDash’s business more than tripled in 2020. Jason cautions that DoorDash’s lead isn’t safe. It could “be displaced by a competitor like Uber—or an AI-native company that may not yet even exist.” But for now it’s won the meal delivery wars and is moving into new markets, like grocery delivery, where the battle for dominance may be just as fierce.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly the frontrunner for the job but declined to address whether he was the top candidate in an interview Sunday.

A Deloitte survey shows they plan to cut spending 34% this year, steeper than any other cohort. Only Gen Xers, aged 45 to 60, plan to spend more. Frozen salaries Major consulting firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group have frozen starting salaries for the third straight year as AI imposes more cautious hiring practices in the industry. AI is making junior employees more productive, putting downward pressure on their pay. Smartphone risks for kids A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that children who had a smartphone by age 12 were at higher risk of depression, obesity, and inadequate sleep compared to their phoneless peers. The research included 10,500 kids in the U.S., making it the largest long-term look at children’s brain development in the country to date. AI job displacement An MIT study published last week found that nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce could already be replaced by AI systems. The report notably found that AI models can complete tasks in finance and health care, not just in technology or coding. Great Wealth Transfer won’t be a ‘big bang’ Northwestern Mutual CEO Tim Gerend told Fortune that the Great Wealth Transfer between Baby Boomers and younger generations won’t be a “big bang” like many expect but instead will come gradually. For young people who are “really anxious” about the economy, per Gerend, waiting for that inheritance only adds to their unease. S&P 500 futures are down 0.55% this morning.

Title: Sources of America’s Hidden Inflation

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Prices have been rising across the economy in ways that are both visible and opaque. There are short-term drivers of inflation due to President Trump’s mismanagement of the economy. But the deeper drivers result from the degradation of capitalism. For example, the lethal combination of digital technology and tech monopolies picks your pocket in countless ways. Instead of technical advances leading to greater convenience and lower cost, as they logically should, they create strategies for opportunistic price hikes. More from Robert Kuttner When Amazon uses its deep knowledge of consumer preferences to rig markets and undermine competitors, higher prices are passed along. When HP makes it illegal or impossible for consumers to use cheaper non-HP cartridges in their printers, it can charge exorbitant prices. If you are prohibited from repairing your own car or your own iPhone, or as a farmer, prohibited from saving seed for next year’s planting, that invites monopoly profits built on higher prices. Costs rise because the rules are rigged. It isn’t just the increasing cost of health insurance, but the tax on your time when a health system of byzantine complexity requires you to waste hours to get a simple referral or get a claim paid. Middlemen and algorithms, both in the business of denying claims, are a direct cost to the system and a source of rising out-of-pocket prices to patients. If insurance doesn’t pay, you do. These middlemen also function as a drain on doctor time and thus a tax on doctors’ incomes, as well as a debasement of medical services In this special issue of the Prospect, we take stock of several hidden drivers of rising costs. David Dayen explores all the ways that technology allows sellers of any product that uses the internet to take advantage of surveillance capitalism to personalize prices and charge more than the market price that would be produced by ordinary supply and demand. It’s another case of monopoly pricing power, facilitated by invasive technology. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. As Emma Janssen writes, plutocracy is a driver of the affordability crisis. The top 10 percent of income earners now do close to half of the spending, by some estimates. This has led to “premiumization,” where airline seats, concert tickets, and even staple goods are priced for wealthier people because they are the primary buyers. That in turn drives prices higher for everyone else, as anyone who buys a ticket to a concert or a sporting event appreciates. Antitrust policy has thus far failed to curb obvious abuses by middlemen ticket sellers. Paul Starr writes in a sidebar that these trends invert the 20th-century pattern of affordable culture, beginning with nickel movie tickets and cheap bleacher seats. As the concert ticket example shows, middlemen are drivers of the affordability crisis. As Whitney Curry Wimbish writes, across the economy, from pharmaceuticals to real estate to meatpacking and more, middlemen sit in between suppliers and customers and squeeze out a layer of profit for themselves, taking advantage of their knowledge of industries and typically concentrated control of the supply chain. Regulatory capture, as James Baratta points out, is another source of price increases. Baratta’s focus is on electricity rates, and the failure of state public utility commissions to protect ratepayers from extractive price hikes based on dubious economic models used by utility companies. There is an even more subtle and insidious version of regulatory capture, in which regulations themselves are used to enforce industry’s anti-competitive strategies. As Cory Doctorow observes in his indispensable book Enshittification (reviewed in our October issue), far more sinister than traditional regulatory capture is regulatory fusion, in which industry designs laws and rules to thwart competition and raise profits. Using provisions of the industry-written 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Apple makes it a copyright violation for technicians to use non-Apple parts for most repairs to Apple products. The preposterous doctrine is that if an inferior non-Apple part caused the product to fail, that could reduce consumer confidence in Apple’s brand. There is even a name for this doctrine: tarnishment. TRUMP’S CONTRIBUTION TO RISING PRICES adds to these long-term abuses. Eric Winograd, a senior vice president at AllianceBernstein, calculates that Trump’s tariffs have added about one percentage point to the core inflation rate, though other estimates that account for Trump’s numerous exemptions of various products and industries put the number at 0.6 to 0.7 percent. But tariffs are only the beginning of Trump’s impact on prices. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. Internet innovators grew from purveyors of ingenuity and user convenience into extractive monopolies largely because antitrust enforcement ceased to exist from late in the Carter administration until Joe Biden’s appointments of some of the smartest students of abuses and their remedies: Lina Khan at the FTC, Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department, Rohit Chopra at the CFPB, and Tim Wu (whose latest book is reviewed in these pages) as competition policy chief at the White House. These agencies had just gotten serious about reversing four decades of corporate market power when the antitrust revolution was reversed by Trump. As antitrust enforcement has been aborted, private equity companies have been buying up traditionally local firms in order to use market power to raise prices, in sectors as diverse as pest control operations, HVAC companies, and veterinary practices In addition, Trump’s shutting down of Biden’s industrial policies has raised prices. Electric power costs have lately risen far faster than the general rate of inflation. Trump’s policy of killing renewable-energy projects, in order to raise profits for oil and gas companies, contributes to this price rise, by taking away power that might otherwise come onto the grid and alleviate demand. So does the failure to regulate the extensive use of electric power by data centers used by tech companies. There was a time when we needed to shift to solar and wind in order to help address climate change. But now that renewables are cheaper than most fossil fuels, we need to make that shift because it saves money. Instead, Trump promotes more costly oil and gas. It is hard to quantify precisely how much all of Trump’s policies taken together have added to price inflation, but a very conservative estimate would be about two percentage points. That may not sound like a lot, but it is the difference between a baseline inflation rate of 2.5 percent and a rate of 4.5 percent. And that difference is not just a hidden tax on consumers. It has knock-on effects. With inflation at 2.5 percent, the Federal Reserve is willing to reduce interest rates in order to reduce unemployment. But when price increases approach 4 percent, the Fed worries more about inflation. At a time when unemployment rates are rising, policies that raise prices tie the Fed’s hands. This paradoxically could make things more unaffordable for low-income workers, if a loose job market keeps wages from rising. It’s not clear whether there will be any more rate cuts in the near future, and there may even be rate increases. A Fed policy of tighter money means that people pay more for their mortgage loans, their credit card debt, their student loans, and consumers pay more when small businesses pay more for credit. Trump’s cuts in programs such as SNAP and Medicaid are another form of indirect price hikes; even worse, they are price hikes that hit the poor. If your food stamp allotment is reduced, you have to pay more out of pocket in order to eat. If your Medicaid is cut, you pay out of pocket or do without. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The failure to address climate change, and Trump’s reversal of long-standing policies aimed at preserving the environment, also add to costs. As destructive storms become more severe and frequent, the costs of recovery and of homeowner insurance relentlessly rise, some borne by consumers directly and some by taxpayers. This natural-world aspect of hidden inflation is addressed in another of our special articles, by Gabrielle Gurley. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE among economists and policymakers about whether the Consumer Price Index should be adjusted downward to reflect improvements in quality. A 2020 car was simply a better car than a 1980 car, so some of the nominal price inflation actually represented a superior product. Likewise coffee: In 1970, a cup of coffee only cost a dime, but the swill was undrinkable. Coffee today is a lot more expensive, but it is palatable. In practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did some minor revisions to adjust for quality improvements. Today, we might need to do the reverse. We are paying more money for products and services whose quality has deteriorated. And in many cases, the deterioration has been deliberate. Indeed, the business model of the tech giants is to systematically degrade the quality of products and services. Products are needlessly complex from the perspective of the consumer, but the complexity adds to the surveillance. Same with tech services. This is the essence of what Doctorow calls enshittification. Doctorow tells the story of how Google deliberately slowed down its search process in order to make more time for its system to festoon the search results with annoying ads that embody everything that Google knows about the user’s buying habits. In conventional economics, wages and prices are two different aspects of the economy. But whether people can afford to live decently is a function of what they earn applied to what they have to pay to live. The same technology that allows tech monopolists to gouge consumers enables them to treat workers like serfs and evade the protections of labor law. As Harold Meyerson writes in his piece, the cost of living is higher because earnings are lower. And earnings are lower because of both the weakening of the labor movement and the sidelining of the National Labor Relations Board. In addition, tech allows employers to double down on the old practice of denying that workers are payroll employees protected by labor laws. From Uber drivers and UPS contractors to chicken farmers and fast-food workers, the company controls and monitors every aspect of the work, but the employer pretends that the workers are independent contractors. This represents a toxic marriage of app technology and market power. The effect is to batter down earnings. And as Naomi Bethune writes, all of the predations tend to hit racial and ethnic minorities harder, because African Americans and Latinos are more economically vulnerable to begin with. Trump’s war on DEI only increases the vulnerability. EVEN APART FROM THE PREDATIONS of extractive and invasive capitalism, other sources of the relentless rise in prices are the result of policy failures that predate the abuses of surveillance capitalism and Donald Trump by decades. Housing is out of reach for so many Americans because America has failed to build enough houses. Houses were cheap after World War II mainly because cheap farmland was being converted to suburbia, with the help of federal highway and mortgage policies. The cheap land is gone, and homebuilder consolidation has distorted markets. Trump’s tariffs have caused a rise in building costs, and his proposal to privatize the secondary mortgage market would make financing more expensive. Housing tax breaks are tilted toward more expensive homes, and toward homeowners over renters. The sheer purchasing power of the oligarchy also bids up prices. Local regulatory barriers also raise costs, but many zoning restrictions also reflect the political power of oligarchs, who don’t want riffraff in their neighborhoods. The bipartisan failure to regulate new financial scams such as subprime mortgages added to the pressure on housing. Millions of homeowners, disproportionately Black and Hispanic, lost their homes in the wake of the subprime collapse. Congress passed legislation to allow for mortgage refinancing for duped homeowners, but the Obama administration failed to carry it out. You might think that scads of vacant and foreclosed houses would lead to lower prices via the law of supply and demand. But the same regulatory failure led private equity companies to swoop in, buy houses, and jack up prices and rents, while making homebuilders reluctant to build the additional units we need. Public policy has also failed to produce an adequate supply of affordable rental housing. The rental housing that we do subsidize is done in wildly inefficient ways, for the convenience and profit of landlords and developers. Our failure to have a true social-housing sector reflects power imbalances between oligarchs and ordinary citizens. The cost of higher education is out of sight because legislators, Republican and Democrat alike, permitted universities to inflate costs via the student loan program, and then piled debt onto generations of students and graduates. State legislatures compounded the damage by reducing direct appropriations to public universities that were free to state residents until a generation ago, substituting tuition and fees. It now costs more to attend a state university than what a private university cost when I was a student. Health care costs also keep rising because the United States has failed to adopt an efficient program of universal public health insurance, as every other major country has done. To compound the damage, policymakers have allowed a plague of for-profit middlemen to take over hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors’ practices. In many hospitals, people of means hire private nurses because the hospital’s own nursing staff is so stretched thin and overworked by cost-cutting aimed at siphoning profits. A hidden price hike, if you can afford it. If the U.S. had a universal nonprofit insurance system, it would save about 6 percent of GDP. That’s $1.2 trillion a year. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE ABUSES of capitalism were relatively straightforward and transparent. Large corporations sought to combine into monopolies. The remedy was enactment and enforcement of antitrust laws. Corporations tried to pay their workers as little as possible and to break their unions. The remedy was the Wagner Act, guaranteeing workers the right to organize and join unions. Bankers tried to swindle investors for their own enrichment. The remedy was tougher banking and securities laws, prohibiting conflicts of interest. Corporations tried to cheat consumers with tricky terms and shoddy products. The remedy was the pro-consumer legislation of the 1960s and 1970s. But today’s corporate and financial abuses are hidden in a web of algorithms and apps, reinforced by regulations that actually help tech companies cheat consumers rather than protect them. It takes a complex, deeply knowledgeable, and radical critique of capitalism as currently practiced to get serious about remedies. That does not describe about half of the current Democratic Party, which is on the take from these same industries. One of the many tragedies of Joe Biden was that he was a feeble spokesman for his own good policies. He hired the most knowledgeable people in the country to revive antitrust and apply it to new abuses. But Biden did poorly at narrating the significance of these policies to ordinary Americans coping with rising prices. As I’ve written elsewhere, many of these policies and people reflected the work of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was a superb narrator of what they meant and why we needed them. But we ended up with the soul of Elizabeth Warren in the feckless persona of Joe Biden. If we can make the heroic assumption that Trump will not be president forever, and that there will be an opportunity to pick up where Biden and Warren left off, America’s next leaders will need to be even more radical in their understanding and remediation of capitalism, which has become even more debased since Trump took office.
