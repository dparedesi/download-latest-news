Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 2021 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been unbelievably bullish in the past few months. It was supposed to be game over for Tesla once Musk had a falling out with Trump, but TSLA stock is up nearly 120% after bottoming out that spring. It is now higher than it has ever been. Musk was also “vindicated” by a recent ruling where the justices unanimously ruled to reinstate his 2018 Tesla compensation package. It overturned a 2024 decision that voided the $140 billion deal. You’d expect financials to be better than ever, but that’s not the case either. Net income kept falling, and revenue increased by only 11.57% year-over-year in Q3. This is a very modest increase for a stock trading at 219 times 2026 expected earnings. You’re paying exactly 15 times forward sales, so even top-notch margins would keep this stock at expensive levels. This begs the question: Are promises alone driving the stock? Are investors naive enough to buy into the stock in droves without at least some hard figures to reinforce their conviction? This is the hardest part to figure out, and what better way to find an answer than to ask the bulls themselves? Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla can reach $2 trillion. This is the same analyst who sees Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) becoming a $1 trillion company, but a large number of investors share his optimism. His rationale is that Tesla is in a “defining moment” due to Robotaxi and robotics. He believes AI and autonomous driving “could be worth nearly $1 trillion” and generate profits on top of Tesla’s core electric vehicle business. You don’t have to take permabull Ives’ justification for the optimism. Bank of America justified its $471 price target due to the Robotaxi and the Optimus robot. Per its own sum-of-the-parts analysis that runs through 2040, the Robotaxi platform alone accounted for 45% of Tesla’s total valuation, with the Optimus humanoid robot at 19%. TSLA stock has surged past that price target. Another long-term Tesla bull, Cathie Wood, believes 90% of Tesla’s enterprise value and earnings will come from the Robotaxi business in 2029. It is important to note, though, that Wood predicted a tenfold increase in TSLA’s price all the way back in early 2023, with the bear case at $1,400. Her justification then was full self-driving technology. All things considered, the bulls have a very mobile (pun unintended) thesis for why they see parabolic gains. If Robotaxis end up failing, Optimus or something else that may come up is very likely to take its place. Even though the numbers are not there, the bulls are putting the money where their mouth is. TSLA stock has continued climbing, and the bears have been proven dead wrong in the past year. Wood’s portfolio has Tesla as its largest holding with a 12.2% weight. In the coming quarters, Musk can start working on the numbers as the “anti-Tesla” sentiment has cooled down. Interest rate cuts will also indirectly raise demand for vehicles as they make car loans more affordable. If this coincides with a drawn-out AI rally that lasts through 2026, TSLA stock will be able to reach $2 trillion and beyond. While it’s true that Musk’s promises can get an even higher price tag in the coming quarters, chasing it is not worth it today. Tesla is highly vulnerable to a slowdown of the AI rally. Optimus’ presumed long-term potential relies mostly on AI’s progress on the software side. The robot’s chassis has been remotely controlled by a human in events. If Tesla figures out a way to make it truly autonomous, the sky is the limit. This is unlikely to happen even a decade out, but bulls will keep paying for the prospect as long as AI progress in general remains swift. If not, the dashed hopes will drag TSLA stock down with it. Then there are the Robotaxis. The potential is surely there, but so is the competition. The Waymo + Uber (NYSE:UBER) fleet is larger and more advanced at the moment. Theoretically, Tesla can still dominate if it could make millions of its FSD-capable cars into a Robotaxi fleet overnight. Paying for TSLA stock as if that has already happened is still not a good idea, at least in my opinion. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Wearables report card 2025: How smartwatches, rings, and glasses fared this year against my predictions

Smart glasses grew beyond analysts' predictions, Oura crushed rivals with patents, and Garmin charged a premium for new models. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been a dramatic 2025 for wearables. Some trends were predictable, like smart glasses continuing their exponential growth and smartwatches adding more AI and health features. But I didn't anticipate some things, like Oura lawsuits strangling its smart ring rivals or the impact of tariffs. I've decided to look back on my 2025 forecast for smart rings, glasses, and watches, including two analysts' predictions, and judge how well our collective expectations lined up with reality. Then, I'll look at the biggest wearable and fitness watch brands and grade their 2025 performance — where they succeeded and how they could have done better. As expected, Garmin tested "loyal users' willingness to buy pricier status-symbol smartwatches." The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($1.2–2K) and Venu X1 ($800) are clear examples, but even mid-rangers like the Venu 4 ($550) have become more high-end. Add in the $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3, $500 and $650 Galaxy Watches, and the $1,000 Polar Grit X2 Pro, and you can see brands normalizing phone-level prices (and offsetting tariff costs). It was also expected that there would be "more options" for thrifty consumers. The Apple Watch SE 3 qualifies, sticking to its old $250 price, but it's the exception. We saw cheap trackers from Xiaomi and CMF, but very few cheap Android smartwatches besides discounted last-gen models. Even Amazfit sold as many $300+ watches as $100 ones. Tariffs have interfered with budget options, making it more profitable to attract wealthier hobbyists. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Meanwhile, Google, Samsung, and Apple started pushing the idea of smartwatch AI in 2025. But it's still mostly on-phone processing of queries and health data analysis. The Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch S11 have on-watch AI tools like smart replies or live translation, and I appreciate how Gemini on Android watches syncs well with Google apps. I expect a bigger AI push in 2026, particularly with the Fitbit Personal Health Coach AI. Again, companies clearly want smartwatches to become medical devices, but we're still in the predictive "wellness" phase. For example, Samsung added virtual doctor's visits and prescription management while giving its watches vascular health and antioxidant index analysis, with heart failure warnings coming soon. That said, my analyst's prediction of direct blood pressure monitoring on watches in 2025 didn't happen. But Apple started offering hypertension alerts, while Fitbit and Oura launched hypertension studies — so at least we're getting warning signs for high blood pressure. As for smart rings, I don't have hard figures for 2025 yet, but IDC's current estimates show it's a tiny but growing sliver compared to fitness trackers, and growing much more slowly than smart glasses. Sales have grown, but I'm expecting the category to stagnate. Oura has leveraged its patents to demand royalty payments from every major smart ring brand, bringing Circular and RingConn to heel, successfully banning Ultrahuman from the U.S., and currently challenging Samsung. The current rumor is that Samsung won't make a Galaxy Ring 2, and there's little hope for competition and innovation in the space if brands like Fitbit and Apple decide it's not worth the legal hassle — or giving Oura a cut of the profits — to make a smart ring. Finally, IDC's Jitesh Ubrani wasn't bullish on smart glasses' future last year, saying that "most consumers don't need" the photo/ video/ music/ AI combo and that sales would only climb from 2.5 million to 3.5 million in 2025. Turns out, IDC's current forecast is 9.4 million glasses sold in 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban/Oakley partner EssilorLuxottica has ramped up production to 10 million per year, and Ubrani is much more enthusiastic about smart glasses' future. That said, 10 million sold may not qualify as "mainstream," compared to 200 million smartwatches and trackers in 2025. The Samsung AI and HUD glasses coming in 2026 should help the category continue to grow, especially internationally. Garmin launched a series of successful, high-quality watches this year: the Instinct 3 for hikers and campers, the Vivoactive 6 for thrifty indoor athletes and daily step-counters, the Forerunner 570 for runners and triathletes, the Forerunner 970 for pro-level athletes and trail runners, and the Venu 4 as the all-around best option. Unfortunately, Garmin raised watch prices across its entire lineup for extra revenue, delivering strong earnings but making them less accessible to everyday athletes. As much as I love the Venu X1, I can't recommend people spend $800 on one. From an economic standpoint, Garmin has become a top-5 brand for worldwide smartwatch sales. Despite that, Garmin's stock plummeted because its uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro couldn't compete with last year's massive Fenix 8 sales, undoing all its gains. The new Garmin Connect+ subscription, which launched this year, may have earned some profits, but Garmin fans have never embraced the feature, especially when it's required for features like Garmin Trails, extra badges, and their Year in Review summary. Unrealistic shareholder expectations aside, Garmin has had a strong year, but its tendency to price-lock the best features to Fenix-level watches is harder to stomach when the "cheaper" models are still expensive. And you never know when there'll be a major blue triangle crash. I won't grade every fitness watch brand, but I'm highlighting COROS because it's had a strong 2025 as a foil to Garmin. The COROS Nomad, Apex 4, and Pace 4 have each impressed me with their accurate GPS and HR data, weeks of battery life, affordable prices, and fast performance for trail and street maps. COROS gained some ground on its rivals with vital features: media playback controls, move alerts, undo laps, flashlight mode, cycle tracking, mid-activity voice alerts, street names and POIs on maps, and an adventure journal. Equally important, COROS updates its entire lineup, rather than price-lock features to the flagships. It makes models like the $300 COROS Pace Pro feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have. It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's 2025 end-of-year report. It won't catch up to Garmin (2nd overall) anytime soon, but COROS has earned a reputation for budget quality with serious athletes — stealing Garmin's customers. COROS's main 2025 blemish was an IT exposé revealing major security vulnerabilities on all COROS watches, letting hackers potentially access your account, snoop on notifications, and worse. COROS says it has resolved these issues, thankfully. Oura reports selling 5.5 million rings so far, with half those sales in the past 12 months. It also has a new U.S. DoD contract, which requires them to build a manufacturing facility in Texas. This deal also caused some backlash over fears Oura would share private data with the Trump administration, but CEO Tom Hale has reassured otherwise. The Oura Ring 4 continuously received new features in 2025. The LLM-powered Oura Advisor is the centerpiece, giving advice and coaching based on your ring stats. The AI Meals tool gives you a nutritional summary of your plate with a photo. Your Oura Ring can now track pregnancy and premenopause symptoms. Its Preventive Health data studies signs of cumulative stress. The list goes on! Oura also launched the Ring 4 Ceramic, a more expensive model with premium zirconia ceramic materials. While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4. Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest. That's a good business position to be in. Meta released three pairs of smart glasses in 2025, which is a significant accomplishment. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the centerpiece, and while it isn't significantly different from the original, the extra hours of battery and 3K video do make it easier to recommend. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cater specifically to the athletic crowd, particularly with the Garmin integration, and while I loved them, it'll take time to see whether they resonate because of the weight and price. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses have struck a chord with the tech niche, with some impressive HUD features that have started to live up to the Google Glass idea people have waited a decade for. They're too thick, heavy, and expensive to break out of that niche, but it's a step in the right direction. Hardware aside, Meta has done well with software updates in 2025. It added Meta AI support for several apps (Audible, Spotify, Google Calendar, Outlook, and Weather), released Live AI and Live Translation, sped up camera captures, and brought Gen 2 features like improved stabilization to the Gen 1 glasses.
