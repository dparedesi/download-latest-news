Highlights Dollar General posted net sales of $10.7 billion and net income of $411 million, beating expectations as value-driven shoppers turned to its stores amid inflationary pressures. The company plans nearly 4,900 real estate projects in fiscal 2025, including 575 new stores, 15 in Mexico, and over 4,200 remodels across its Elevate and Renovate initiatives. Dollar General paused expansion of its high-margin pOpshelf concept but continues investing in digital convenience, including expanded delivery and same-day service. Retail is being rewritten in real time as price-pressured shoppers chase value.

Δ Dollar General said during its Thursday (Aug. 28) second-quarter 2025 earnings call that its business model is finely tuned to these shifting consumer dynamics. “We are pleased with our strong second-quarter results, including earnings growth that significantly exceeded our expectations,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a Thursday press release. “Our improved execution, along with our progress advancing key initiatives, is resonating with both existing and new customers as we further enhance our value and convenience proposition.” For the 13 weeks ended Aug. 1, Dollar General reported net sales of $10.7 billion, a 5.1% increase from $10.2 billion in Q2 2024. Net income reached $411 million, up 10% from $374 million in Q2 2024. While traditionally serving lower-income households, Dollar General increasingly attracts middle- and high-income shoppers trading down amid rising costs and seeking bargain alternatives for routine needs.

Nearly 4,250 remodels will be completed across the two major initiatives. This level of construction and remodeling is unmatched in the U.S. discount sector and reflects Dollar General’s conviction that small-box convenience remains a durable retail format even in an age of eCommerce and big-box consolidation. In the three-month period representing Q2, the company opened 204 new stores, remodeled 729 locations under “Project Elevate,” remodeled 592 more under “Project Renovate,” and relocated 15 stores, the release said. Projects Elevate and Renovate are not merely cosmetic. Elevate is designed as a partial remodel that refreshes merchandising, reduces maintenance costs and enhances customer experience. Renovate involves full remodels that upgrade layouts, product selections and equipment. Both are intended to improve the balance between the company’s low-margin, high-traffic consumable goods and its high-margin, non-consumable goods. See also: Discounts Lure High-Income Customers to Dollar Stores Dollar General’s management commentary on Thursday’s earnings call illustrated the precarious environment its shoppers face. The company’s core customers are disproportionately affected by inflation, higher rent and energy costs, and resumed student loan repayments. While food and household goods sales have held up, discretionary spending in seasonal, home and apparel categories remains pressured. The sales mix underscores this tension. Consumables accounted for more than 82% of sales in Q2, rising 5% year over year to $8.82 billion, per the press release. Seasonal and home products grew more modestly, while apparel posted only slight gains. The heavy weighting toward consumables secures traffic but dampens gross margin expansion. PYMNTS Intelligence’s July Paycheck-to-Paycheck research showed that 78% of low-income households, defined as those earning less than $50,000 a year, and 66% of middle-income households, defined as those earning between roughly $50,000 and $100,000 a year, said they were living paycheck to paycheck in June. Perhaps the most telling shift in strategy involves Popshelf, Dollar General’s relatively new retail concept aimed at high-margin categories like home décor, beauty and seasonal goods. Originally envisioned as a growth vector, pOpshelf has faced headwinds in the current environment. In Q2, the company operated 180 standalone locations, but it has paused new openings in 2025, Business Back reported Sunday (Aug. 24). Some Popshelf sites are being converted back to Dollar General stores. Despite its brick-and-mortar foundation, Dollar General continues to invest in digital channels. The company partnered with Uber Eats this month to deliver household essentials. In September 2024, it launched same-day home delivery via its own app and website in select markets. That service is rolling out more broadly in 2025, positioning Dollar General to compete for convenience with grocery delivery providers and Walmart’s expansive online network. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has tracked the impact of tariffs on consumers throughout the spring and summer. For example, the June report, “Stock Out. The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability,” showed 47% of U.S. shoppers said they could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs led to supply chain disruptions or higher price tags.

Title: Serve Robotics’ Target Of Deploying 2,000 Level 4 Autonomous Urban Delivery Robots By Year End Is Now Attracting Wall Street’s Attention

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The age of robots is neigh, and the market is currently sifting through the available players to sniff out those with an intrinsic advantage. Enter Serve Robotics, whose partnership with NVIDIA and Uber demands a prominent place in the last-mile urban delivery space. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Serve Robotics is currently pioneering 4-wheeled robots that leverage AI to navigate dense cityscape. These third-gen robots support advanced sensing tech and copious onboard computing resources, thanks to NVIDIA's Jetson Orin module. Of course, NVIDIA had precipitated a significant rally in Serve Robotics' stock in 2024 when it took a 10 percent stake in the company. Interestingly, NVIDIA divested the entirety of its stake in Q4 2024. Do note that Serve Robotics is currently partnered with Uber Eats to offer autonomous food deliveries in US cities such as Los Angeles. In the second quarter of 2025, the company deployed 120 delivery robots, bringing its total fleet strength to 400. Critically, Serve Robotics intends to expand its robot fleet size by 400 percent to 2,000 units by the end of 2025. Wedbush starts Serve Robotics $SERV at Outperform with a $15 PT — about 46% upside from here. Calls out strength in its autonomous delivery platform tied to AI growth. Shares sold off after $NVDA trimmed its stake, but Uber still holds ~8% and remains a key partner. It is this aggressive growth spurt that is now attracting Wall Street's attention. For instance, Wedbush has just initiated its coverage on the stock with a $15 stock price target, implying a 35 percent upside from the current price levels. Similarly, earlier in August, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on Serve Robotics shares, replete with a $17 stock price target. Serve Robotics announced $642,000 in revenue in Q2 2025, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 46 percent. The company's strong liquidity position of $183 million (as of the end of Q2) has played an important role in aiding its hyper-aggressive expansion efforts. The company is also tapping into multiple revenue streams. For instance, it is selling advertising space on its delivery robots, allowing advertisers to gain visibility as these delivery robots become an increasingly common sight on urban walkways. Serve Robotics has a low-cost CapEx model, where it outsources the actual manufacturing of its iconic robots to Magna. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to price its delivery services at a more competitive sub-$8 price point, allowing a break-even period of less than 2 years for each robot.
