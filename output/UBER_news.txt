June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: Why Companies Need To Institute Stricter AI Policies

ByMegan Poinski andCIO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCIO, Forbes Staff. As the hype grows around AI and more people try it out, many are using it at work to see how it can help them become more efficient. But there’s a real problem: Some employees are using public instances of chatbots, putting proprietary company data at risk by giving an open LLM access. Others use the company’s access to AI, but input highly sensitive and personal data, like Social Security numbers and financial data. A new study from technology security company Kiteworks found that 27% of companies reported that nearly a third of all of the data sent to AI systems is the type of information that should be kept private, like company records, employee information and trade secrets. (It could be more; 17% of companies don’t know how much private data ends up getting sent to AI.) It’s a problem that’s growing. A Stanford University report on AI found a 56.4% increase in security incidents with the technology last year. While it may seem obvious to the tech savvy, many employees might not know the risks of this kind of AI sharing, and 83% of companies only rely on training or warning emails to let them know. Kiteworks found that just 17% have automatic controls that keep employees from uploading sensitive information to public AI tools. Further, most companies don’t have much of an AI governance structure—only 9%, according to Deloitte research cited by Kiteworks. The study results show that companies need to add policies and infrastructure to control employee use of AI and protect their own data. This kind of use can cause real damage to companies—not to mention their employees and clients. The study concludes that companies need to acknowledge the threat, deploy controls that can be verified, and ensure that they can stand up to regulatory scrutiny. “With incidents surging, zero-day attacks targeting the security infrastructure itself, and the vast majority lacking real visibility or control, the window for implementing meaningful protections is rapidly closing,” Kiteworks CMO Tim Freestone said in a statement. Many people still haven’t grasped how to truly use AI to benefit their company—we all know its practical business functions go beyond asking a chatbot for advice. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about how to bring AI to your company and get people using it. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the VivaTech technology startup and innovation fair in Paris earlier this month. Nvidia is back on top, pulling ahead of Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company. A research note on Wednesday from Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target for Nvidia’s stock from $175 to $250. Baruah wrote that Nvidia will lead the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI, and will see “stronger-than-anticipated demand.” The research note—as well as Nvidia’s annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Jensen Huang laid out an optimistic view of the company’s future—drove the company’s stock to hit a record high of $154.43. While share prices dropped somewhat before markets closed, it was a banner day for the chips company. Chips and robotics company, that is. At the annual meeting, Nvidia positioned itself squarely in the robotics and physical industrial AI spaces. In the company’s annual report, Huang wrote that so far this year, Nvidia has fundamentally transformed itself from a chip maker to a builder of infrastructure. While AI data centers will continue to be important, AI-powered robots in factories, hospitals, farms and cities will be what moves society forward in the not-so-distant future. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” Huang said at the meeting, according to CNBC. An Iranian man stands in his apartment in Tehran, which was destroyed by Israeli attacks. While it seems for now that the physical conflict between Iran and Israel—which the U.S. inserted itself into by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities—is on hold, the war will likely still be bitterly fought online. Forbes’ Thomas Brewster writes that Iran, which has a “robust cyber apparatus” according to Middle East cybersecurity experts, is likely to launch disruptive attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests. For the U.S. government, this could be especially challenging. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency has lost many experienced employees and does not even have a permanent director. Insiders told Forbes that CISA already is stretched thin, but coordinated attacks from Iran could make it much worse. The PR war over how the attacks are seen is also riddled with conflicting imagery. AI-generated Iranian propaganda showing a rocket launch and a convoy of tanks and missiles have racked up millions of views, writes Forbes’ Emily Baker-White. These videos, which were seen throughout social media, abruptly disappeared. None of the platforms have any policies against releasing propaganda, and the videos didn’t appear to be labeled as AI-generated. getty AI can be a force for good, but it can also be nefarious. New research from Barracuda, Columbia University and the University of Chicago found that AI writes more than half of all spam email now, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. This includes the vast majority of messages in your personal account’s spam folder—but it’s also getting prevalent in business emails as well. About 14% of business inbox attacks, in which often senior people in organizations are targeted with requests for financial transactions, are written by AI. Winder writes that it makes sense to use AI for spam. It tends to do a passable job of writing with proper grammar and spelling across a variety of languages. It can also write in a convincing way to provoke a recipient to respond. The study found that attackers seem to be using AI to draft different versions of spam and hacking emails, searching for the best way to get a recipient’s attention. SkyPhi Studios cofounder and COO Lindsay Phillips. AI truly can transform the way we do business, but in order for it to make a difference, employees actually need to use it. AI is unlike any other tech shift in recent years, and it can be difficult for everyone at a company to embrace it. I talked to Lindsay Phillips, cofounder and COO of tech change coaching firm SkyPhi Studios, about the best way to get your employees through these challenges. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What is the biggest hurdle that you see to widespread AI adoption in companies? Phillips: The biggest hurdle is companies approaching AI as a software shift, and AI is really a mindset shift. It’s not just about teaching people how to do the same work in a different tool. They have to completely change how they think about work, how they think about the value that they’re bringing to the workplace, how they approach their workflows. Companies that are just trying to make tools available and don’t help people understand how to use it, how to adopt it successfully and how to integrate it, are running into adoption challenges. How do you get past that roadblock? Understanding how you want people to change to use the tool. Understanding how roles and responsibilities need to change, the RACI [responsibility matrix] that’s required so that folks adopt this tool and integrate it into their workflows. You want to also make sure that leadership across the org understands that strategy. Most folks want to get guidance from their manager, so you want to leverage leadership cascades and really make sure they’re carrying that message forward and reinforcing it. The other thing that we’re seeing with companies that are successful is a community of practice: Creating ambassadors throughout the org, at the ground level, boots on the street, that are supporting their team members and adopting these tools and helping them make that mindset shift. How does the move toward AI compare to other technology shifts in the past, like moving to the cloud and increasing cybersecurity? It definitely feels like we’re driving the car while we’re building the car, so we need our team members to be very collaborative in helping us figure out how to use these tools. Experts are going to be able to tell you how AI is going to be able to make their jobs more productive and be able to help them do their work better. Leadership’s not necessarily going to know that, so it really does need to be a lot more collaborative and agile than it needed to be in the past. In the past, you find requirements, you help people adopt those new ways of working, you meet those requirements. This we’re figuring it out as we go, and it’s much more experimental. What sets the companies that are most successfully integrating AI apart? A comfort with experimentation and a certain amount of comfort with uncertainty of saying, ‘We’re going to give it a try. We’re going to see how it goes, and we’ll pivot as we need to.’ Companies that are very attached to clarity and certainty and always having the right answer are going to struggle with AI adoption. It’s not a linear straight path. It is going to be something you have to figure out as you go. What advice would you give to executives that are trying to get their employees to use AI? The more accessible we can make it, the better. There’s companies doing weekly challenges. Just start to encourage your folks to incorporate it into their daily lives. Encourage folks to share wins. You want to hear about how other people are using these tools so that it can give you ideas of how you can also use it in your day-to-day. It is a massive mindset shift. Approach it with little tiny bites that you can take to start to shift habits daily. As more companies adopt enterprise AI packages, several trends in what they are using and how are coming to the surface. Here are 10 trends that are shaping enterprise LLM use today. While part of business advancement today is all about personal branding and showing the world your expertise and strategic viewpoint, you may feel more comfortable quietly sitting in front of a screen. The good news is that you don’t have to be an extrovert. Here are some tips for shy people who want to build personal brands.

Title: BMO Capital’s AV Expert: Tesla Remains “Significantly Behind” Waymo

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. While Tesla has done its best to create a relentless hype cycle around its just-launched robotaxis, with a curated bunch of Tesla-supporting influencers receiving the first invites to test the service, and their ensuing flowery reports playing an important role in supporting Tesla's share price, the reality is much more nuanced, and lies somewhere in the middle of the sunny optimism emanating from the EV giant's quarters and the literal death knells that its opponents are sounding with an alarming frequency. Now, BMO Capital's Autonomous Vehicle (AV) expert has chimed in with a less-than-flattering view of the performance of Tesla's robotaxis over the past few days. BMO Capital's AV Expert: 'Waymo Is Miles Ahead’ We hosted an autonomous vehicle (AV) expert who previously worked at Waymo and now collaborates with policymakers to advance the AV industry. Our expert suggested that the industry is in the early innings of its commercialization… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) June 26, 2025 To wit, BMO Capital has now disclosed in its latest note that it recently hosted an AV expert who had previously worked at Waymo and currently advises governments on advancing the AV industry. While conceding that the industry was still in the "early innings" of the ongoing commercialization race, this expert boldly pronounced that Waymo was "miles ahead of the AV competition," ranking Chinese players - Baidu and Pony.ai - as distant seconds, followed by Amazon's Zoox and May Mobility. Critically, according to the AV expert, Tesla remained "significantly behind" Waymo in the rapidly heating AV commercialization race. The expert then points out that a typical driver associated with a given ride-share service undertakes between 15 and 20 rides per day. This contrasts sharply with Waymo's current cadence of between 20 and 25 rides per day. To unlock the economies of scale, however, Waymo will have to scale to 50 rides per day per vehicle, according to this expert. As a refresher, Waymo currently operates an autonomous ride-hailing service in 5 US cities via a fleet of around 1,500 Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, with each such vehicle equipped with an expensive array of sensors, including LiDAR, 360-degree view cameras, and a radar, all feeding into onboard compute resources. On the other hand, Tesla's robotaxis leverage an interconnected neural network along with cameras that are supposedly capable of counting individual photons, although some experts doubt that these cameras are capable of such a feat. Coming back, BMO Capital's AV expert concedes that the expensive LiDAR sensors, which are critical for depth perception, currently remain "a key cost constraint to scaling AVs." The expert asserts that Tesla would be at a distinct advantage if its camera-based, vision-only AV solution were to ultimately prove as effective as Waymo's multiple sensors-based approach. After only 4 days, Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin has already logged one incident of "Safety Concern", giving it a rate of 0.25/day so far. Waymo has 22 Safety Concern incidents since testing began 359 days ago (0.06/day) & 14 since service began in March (0.12/day).$TSLA pic.twitter.com/LryAHvLToX — Motorhead (@BradMunchen) June 26, 2025 We noted in a previous post that the NHTSA has now reportedly contacted Tesla after various videos recently surfaced, showing robotaxis committing various traffic violations, which include failure to adhere to lane discipline as well as speed limit violations. For context, do note that Waymo has logged fewer critical errors over its 10 million completed miles than Tesla has over the past few days, and that too, with a fleet of just 11 robotaxis operating in a geofenced area of Austin, replete with an employee stationed in the front passenger seat and supported by a dedicated team of teleoperators, who are mandated to take over in case of an emergency! Of course, despite all the hype surrounding Tesla's FSD, it is still widely considered a Level 2 autonomous driving system, as opposed to Waymo's, which is classified as a Level 4 system. Not everything is doom and gloom around Tesla, however. For one, the brokerage firm Benchmark has just hiked its target for Tesla shares from $350 to $475, citing the EV giant's demonstration of a "controlled and safety-first approach" to its robotaxis, which can speed up the regulatory approval process. Benchmark goes on to note: "We are a believer in TSLA’s camera-focused approach that is not only cost effective but also scalable." Do note that Tesla has given up the entirety of this week's gains, and is currently trading flat on a 5-day basis. Over the past month, the stock is down around 10 percent.

Title: Uber made a big change to how it prices trips. It might be the real secret to the company's turnaround.

A new study suggests that Uber pulled off quite a feat — raising fares, lowering driver pay, and increasing profits — with a subtle change in pricing. The analysis, which is based on a trove of data from a single driver, offers some insight into a strategy that the researchers say explains the company's financial turnaround. In 2022, Uber moved away from a formula based largely on the length of a trip and started rolling out what it calls "upfront pricing," which gives a price to riders and potential earnings to drivers before they accept a trip. Behind the scenes, Uber's algorithms use a variety of factors, not just the length of the trip and demand, to determine rider prices and driver earnings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has touted upfront pricing's ability to offer specific prices based on the company's data and AI analysis. "Anyone can price based on time and distance," he said during a quarterly earnings call in late 2023. "We'll be able to price out that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger dataset than anyone else in the world." These days, upfront pricing is standard in most parts of the US and many of Uber's international markets. The strategy may be the secret ingredient behind Uber's 300% stock rally over the past three years, a new study indicates. Upfront pricing has been "enabling the company to raise rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of rideshare trips, systematically, selectively, and opaquely," Len Sherman, an executive in residence and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the report released Monday. The study, which is based on about seven years of trip data from one driver, found that changes to fares and driver pay could vary by trip. Sherman's report said that Uber had come close to being a master of what economists call "price discrimination," or determining the exact maximum that riders are willing to pay — or the exact minimum that a driver is willing to accept — for a trip. The term doesn't refer to discrimination based on race, sex, or other personal characteristics, but rather discrimination based on a person's needs and desires in a particular situation. It's a concept that economists have talked about in introductory economics courses for decades, but it was largely theoretical, Sherman told Business Insider in an interview. "They cracked the nut," Sherman said. "They have the data and the algorithms and the machine learning to come closer to being able to do that than anyone else." Since implementing upfront pricing, Uber's stock price has risen nearly fourfold from a low of about 40% below its initial public offering price. In 2023, for the first time in its history, Uber reported an annual profit. The performance rally helped Khosrowshahi secure the option to buy about $130 million in additional Uber stock early last year, as part of an incentive plan. In a statement at the end of Sherman's report, Uber said its upfront pricing strategy was "designed it be transparent and fair for both riders and drivers." The company also said its pricing algorithms "do not use information about an individual rider or driver's personal characteristics." In a statement to BI, an Uber spokesperson called Sherman's findings "a tired, misleading story." When Uber first launched, the compensation model used a rate card, with pay based on the length of trips. Under upfront pricing, drivers' earnings have plummeted, even as the costs of working as a ride-hailing driver, such as gas and car maintenance, have increased, the study found. Many of Sherman's findings come from an analysis of one driver's trip data — information that Uber allows drivers to download. The information includes details about how much the driver got paid, how much Uber charged the rider, and how long each trip was. The worker whose data Sherman used was described as a "power driver." The study examined just under 25,000 trips that this driver completed while working close to full time for Uber between 2018 and February 2025. The driver saw pay cuts starting in September 2022, around the time Uber rolled out upfront pricing, the study found. Over the preceding two years, many drivers had seen their pay increase while driving during the pandemic, the report said. "We've seen this kind of narrative before — one driver's data and a lot of speculation spun into a sweeping indictment," an Uber spokesperson said. "The facts are simpler: upfront pricing is designed to increase clarity for both riders and drivers, not to manipulate them." If Uber can apply these methods to one driver, Sherman said, it has an incentive to do the same across a wide swath of its contractors. "The question, therefore, isn't whether our profiled driver is truly representative of all US drivers," Sherman wrote, "but rather, given Uber's massive profit improvement revealed by our analysis, why wouldn't Uber seek to exploit the same levers across its entire pool of over one million drivers in the US?" One Uber driver in New York state told BI he used to get more than 50% of fares when he drove for Uber. Since Uber introduced upfront pricing in his area, though, he has seen his cut — and, usually, his total pay from trips — fall, usually to less than 30% of the total fare. The driver shared screenshots and notes of payouts from his recent trips. The gap between what riders pay and what he makes becomes apparent when he strikes up conversations in his car. "They'll tell you that they paid Uber $60, and you're lucky if you get $20," the driver told BI. One of the clearest pieces of evidence for Uber's use of price discrimination came when Sherman compared his driver's rides from 2019 with those from 2024. In 2019, almost all of the driver's trips — 98% — had predictable pay based on distance, travel time, and any surge pricing that was in effect at the time. By 2024, though, that number had dropped to 77%, a sign that Uber had given itself "considerable wiggle room to maximize profits by adjusting prices and pay on every trip," Sherman wrote. The analysis focused on the driver's actual earnings and wasn't affected by fees, such as airport pickup fees, that drivers sometimes incur but Uber reimburses, Sherman said. Perhaps the biggest financial impact of Uber's upfront pricing, the study suggests, is on the percentage of each fare that the company claims — a metric known as "take rate." Uber doesn't regularly report its take rate in earnings. Sherman estimated it by comparing the rider price per mile in the data with the driver's pay. When upfront pricing began in 2022, the rides that Sherman's driver took had a take rate of about 32%. By the end of 2024, the take rate stood at about 42%. On some trips that Sherman examined, Uber took more than 50% of the fare. Sherman determined that the lack of transparency around pricing with the new model could have allowed Uber to increase take rates. How much Uber takes from each fare is a frequent topic of discussion for ride-hailing drivers and their passengers. "Drivers are obsessed with it," Sherman said. Determining how they're splitting a fare with Uber is an important factor for ride-hailing drivers who are deciding whether the job is worth it, said Sergio Avedian, an Uber driver who's a senior contributor to The Rideshare Guy, a gig driver advocacy blog and YouTube channel. "There is no other math," he said. Uber's upfront pricing also raised fares for short trips that the driver took, Sherman found. Longer trips, meanwhile, became a comparatively good deal for riders, which could have spurred riders to use Uber for longer trips instead of only quick hops around town, he said. "Uber's upfront pricing policy thus unlocked a trifecta of profit improvement: higher margins applied to higher-priced trips plus a shift to longer, more profitable trips," the report said.

Title: Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi rollout faced bumps in the road

Time Published: 2025-06-25T11:33:01Z

Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal. In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin. What's on deck Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience. Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on? Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore. But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin. The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections. The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor. The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions. While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as "Halo," involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said. The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk. At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits. Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000. Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion. 1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another. 2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying. 3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again. 1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US. 2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why. 3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable. 1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez. 2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly. 3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell presents semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, raising hopes for a more sustained drawdown in hostilities. Investors also kept an eye on Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that the central bank intends to maintain interest rates at their current levels until there is more clarity on tariff policy and its potential economic impact, despite the White House's calls for immediate rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, closing just beneath its record-high level set in February. The Dow was up 1.2%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4%. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., skyrocketed 12.1% on Tuesday to secure the S&P 500's top performance. Analysts at the research firm Benchmark lifted their price target on Coinbase stock, pointing to favorable legislative and regulatory developments and the company's initiatives to capitalize on them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the department would launch a massive advertising campaign to encourage the use of wearable health devices. Kennedy specifically mentioned the benefits of glucose monitors for patients managing diabetes. Shares of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom (DXCM) surged 9.7%. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 7.5% as the ridesharing company debuted its robotaxi service in Atlanta. Uber's partnership with Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), initially offers service in 65 square miles of Atlanta, around half the city's footprint. Carnival Corporation (CCL) posted better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter, and the cruise operator's shares sailed 6.9% higher. The company also boosted its full-year profit outlook, pointing to increases in passengers carried and passenger cruise days as well as declining costs. Shares of competitors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) also advanced. AutoZone (AZO) shares dropped 3.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, following reports that a senior vice president at the auto parts retailer had sold a stake in the company worth more than $2.5 million. Investors often view large sales by company insiders as a negative signal for a stock. Crude oil futures tumbled as optimism around de-escalation in the Middle East helped alleviate potential supply concerns. Shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) fell 3.3%, while Exxon Mobil shares (XOM) were down 3%. The potential for calming geopolitical tensions also pressured defense stocks. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dropped 3.2%, while shares of aerospace and defense peers RTX Corp. (RTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) also traded lower.

Title: Stocks Near All-Time High as Oil Prices Tumble

US stocks climbed near their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel's war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Tuesday and got back within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices fell roughly 6% and are below where they were before the Israel-Iran conflict began, the AP reports. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, says Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious. He said again in testimony delivered to Congress Tuesday that the Fed is "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." But he did indicate the next move is likely to be a cut. Asked whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, "We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later—but I wouldn't want to point to a particular meeting."

Title: Oil prices tumble, and Wall Street nears its record in a worldwide rally for stocks

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. stocks rose toward their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel’s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, following up on big gains for stocks across Europe and Asia, after President Donald Trump said late Monday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a "complete and total ceasefire." The main measure of Wall Street's health is back within 0.8% of its record set in February after falling roughly 20% below during the spring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 507 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. The strongest action was again in the oil market, where a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6% to settle at $64.37. Brent crude, the international standard, had a similar drop. The fear throughout the Israel-Iran conflict has been that it could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would pump up prices for gasoline and hurt the global economy. Iran is a major producer of crude, and it could also try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world's daily oil needs passes on ships. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." Oil prices have dropped so much in the last two days that they’re below where they were before the fighting began nearly two weeks ago. With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates because they boost the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money to buy a car or build a factory. But they could also give inflation more fuel. That threat is why the Fed has been hesitant to cut rates this year after lowering them through the end of last year. The Fed has said repeatedly that it wants to wait and see how much Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation before committing to its next move. So far, the economy seems to be holding up OK, though a report on confidence among U.S. consumers came in weaker than economists expected on Tuesday, and inflation has remained only a bit above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pushing loudly for more cuts to rates. And two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they may consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next meeting next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains more cautious, though he he did indicate Tuesday that the Fed's next move is likely to be a cut. Asked during testimony before a Congressional committee whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, “We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later – but I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” That helped Treasury yields ease in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.34% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.81% from 3.84%. On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after the cruise operator delivered a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it’s seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000. All told, the S&P 500 rose 67.01 points to 6,092.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 507.24 to 43,089.02, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 281.56 to 19,912.53. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied at least 1% everywhere from France to Germany to Japan following the announcement of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Hong Kong’s jump of 2.1% and South Korea’s leap of 3% were two of the strongest moves. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Tesla’s Robotaxis appeared to violate local traffic laws by exceeding the speed limit and swerving into the wrong lane – even as Elon Musk touted a “successful” launch of his long-delayed self-driving vehicles and shares popped as much as 11% Monday. In one video posted by investor Rob Maurer, a Robotaxi appeared to struggle navigating a left-turn-only lane, briefly crossing over a double yellow line before returning to the proper lane. A human motorist honked at the Robotaxi during the glitch. Meanwhile, Tesla investor and superfan Sawyer Merritt posted a video from his Robotaxi ride in which the driverless car accelerated past 30 mph speed limit during Sunday’s rollout in Austin, Texas. YouTuber Herbert Ong described a similar experience in his video, according to Bloomberg. “It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said in the video. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.” Bloomberg later reported the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking information from Tesla after seeing the online videos of issues on robotaxi after its debut. Despite the apparent hiccups, Tesla shares surged after a handpicked group of influencers who participated in the trial run uploaded positive reviews on X and other social media platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, raved about his experience after taking two approximately 15-minute rides in the state capital. “Going into it, we expected to be impressed but walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future,” Ives said in a note to clients. “The ride itself was completely smooth, and it was indistinguishable that the car was driverless as there was never a moment in the vehicle where we felt as if it did something irrational.” Ives maintained his “outperform” rating for Tesla’s stock and a $500 price target. The electric car maker began offering driverless rides by invitation only on Sunday, with riders charged a $4.20 flat fee — a cheeky nod to marijuana use. About 10 driverless Tesla Model Y SUVs were reportedly on the road, with company “safety monitors” on board in the front seat to oversee the trips. Bearded Tesla Guy, a social media influencer, compared the experience to “basically Uber.” Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla employee-turned influencer, said his rides were “very smooth and comfortable.” “Now Tesla needs to scale this service safely,” Mesbahi said on X. “As long as the system performance holds, they should be able to cover the US with Robotaxis virtually overnight.” Robotaxi is set to directly compete with Google-owned Waymo and Amazon-backed Zoox in the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla told US regulators that all of its answers to questions on the safety of its robotaxi deployment in Texas are confidential business information and should not be made public, according to a letter released Monday. On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to the agency’s questions about the safety of its self-driving robotaxi in poor weather among other issues. The agency said Monday that federal law “restricts NHTSA’s ability to publicly release what the companies label as confidential.” The agency added that “following an assessment of these responses and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.” On Sunday, Musk shared “super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!” “Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. Invitations circulated by Tesla said the initial Robotaxi service would be available from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM local time and limited to a geofenced area, meaning anything outside the pre-set boundaries would be off-limits. Tesla also said Robotaxi service would be limited or unavailable in the event of bad weather. Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” technology, though federal regulators and other critics have repeatedly raised safety concerns. He has suggested that autonomous driving technology can add $5 trillion to $10 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization by transforming its vehicles into an instant productive fleet. The billionaire had said the Robotaxi rollout was limited because Tesla was “being super paranoid about safety.” The debut occurred at a critical time for Tesla, whose shares have been under pressure since Musk embarked on his controversial work with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Trump had a very public falling-out earlier this month, though the two have since appeared to mend fences. With Post wires Advertisement

Title: I had a comfortable life in Big Tech, but something unsettled me. I quit to start my own company — now I feel more fulfilled.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 41-year-old Srikanth Narayan, the CEO and founder of Cache, from the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My career began in San Francisco. I've been in Silicon Valley ever since, working at both startups and Big Tech companies. In 2021, after roughly eight years working at Uber and then Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, I decided it was the right time to take a leap and become an entrepreneur. I had built a healthy financial cushion and was ready to take a risk and create a new company. I noticed a problem around Big Tech compensation — concentration risk. I saw an opportunity to help build a solution and educate employees on this risk. Entrepreneurship has been a lot harder than working in Big Tech, but I've found it far more fulfilling. Prior to founding Cache, I spent most of my career focusing on data visualization. In 2014, Uber recruited me to lead a data visualization application suite. I stayed at Uber for six years and eventually became a staff engineer. If you work at a company like Uber for a long time, a lot of your compensation is in the form of stock, sometimes outsizing your cash compensation. As the company grows and does well, your net worth grows in line with the stock. This creates wealth for the people who hold that stock, but having way too much of your net worth in a few stocks means you're taking undue risk. Take Tesla. In recent months, some people who worked at Tesla may have seen their net worth fluctuate due to the changing value of the company's stock. People tend to hold on to these massive stock positions due to inertia and because the taxes for reallocating stock can be very expensive. I joined Uber at a good time. The company mostly did well and went public in 2019. All of the wealth I had accumulated in stock became real money on the open market that I could sell or trade. However, I had a lot of low-basis stocks that would trigger a high capital gains bill if I sold them. When I joined Waymo in 2020, my Alphabet colleagues talked about similar problems. I found this issue unsettling. A steep drop in stock price at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic affected my portfolio. I hired a wealth manager to help me find solutions for concentration risk. They showed me products that help people of high net worth manage concentration risk. One option is depositing concentrated stock into an exchange fund where others have done the same, and receiving fund units in return. This method can diversify your portfolio while deferring capital gains taxes. It sounded like a great product, but none of my peers had heard of it. It seemed to only be available at private banks, and only for people of a certain net worth. From what I saw, the exchange funds required a lot of human operational coordination. There seemed to be little innovation in this area to improve efficiency. I saw a massive business opportunity. I wanted to make products like this more efficient and available more broadly. I resigned from Waymo in late 2021 to start my business, Cache, which I formally launched in March 2024. We're a specialized brokerage for people holding large stock positions. Our flagship product is an exchange fund that helps people diversify their portfolios. My experience at Uber gave me an understanding of how to turn an idea into a full-blown vision as a founder. I designed products at Uber that became widely adopted within the company. This took engineering work and entrepreneurial spirit. However, moving from corporate life to building a company myself involved a lot of learning on the job. There wasn't really a manual I could follow for building an exchange fund, so we had to do a lot of R&D. There were many steps involved, including working with the SEC and FINRA to get the right registrations, since the industry is highly regulated, and building the technical infrastructure for a brokerage system. I was one of the first users of my own product, and I invested a lot of my Uber stock in our exchange funds. Running a startup is very different from working at a Big Tech company. I'm probably working triple the time I was before. Being employed in Big Tech was a very comfortable life. You worked on challenging problems and got paid well to do it. While I enjoyed this, I also wanted to figure out my own path. The entrepreneurial journey has been more fulfilling. I've had to go through personal trials, such as not paying myself for the first year after leaving Waymo. Because of my financial cushion from working in Silicon Valley, the stress of this didn't really bear on me. I'd made sure I had several years of living expenses in reserve before taking the leap. Becoming an entrepreneur requires drive and conviction. It's a very hard journey, and often, market forces will be against you until they start working with you. The glamour of being a startup founder or of an exit is the wrong reason for forming a company. It should be about self-fulfillment and a passion for building something from scratch and making a change in the world. Do you have a story to share about leaving Big Tech?

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement These go-to Alexa commands save time, simplify tasks, and make daily life easier. If you have the latest Echo Dot with Clock, you can start using these voice commands today. Alexa has come a long way since its early days as a basic voice assistant. What once felt like a novelty for playing music or checking the weather is now a powerful tool for managing your entire home. With the launch of Alexa Plus and its new AI-powered features, Amazon's voice assistant is smarter and more capable than ever before. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a must-have tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now is the perfect time to see how much more useful it has become. with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.
