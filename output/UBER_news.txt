Palantir CEO Alex Karp talks a big game when it comes to his employees. He's boasted on several occasions that Palantirians, as the company refers to employees, are the crème de la crème of tech workers. "If you work for Palantir, everyone knows you're good," Karp said on CNBC's Squawk Box on February 18. "No credible institution in commercial life can really be built without Palantir or an ex-Palantirian," Karp has also said. The company, which reported just under 4,000 full-time employees as of December 2024, recently hit an all-time high in its stock and brought in $2.87 billion in revenue in 2024. Following its most recent earnings report, Palantir hit a $240 billion market cap, surpassing companies like McDonald's and Disney. It hasn't only been clear skies, however, as Palantir's share price is down nearly 30% from its all-time closing high earlier this month. So do the people hiring from the tech talent pool buy Karp's glowing view of Palantirians? Business Insider spoke to half a dozen tech recruiting professionals to find out if having Palantir on your résumé is as powerful as Karp has made it sound. Deepali Vyas, a senior Partner and global head of data, AI, and FinTech at global consulting firm Korn Ferry told BI she can "absolutely say that he's right," and she considers Palantir the Goldman Sachs of the tech industry. "I've pulled people from Palantir," Vyas said. "They are a home run every single time." While she said Palantir employees tend to work long hours, the company has a "very hands-on culture" that allows even junior employees to work alongside the "brightest minds" at the company. Vyas said having that proximity helps create a certain level of training. Vyas said another factor that makes Palantir stand out is its ability to recruit people who are passionate about their work. "There's something in the sauce there," Vyas said. "They want to work on the complex problems because that's what excites them." Jason Saltzman, Director of Growth at Live Data Technologies, a company that tracks employment changes, told BI that "Palantir seems to be the stop on people's career journey that accelerates them the most." Almost a quarter of former product managers at Palantir have since become founders, he said. Ex-Palantir employees also tend to end up at a big tech company or "one of the hottest startups," Saltzman said. Google and Meta as well as Anduril and OpenAI employ many former Palantir workers, he told BI. "Not only is Palantir a rubber stamp on someone's résumé that allows them to go onto whatever they do next, but also many of them want to go solve the world's biggest problems that are shaping the future as we know it, either by joining a company or starting their own," Saltzman said. Aaron Sines, director of technical recruiting at global cloud consulting firm Edison & Black, told BI that there's some truth to Karp's statement, but overall he's seeing a "results revolution" among companies, where outcomes are placed above academic credentials and company names. "My team tells me all the time results are almost always coming over academic credentials," Sines told BI. Natan Fisher, the cofounder and co-CEO of tech and legal recruiting firm SingleSprout, similarly told BI that companies want to know how employees "operated under constraints, and whether they can drive impact in their environments." "No doubt, Palantir is a strong hiring signal, but the idea of a golden ticket in tech is outdated," Fisher said, adding that "the real hiring market doesn't reward brand names alone, it rewards execution and adaptability — who built what and scaled systems at speed." Fisher said that tech companies often seek to hire from "multiple high-caliber" talent pools such as Ramp, Stripe, Linear, and Notion, adding that they aren't clients of his. Sines said that Palantir has a reputation for seeking out top talent and having a "rigorous" and "results-oriented" hiring strategy. However, he said that while it carries a "badge of honor," for some clients, it may signal too much intensity for others. It depends on how companies perceive culture, Sines said. Farah Sharghi, a job search coach and former recruiter at tech companies including Google, Lyft, Uber, and TikTok, said that while Palantir's hiring process is "very stringent," a good employee at Palantir may not be a good employee everywhere else because "there might be some nuances to some companies versus others in terms of cultural fit." "A Palantir engineer who's used to working on some particular type of technology might not thrive in another different size company or different cultural company," Sharghi said. "So it's really subjective relative to what the company does, what their needs are, and so on." While culture may vary across tech companies, Sharghi says the guiding philosophy when it comes to hiring is largely the same across the board. "They're not looking for breadth of experience," she said. "They're looking for technical depth of experience." Alan Stein, the CEO of career-accelerating service Kadima Careers, told BI that "Palantir is a good brand name," but although it was considered, it didn't make his list of the top 100 companies that will accelerate your career. "I don't think that's as impressive as some of the other companies," he said. Stein, who has worked at several Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta, said that while Palantir candidates can definitely leverage their experience into data, engineering, or government roles, it doesn't have the same brand recognition as some other bigger companies, or Ivy League institutions like Harvard. "My hunch is more people would prefer four years of Harvard on their résumé," Stein said. Jump to

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Uber Ever Deliver? Part Thirty-Five: What Drove Uber’s Recent $8 Billion P&L Improvement?

Yves here. Hubert Horan summarizes the state of play with Uber after 2024. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016. Horan has no financial links with any urban car service industry competitors, investors or regulators, or any firms that work on behalf of industry participants. Uber and Lyft both reported full year GAAP profits for 2024. Both companies reported their 2024 financials earlier this month. After correcting the results for known issues, this paper will explain how Uber achieved an $8 billion P&L improvement after losing $33 billion in its first 13 years. It will also discuss the huge divergence in Uber/Lyft stock performance, and why neither stock improved after releasing strong 2024 P&L results. It will also cover why autonomous vehicles—a business both companies abandoned—have once again become a major focus. Uber Is Earning Small Profits but Continues to Mislead Investors About its Financial Performance Uber had an operating profit of $2.8 billion and an operating margin of 6.4% in 2024. This was up from $1.1 billion (3.0%) in 2023, the first year Uber ever reported profits. It reported a 2024 net profit of $9.8 billion (22.4% margin; up from $1.9 billion (5.1%) in 2023) but, as will be discussed below, badly misrepresents the actual 2024 performance of its ongoing operations As this series has documented, Uber includes multi-billion dollar items in its quarterly/annual operating results that have nothing to do with the current performance of ongoing business operations, and makes no effort to lay out the actual P&L of ongoing operations. Uber’s most dubious practice is including its estimate of the changes of value in untradeable securities it received after shutting down operations that had been hopelessly unprofitable These include shares in larger companies that had driven Uber out of the market (Didi in China, Yandex in Russia, Grab in Southeast Asia) and in Aurora, which acquired Uber’s failed autonomous vehicle development efforts. This practice dates to its IPO prospectus, when it used the alleged appreciation of untradeable securities to inflate its bottom-line 2018 profitability by $5 billion, in the hope of creating the impression of robust, rapidly improving profitability. [1] Uber’s 2024 and 2023 “net profitability” were each inflated by $1.8 billion thanks to the claimed value of paper associated with discontinued operations. $6.4 billion of Uber’s fourth quarter 2024 bottom line was due a tax valuation release. Thanks to Uber’s staggering 2010-23 losses (over $33 billion) it had deferred tax assets it could not report until there was some reasonably likelihood of positive income to offset. Uber claims it has over $41 billion in deferred tax assets, primarily from net operating losss carryforwards, research and development credits and from fixed and intangible assets where the tax basis exceeds book value.[2] Presumably Uber’s 4Q 24 $6.4 billion claim accords with IRS regulations. The issue is how investors are supposed to interpret Uber’s 2024 P&L. Its SEC filings include a one sentence footnote mentioning the tax valuation release but do not explain where it came from, what specific events triggered the 4Q 24 claim, why it was $6.4 billion, or whether investors should expect similar tax asset impacts in the future. And while Uber could not report the $6.4 billion until specific criteria had been met, it obviously has nothing to do with Uber’s 4Q 24 business performance. Uber faced a similar problem when it recorded $5 billion in stock based compensation expense as a 2Q 19 event, even though it covered work performed over multiple years. Then, as now, Uber’s published financials made no attempt to isolate these items so investors could not determine the true P&L results for current periods. The graph above illustrates the gap between Uber’s reported net profit margin, and a net margin corrected to only include items related to its ongoing business operations during the reported time period. Uber overstated current P&L performance by 18 points in 2024 and 5 points in 2023, and overtime Uber rendered GAAP net profitability meaningless for any investor that was trying to track profit improvement over time. Even when Uber was producing massive losses its P&L did not have the huge volatility that its reported numbers suggested. Uber produced meaningless GAAP net profit numbers because they wanted investors and other outsiders to focus on its even more bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” metric, which measures neither EBITDA nor profitability.[3] Since 2019 Uber has excluded over $21 billion of expenses from this “EBITDA Profitability” metric other than interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This practice allows Uber PR to claim a “profit margin” 10-12 points higher than its corrected GAAP net margin in the last three years. Prior to the pandemic when Uber was desperate to mask how far the company was from GAAP breakeven it was claiming a profit margin 24-32 points higher. This PR strategy has been successful. Media and financial analyst reports almost exclusively evaluate Uber profitability based on the bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” and only mention reported GAAP net profits in passing. Additionally, Uber’s SEC reporting is designed to make it impossible for outsiders to determine what drove observed changes to bottom line results. Uber only publishes a single demand metric (“trips”) making it impossible to determine the relative growth rates by product (car services and food delivery) or geographic markets or to determine how unit costs and unit revenues have changed. This measure does not distinguish between a 10 block trip and a 50 mile trip. Uber also makes it very difficult to evaluate changes in how gross customer payments are split between Uber and its drivers. A first approximation of driver revenue can be gleaned by subtracting “Uber Revenue” from “Gross Revenue” but most driver bonuses and incentive payments are buried within Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” and “Sales and Marketing” expense lines. Uber also never isolated expenses related to potential future lines of business (e.g. autonomous vehicles, freight, flying cars) so one could not accurately identify the cost of its current operations. While Miniscule, 2024 Saw Lyft’s First-Ever Reported Profit. Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data.

It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers.

[6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices.

The figure breaking down the P&L over time shows that Uber has become profitable based on the author’s adjustments in ’24. From the tone of the article, I was expecting some negative earnings bomb based on the lead-in. I can tell you with certainty that the Wall Street models are backing out all of Uber’s balance sheet and income statement esoterica to derive the same figures the author shows here. There was a strong bear case against Uber ever becoming profitable in ’21-22, and those people have essentially been proven incorrect, all accounting dodginesss aside, and anyone who was short the stock felt a ton of pain. The discussion of the labor-capital dynamic required to make that shift is, to me, a separate discussion from Uber’s dubious practices in how they represent profits. Investors have sadly not pushed them enough to remove some obfuscations, but again, a separate issue for me than the core one at hand of how profitable Uber is as a business. The other part glossed over is that drivers will often work for both Lyft and Uber taking whichever fare is best, at least in large markets. Obviously in smaller markets, Uber is more dominant being so much larger than Lyft, but those are typically places where, at least in the States, there were no meaningful taxi presence pre-ride sharing. So whatever maintenance is being paid by the drivers, that overhead is covering the cost of collecting fares from both companies, not just one. In big metros like NYC where I’m based, nearly every driver takes rides from either service interchangeably. Far be it from me to defend Uber, but I think it’s worth bearing those two things in mind. Like it or not (I personally avoid Uber if possible, and generally try to use public transit or take Lyft or a cab when I must) Uber is now a real, profitable business, and barring some unionization/regulatory changes to the industry it’s likely to remain so in the future. So going forward this pig will have the confidence to ditch the lipstick (accounting shenanigans) it used for years to punch above its attractiveness class? Will it now face the world unembelllished and unadorned? It may be a real, profitable business now but the reality is the narrative Uber ran with to seduce investors into shovelling money into its coffers hasn’t been realized. I vividly remember the pitch being about replacing car ownership entirely (with the company saying their TAM was the entire global urban mobility market), that part has entirely disappeared from its story and they failed in sweeping competitors off the deck in several key markets. Maybe i’m being a little harsh, perhaps the glass half full version is that they shot for the stars and landed on the moon. Yes, basically. This piece reads like the bear cases from 3-4 years ago but fails to adequately acknowledge how things have changed. That doesn’t make it bad; on the contrary I think the analysis and fact finding is quite good, which is why I engaged and left a comment. There’s certainly a battle to be fought over the labor-capital dynamic in Uber and nearly every other large multinational on Earth, but I worry about whether the percieved disconnect between the facts and the tone of this takedown are doing a service to that movement. Thanks for the continued reporting on Uber. Something tells me that one day that you would like to report the final death throes of Uber and gather all your essays into a book ready to print about all the shenanigans that kept this unkillable monster going for so long. I was thinking the other day that Ed Zitron is to OpenAI what Hubert Horan is to Uber. I read Ed’s latest – There Is No AI Revolution – https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/ Hubert’s articles on Uber popped in mind especially when I read the parts of about how OpenAI is continually losing money and is essentially subsidizing free and paid subscribers. I figured eventually investment into UBER by the big players was the attractiveness of the deregulation and wreckage of labor rights that followed wherever the company touched down. The throwing money at AI that is losing money…the long game is coming into focus as the games in DC and with other governments are played out. Always enjoy these as the magicians tricks are so interesting – as brazen disregard of conventions are awarded more and more often – in so many arenas – to benefit a few. Isn’t one of Ubers and Lyfts primary risks interest rates? Not for themselves but for their drivers and their ability to secure new vehicles at a lower cost – which also provide warranty repairs – for a time? There doesn’t seem any capture of “fleet age” and I wonder as time passes whether the cars being used will be older and less mechanically sound and more grungy. Another apparent profitability ploy by Uber, anyway, is reduction in customer service levels. A recent personal experience highlighted this when there the help funnel led to no way to report algorithmic errors, only driver, vehicle or safety complaints. And there was zero way to back out once a path was selected, nor any way to actually interact with a person, let alone an AI agent to discuss the problem. Whi I felt purposely and intentionally trapped. And resorting to X/Twitter was also of no use as my issue was immediatky dismissed (with a nice apology of how much they care) but no offer of appeasement as I had experienced before. This is all market power in action, I suppose. “-to benefit a few” Nowadays my pmc adjacent contacts have their hair on fire about elon when they continue to be all in on autonomous this or that predating on anything they can get their grubbies on… from the above… Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. First they came for the gypsies… Uber’s business model is built around skirting a number of laws and regulations that protect its customers and its quasi-emploees. I’d rather pay the rentier “licence holders” or “medallion holders” than set foot in an Uber. Same goes for Lyft and AirBnB. Thank you. I had been wondering about this and hoping for an update. They do seem to have become profitable, albeit not by nearly as much as their results suggest and not to a level that would make them a particularly attractive investment. Still, it’s more than I expected given the previous columns. What I’m not sure about is why Uber has been able to maintain dominance despite no longer offering a cost advantage (I don’t know this for sure but it seems to be the case anecdotally, and the article appears to confirm it). Part 2 of the series argued that Uber has a higher cost structure than traditional operators and that there are no economies of scale to be had, and predicted that Uber would have to stop lowballing and give up its price advantage – which appears to have happened now. So what’s stopping competitors from simply undercutting them on price and gaining market share that way? Is it a de facto cartel situation where nobody wants to attract Uber’s ire, and so they all price match? Or does Uber have enough of a brand now that customers are just willing to pay more for the name, a la Coke? Your email address will not be published.

Title: 5 accessories to supercharge your Arduino projects

With their cheap price tags, massive I/O provisions, and low power consumption, microcontrollers like the uber-popular Arduino family have diverse use cases, from simple automation projects to full-on DIY robots and complex electronics circuits. While you can technically run a handful of useful scripts on your MCUs, their utility goes up a notch once you pair them with sensors, breadboards, and a host of other peripherals. But if you’re just starting out, here’s a quick list of the most useful components for your Arduino boards. From DIY 3D printers to FPV drones, there's a lot you could do with your Arduino microcontroller Often mistaken for microcontrollers by beginners, SBCs are more powerful than their MCU brethren. Rather than being featured in DIY plans involving heavy circuitry, Single-Board Computers are often used in computing and programming projects. But that doesn’t change the fact that these tiny boards can enhance the functionality of your Arduino-based tinkering ideas. For instance, you can pair your custom-built gamepad with a retro gaming war machine of an SBC. Alternatively, you can turn your tiny computing board into a Home Assistant hub and pair it with your arsenal of microcontrollers to automate every aspect of your living space. Heck, if you’re unable to access your PC, you can even turn a makeshift Raspberry Pi laptop into a dedicated Arduino programming machine! If you want to dabble in circuit components without soldering everything onto your microcontroller, you’ll have a blast with breadboards. For the uninitiated, breadboards let you interface your microcontrollers with motors, sensors, and other electronic equipment in temporary setups. Besides helping you test prototypes of your wacky Arduino ideas, breadboards ensure your components can be reused once you’re done building a project. Want to build a complex circuit-based project with your SBC or microcontroller? Breadboards can make your life a lot easier! You’ll also need some jumper cables to interface the different parts of your Arduino project with the breadboard. While certain boards, like the Uno series, need a male-to-female wire, others, such as the members of the Nano family, can be directly plugged into the breadboard. Likewise, you may need male-to-male cables for the sensor modules. Ideally, you’d want to grab a set of different jumper wires, so you’re well-equipped to work on any project. While breadboards are perfect for testing your boards, sometimes, the situation calls for a more drastic, soldering approach. Perhaps you want to design compact circuits that don’t take up half your workbench. Or maybe your sensor modules won’t work unless you hardwire the different pins onto the ICs. A soldering kit is quite handy in these situations. While it may seem a bit intimidating at first, most consumer-grade solder equipment is fairly easy to work with, and with enough practice, you’ll be hardwiring your Arduino projects in no time! Capable of creating fully-customized parts for your DIY projects, a 3D printer is an amazing investment for any Arduino lover. Whether it’s mechanical components for your robotics projects, cases to safeguard your Arduino from accidental spills, or random decorations to cheer you on while you spend hours tinkering with MCUs, a 3D printer can make them all. Unfortunately, your wallet won’t be the only casualty when buying a 3D printer. If you want to design precise components for your Arduino setups, you’ll have to sink quite a bit of time into learning a CAD utility. Finally, your Arduino toolkit will be incomplete if you don't purchase some sensor and circuit modules. After all, you can’t build a precise weather station without a BME280, DHT22, DS18B20, or another temperature sensor. Likewise, ultrasonic and IR modules are indispensable for robotics projects. For folks into electrical circuits, you can stock up on resistors, LEDs, and capacitors. But if you’re into automation, it’s a good idea to grab a couple of motors and relay modules for your tiny microcontroller. Really, the sky’s the limit when it comes to inexpensive MCU add-ons! Your palm-sized Raspberry Pi can help you keep tabs on the temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity values of your surroundings If you’re still looking for other cool accessories to add to your Arduino collection, I’ve got a couple of recommendations. Multimeters and potentiometers can come in handy for your circuitry projects. You’ve also got terminal shields and breakout boards, which can extend the functionality of your Arduino. Then there's the Arduino MCU itself, and you'll be surprised at the sheer number of models circulating in the market. Heck, you can even save a few bucks by going with a third-party board, though you might end up with cheap components if you play the clone roulette. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved This thread is open for discussion. Be the first to post your thoughts. I never thought I'd use a pen again Is a flash-only NAS better than mechanical hard drives? I repurposed an old iPad and converted it into a mini Windows laptop. Here are some reasons why you should consider upgrading from mechanical hard drives to SSDs for your NAS Think twice before building a home lab These devices might be wildly popular, but I still don't see the point

Title: What is Jeff Bezos' net worth?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week The Amazon tycoon and third richest person in the world made his fortune pioneering online retail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the most recognizable members of an uber-wealthy global elite. As the owner of the Washington Post since 2013, he is also a frequent target of critics on both sides of the American political divide. Like many of the world's most fabulously wealthy, Bezos' path to riches was greased with family wealth — but it was Bezos' vision that turned an online hub for used books in the early internet era into a world-best market hegemony powerful enough to muscle out competition in virtually any field over the course of 30 years. In large part because Amazon delivery trucks are a ubiquitous presence on America's streets, Bezos has since accumulated enough wealth to be richer than many of the world's countries. Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. After college, Bezos went to work for a financial technology startup, Fitel, before moving to banking and then to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990, where he was "tasked with researching potential business opportunities involving the then brand-new internet landscape," said CNBC. There, he would show "many of the idiosyncratic qualities his employees would later observe at Amazon," including "constantly recording ideas in a notebook he carried with him," said Brad Stone in an excerpt from his 2013 book "The Everything Store."

Bezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left the hedge fund to start the organization that would become Amazon in 1994, initially operating it out of a Seattle garage. Originally called "Cadabra," the name "later changed because it sounded too much like "cadaver," or a dead human body used for research," said Yahoo. Amazon.com was launched in 1995 as an online bookseller and a year later it was considered one of the "well-established internet shops" pressuring brick-and-mortar retailers like Barnes and Noble as well as smaller, independent bookstores, said The New York Times in 1996. Amazon "survived early prophecies of doom" and eventually "branched out into selling music, movies, electronics and toys during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s." The company struggled through, but ultimately survived, the e-commerce crash of the early 2000s. Bezos took the firm public in 1997, and due to a rapid increase in the company's value, he "appeared on Forbes list of America's 400 wealthiest people for the first time in 1998," said Yahoo Finance, with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion at the time. He would never again fall out of the exclusive billionaire club. Yet Amazon itself would not develop into the market-dominating behemoth it is today until much later. As late as 2004, it was "still mostly selling just books and DVDs," even as it was "under siege from multiple sides" including retailers like Best Buy, said Vox. That is when Bezos' firm launched the company's Prime subscription service, a "$79-a-year loyalty program that includes free two-day shipping on any order," said CNN. The yearly subscription fee kept shoppers in the Amazon universe, and eventually made making purchases on the site so easy as to be near-seamless. Today, "75% of Americans now use Amazon Prime, a record level of penetration," said Business Insider. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and the billionaire space race What is Donald Trump's net worth? Is the US becoming an oligarchy? Over the years, Amazon continued to add innovative new products that disrupted existing industries, including the Kindle, a digital reader that "dominated every corner of the ebook industry" and today "might as well be synonymous with ebook, with its massive reach that accounts for 68% of overall" market for electronic book sales, said Book Riot. But it is Amazon's dominance of the global package shipping market, driven by Prime subscribers, that has made Bezos one of the richest people in history. Bezos "built the sprawling logistics and delivery empire" necessary "for many of us to buy almost anything we want with a click," said Vox. The company's labor practices and market dominance have been the target of regulatory investigations. Conditions in the company's warehouses have also drawn "scrutiny from government officials, labor groups and workers over high injury rates for the past several years," said The Guardian. Perhaps not coincidentally, in 2024 Amazon argued in a legal filing "that the "National Labor Relations Board was unconstitutional," said The New York Times. Amazon's global network of warehouses, fulfillment centers and delivery services "is the envy of, and inspiration for, Amazon's business partners and competitors," said Vox. Amazon is also one of the largest private employers in the country and in February 2025 "dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever," said CNBC. Amazon's market cap is an astonishing $2.36 trillion, according to Forbes. As his Amazon empire grew larger and larger, Bezos became involved with a variety of other ventures. In 2005, he created Bezos Expeditions, a venture capital and investment fund "through which he owns stakes in many companies including space-transportation startup Blue Origin," said The Wall Street Journal. In 2013, he bought the Washington Post for $250 million in cash, a maneuver which "stunned the media industry and sent shockwaves around Washington D.C.," said Politico. Bezos promised staff "that his ownership would bring no radical change to the paper's core values." In 2017, after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, Bezos added "Democracy Dies in Darkness," a "dramatic and alliterative phrase," beneath the paper's digital masthead, said the Post. The paper "lost $77 million" in 2023 and has "seen a dramatic 50% drop in audience since the highs of 2020," said CNN. In 2024, Bezos pulled the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering an exodus of tens of thousands of subscribers as well as a number of staff. Bezos' net worth took a hit from one of the world's most expensive divorces. In 2019, he and MacKenzie Scott announced that they were splitting. As part of the settlement, "Bezos handed Scott a 4% stake in Amazon, transferring a total of $38 billion in shares into her name," said the Independent. Bezos was, at the time, the world's richest man, and even shaving $38 billion off of his fortune left him with $119 billion. It would not be long before the external shock of a global pandemic helped his fortune recover. The Covid-19 pandemic "disproportionately padded the wealth of the richest," including Bezos, said The Guardian. As the demand for delivery services skyrocketed during the acute phase of the pandemic, Amazon's value soared, as did Bezos' net worth. Amazon's stock price went from just under $91 a share on February 28, 2020 to more than $173 a share in mid-October of 2020. Bezos' net worth jumped to more than $200 billion in 2021 but marginally declined to $196 billion by March 2024, said Yahoo Finance. That still made him the second-richest person in the world. Forbes, on the other hand, pegs his net worth at $233.1 billion as of February 21, 2025, which ranks him third on the list of the world's wealthiest people, with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg taking second place.

Reviews ethics statement With the right commands, your Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices can control your smart home, stream music, automate everyday tasks, and much more. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is much more than just a talking tablet. In fact, like Siri on your iPhone, Alexa can do way more than you probably realize. Playing your go-to Spotify playlist or checking the weather forecast is just the tip of the iceberg. With simple voice commands, Alexa can control your Fire TV devices, streamline your daily routines, and turn your home into a fully automated smart haven. Want to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try. Alexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the "Let's chat" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out. Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs. This story is periodically updated.
