November 24, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide Inc. (“WeRide” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: WRD, HKEX:0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Financial and Operational Highlights Global Commercialization - Robotaxis Tier-1 Cities, China Abu Dhabi, UAE Zurich, Switzerland Other Global Cities Global Commercialization – Other L4 Product Lines One-Stage End-to-End L2+ Solutions Management Commentary Tony Han,WeRide's Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In 3Q 2025, WeRide's regulatory and commercial achievements spanning eight countries demonstrated the convergence of advanced technology and global execution capabilities. We've achieved a number of significant milestones, most notably securing the fully driverless commercial robotaxi permit in Abu Dhabi, with our operations there soon reaching unit economics breakeven, a critical milestone that validates our path to profitability at scale. As we progress toward our goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of robotaxis by 2030, WeRide is well-positioned to capitalize on the autonomous driving opportunity. The depth of our technology stack, breadth of our global partnerships, and strength of our regulatory relationships position us to capture significant value as autonomous mobility transforms transportation worldwide.” Jennifer Li, WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of International, added, “Our Q3 financial performance represents substantial improvement in both growth trajectory and operational leverage. Revenue reached RMB171.0 million, representing 144.3% year-over-year growth, while the 761.0% increase in robotaxi revenue provides strong validation of our technology from both third parties and end users. Our diversified portfolio across products, services, and geographies continues to provide multiple avenues for sustained growth. Our gross margin expansion to 32.9% demonstrates our platform’s improving efficiency as we scale. Our Hong Kong dual primary listing, supported by reputable institutional investors globally, strengthens our balance sheet and establishes WeRide as an attractive public investment opportunity in autonomous driving.” Unaudited Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Revenues Total revenue grew 144.3% YoY to RMB171.0 million (US$24.0 million) in 3Q2025, compared to RMB70.0 million in the same period of 2024. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB114.7 million (US$16.1 million) compared to RMB65.5 million in the same period of 2024. The increase of cost of revenue was mainly due to (i) an increase in cost of goods sold, aligned with the sales increase; and (ii) a slight increase in costs of services, affected by an increase in costs of intelligent data services, partially offset by a decrease in costs of ADAS research and development (R&D) services. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit was RMB56.3 million (US$7.9 million) compared to RMB4.6 million in the same period of 2024, and gross margin was 32.9% compared to 6.5% in the same period of 2024. There were certain ADAS R&D service projects in 3Q2024 that incurred higher-than-expected costs, along with inventory write-downs. As no such items occurred in 3Q2025, both gross profit and gross margin recorded a significant YoY increase. Furthermore, certain ADAS R&D service projects with better margin profile further contributed to the increase of overall gross margin in 3Q2025. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were RMB435.8 million (US$61.2 million) compared to RMB895.7 million in the same period of 2024. Net Loss Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per ADS2 Balance Sheet Other Corporate Developments Exchange Rate Information This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.1190 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2025. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights. The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Conference Call Information The Company’s management team will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, November 24, 2025 (or at 9:00 PM Beijing Time on Monday, November 24, 2025).

Title: Analyst who called the dot-com bubble says Americans are turning a deaf ear to AI warnings—and a worse meltdown than 2008 looms

Full Content:
Albert Edwards, the outspoken global strategist at Société Générale—a figure who even refers to himself as a “perma bear”—is certain that the current U.S. equity market, driven largely by high-flying tech and AI, is experiencing a dangerous bubble. (Société Générale, to be clear, does not hold the view that U.S. stocks or AI stocks are in a bubble, noting that Edwards is employed as the in-house alternative view.) While history often repeats itself, Edwards warned recently that the circumstances surrounding this cycle’s inevitable collapse are fundamentally different, potentially leading to a deeper and more painful reckoning for the economy and the average investor. “I think there’s a bubble but there again I always think there’s a bubble,” Edwards told Bloomberg’s Merryn Somerset Webb in a recent appearance on her podcast Merryn Talks Money, noting that during each cycle there is always a “very plausible narrative, very compelling.” However, he was unwavering in his conclusion: “It will end in tears, that much I’m sure of.” Edwards told Fortune in an interview that previous theories about a bubble were “very convincing in 1999 and early 2000; they were very convincing in 2006–2007.” Each time, he said, the “surge in the market was so relentless” that he just stopped talking about bubbles, “because clients get pissed off with you repeating the same thing over and over again and being wrong,” only to change their tune after the bubble bursts. “Generally, when you’re gripped by a bubble, people just don’t want to listen because they’re making so much money.” As he himself frequently points out, Edwards is known as a very bearish market strategist who has made some high-profile and dramatic predictions, often warning about major stock market crashes and recessions. His track record includes famously calling the dotcom bubble, but it also includes warnings that haven’t panned out, such as predicting a potential 75% drop in the S&P 500 from peaks—worse than the 2008 Financial Crisis lows. When the New York Times profiled Edwards in 2010, it noted that the chuckling, Birkenstocks-wearing analyst had been predicting a Japan-style stagnation for U.S. equity markets since 1997 (a prediction he repeated in his interview with Fortune). Still, Edwards insists that the current parallels to the late 1990s Nasdaq bubble are clear: extremely rich valuations in tech, with some U.S. companies trading at over 30x forward earnings, justified by compelling growth narratives. Just as the TMT (technology, media, telecom) sector attracted vast, sometimes wasted capital investment in the 1990s, Edwards argued that today’s enthusiasm echoes that earlier era. There are two key differences that could lead to a much worse outcome this time, though. In previous cycles, Edwards explained, the catalyst for a bubble’s demise was usually the monetary authority’s tightening cycle—the Federal Reserve hiking rates and exposing market froth. This time, with the Fed lowering rates, that trigger is conspicuously absent. Bank of America Research has noted the rarity of central banks cutting rates amid rising inflation, which has occurred just 16% of the time since 1973. Ominously, BofA released a note on the “Ghosts of 2007” in August. Instead of tightening, Edwards anticipates the Fed will move away from quantitative tightening and likely shift to quantitative easing “quite soon” because of issues in the U.S. repo markets, another ghost from the Great Recession. The Fed itself issued a staff report in 2021 on repo issues, writing in 2021 that trading between 2007 and 2009 “highlighted important vulnerabilities of the U.S. repo market.” Repo issues reemerged in the pandemic, with the Richmond Fed noting that interest rates “spiked dramatically higher” starting in 2019. Edwards told Bloomberg that the absence of hawkish policy could lead to a “further melt-up,” making the eventual burst even more damaging. Poking fun at himself, Edwards said, “I just got bored being bearish, basically rattling my chains saying, ‘This is all a bubble; it’s all going to collapse.’” He said that he can see how the bubble can actually keep going for much longer than a perma bear like himself would find logical, “and actually that’s when something just comes out the woodwork and takes the legs from out from under the bubble.” “What’s more worrying about the AI bubble,” Edwards told Fortune, “is how much more dependent the economy is on this theme, not just for the business investments, which is driving growth,” but also the fact that consumption growth is being dominated far more than normal by the top quintile. In other words, the richest Americans who are heavily invested in equities are driving more of the economy than during previous bubbles, accounting for a much larger proportion of consumption. “So the economy, if you like, is more vulnerable than it was in the ’87 crash,” Edwards explained, with a 25% or greater correction in stocks meaning that consumer spending will surely suffer—let alone a 50% lurch. Edwards told Bloomberg he was concerned about the widespread participation of retail investors who have been dragged into the market, encouraged to “just buy the dips.” This belief that “the stock market never goes down” is dangerous, Edwards warned, arguing that a 30% or even a 50% decline is very possible. The inequality of American society and the heavy concentration among high earners whose wealth has been “inflated by the stock market” is a major concern for Edwards, who pointed out that if there is a major stock market correction, then U.S. consumption will be “hit very, very badly indeed,” and the entire economy will suffer. This view is increasingly shared by less über-bearish voices on Wall Street, such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett. In many ways, Edwards told Fortune, we’re overdue for a correction, noting that apart from two months during the pandemic, there hasn’t been a recession since 2008. “That’s a bloody long time, and the business cycle eventually always goes into recession.” He said it’s been so long that his perma-bear instincts are confused. “The fact I’m less worried about an imminent collapse [right now] makes me worried,” Edwards added with a laugh. Edwards told Fortune that he’s been through various cycles and bubbles and he gained his perma-bear status in the mid-1990s, when he felt a distant earthquake happening in Asia. “You’ve been around the block a few times, you just do become cynical,” he said, before correcting himself: “That’s not the right word. You become extremely skeptical of the full narrative.” He proudly repeats the story about how, when he was at Dresdner Kleinwort in the ’90s, he wrote with skepticism about Malaysia’s economic boom at the time, only to be surprised when Thailand blew up first. Nevertheless, he said, “we lost all our banking licenses [in Malaysia] because of what I wrote,” adding that the story is still proudly pinned to his X.com account. “I had to sort of basically hide under my desk,” Edwards said of the inward reception to the emergence of his inner bear. “Corporate finance banking departments certainly didn’t appreciate losing all their banking licenses. But in retrospect, you know, they avoided a final year of lending to Malaysia before it blew up. They didn’t thank me afterwards.” Beyond equity valuations, Edwards has been highlighting two other major underlying risks that point to systemic vulnerability. First, Edwards emphasized the long-term risk of inflation in the West, driven by “fiscal incontinence.” Despite short-term cyclical deflationary pressure emanating from China—which has seen 12 successive quarters of year-on-year declines in its GDP deflator—Edwards said he believes the path of least resistance for highly indebted Western politicians will be “money printing.” At some point, the mathematics for fiscal sustainability “just do not add up,” forcing central banks to intervene through “yield curve control” or quantitative easing to hold down bond yields. This is where Edwards’ long-held thesis about Japan comes in, what he calls “the Ice Age.” Around 1996, he said, he started thinking that “what’s happening in Japan will come to Europe and the U.S. with a lag.” He explained that the bursting of the Japanese stock bubble led to all kinds of nasty things: real interest rates collapsing, inflation going to zero, bond yields going to zero. Ultimately, it was a period of low growth that Japan still has not been able to break out of. The difference with the U.S., he added, is that Japanification actually started happening in 2000 with the dotcom bubble bursting, but “the relationship broke” between the economy and asset prices as the Fed began “throwing money” at the problem through QE. The U.S. has essentially been in a 25-year bubble since then that is due to burst any day now, he argued—it’s been due any day for a quarter-century. “We’re going to end up with runaway inflation at some point,” Edwards told Fortune, “because, I mean, that’s the end game, right? There’s no appetite to cut back the deficits. We bring back the QE, if and when this bubble bursts, the only solution is more QE, and then we end up with inflation, maybe even worse than 2022.” Edwards also sees a smoking gun in home prices. “You look at the U.S. housing market, you think, ‘Well, actually, is the Fed just too loose relative to everywhere else?’ Because why should other housing bubbles have deflated in terms of house price earnings ratio, but the U.S. is still stuck up there at maximum valuation or close to it?” In a flourish that shows why Edwards is so respected despite his broken-record reputation, he notes that in a Bloomberg Opinion piece from 2018, legendary former Fed Chair Paul Volcker “eviscerated the Fed just before he died.” The central banker who famously slew inflation in the 1980s argued that the modern era’s loose monetary policy was “a grave error of judgment…basically just kicking the can down the road.” Edwards shared an OECD chart with Fortune to show just how much U.S. housing has decoupled from global markets because the Fed has been too loose. The analyst also said he applied his skepticism to private equity, an asset class that he sees having benefited immensely from years of falling bond yields and leverage. Private equity’s advantage has been its tax treatment and the fact that “it doesn’t have to mark itself to market, so it isn’t very volatile.” However, the sector is highly leveraged, and if the global environment shifts to a secular bear market for bonds, he said that would be a “major problem.” Recent high-profile bankruptcies have started to leak into bond markets, prompting concern of “credit cockroaches,” as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently labeled the issue. Drawing on the metaphor that “you never have just one cockroach,” Edwards warned that these bankruptcies signal deeper issues in a highly leveraged sector that has spread its “tentacles…deeply into the real economy.” Fortune notes to Edwards that more mainstream, less bearish voices are sounding similar warnings, including Mohamed El-Erian at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference and Jeffrey Gundlach, the “bond king,” who takes a similarly skeptical view of private equity. Edwards agreed that something is in the air. “I would say there are more voices of skepticism. And again, this is one thing which makes me worry. This bubble can go on. If it is a bubble [it] can go on quite a long while. Well, we can kick the can down the road many times. Normally, the skeptics are swept aside.” For investors trapped between the fear of a collapse and the fear of missing a melt-up, Edwards advised investors to take him with a grain of salt but be mindful of potential warning signs. “I say that I predict a recession every year. Don’t listen to me, but these are the things you should be looking out for.” Paraphrasing an infamous quote from former Citi CEO Chuck Prince that summed up the bubble mentality with a metaphor about a dance party, Edwards recommended: “In terms of dancing while the music’s still playing, you have to decide whether to be in front of the band, pogoing, or dancing close to the fire escape, ready to get out first.”

Currently, the development of digital finance in China’s rural areas remains in its early stages. The proportion of rural households participating in digital finance and the types of participation are relatively low. This hinders the realization of digital finance’s inclusive effects. This paper examines the influence of migrant work experience on participation in digital financial of rural households using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The findings suggest that migrant work experience significantly increases the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and increases the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation more for rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Along with the rapid development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet and big data, finance has combined with them to form a new financial business model. Compared to traditional finance, digital finance significantly lowers the barriers to financial services and transaction costs while expanding the reach of financial products [1]. Digital finance provides financial services to underserved populations globally to promote their consumption [2], entrepreneurship [3,4], household welfare [5], and regional economic development [6]. Especially for rural areas beyond the reach of traditional finance, digital finance breaks the geographical limitation of financial services, alleviates financial exclusion and poverty in remote rural areas, and becomes an important way to promote the development of inclusive finance [7,8]. Family digital finance participation refers to the use of digital financial tools such as digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital lending by households. Despite the many benefits of digital finance, the participation rate of Chinese rural households in digital finance is generally low [9]. 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data show that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance was only 20.96% [10]. 2019 Rural survey data from four Chinese provinces show that less than 20% of rural households use more than two digital financial products [11]. 2021 Data from the China Rural Economy and Rural Finance Survey (CRERFS) similarly show that the average number of rural households using three types of digital finance is only 1.025 [12]. In fact, the use of digital finance puts forward higher requirements for farmers’ digital skills and financial knowledge, which makes rural residents with backward economy and low average education level more likely to be excluded [13]. The ability of rural households to participate in digital finance is key to enabling rural households to enjoy the dividends of digital experience development, and improving the well-being of rural residents. Therefore, research on the factors influencing rural households’ digital financial participation has recently attracted increasing attention from scholars and policymakers in developing countries. Existing literature has primarily examined rural households’ participation in digital finance from perspectives including personal financial literacy [14], ICT usage [9], e-commerce adoption [15], regional digital financial development [16], regional network infrastructure [17], and regional pandemic situations [18]. Economists have accumulated a large body of evidence that an individual’s early experiences can have a significant impact on later behavioral decisions. Studies by sociologists and psychologists have found that an individual’s early experiences can have an impact on later decision-making and behavioral competencies [19,20]. First, early experiences have a profound effect on an individual’s later decisions. For example, a manager’s experience can have an impact on his or her later managerial decisions in the firm. CEOs’ international work experience leads to higher compensation [21]. Firms whose CEOs experienced the Chinese famine early in their careers experienced lower stock price declines than firms that did not [22]. Second, early experiences can influence an individual’s ability to behave later in life. For example, work experience can promote pro-social behavior in adolescents [23]. Early grassroots work experience for tax officials enhances their ability to serve as Chinese officials later in life [24]. As one of the significant life experiences for farmers, migration work experience inevitably exerts a considerable influence on their decision-making. However, no literature has yet explored this phenomenon. This paper makes the following key contributions. First, it explores the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ participation in digital finance, thereby enriching the research perspective. Second, it reveals the underlying mechanisms through which migrant work experience influences rural households’ digital finance participation, deepening our understanding of the intrinsic link between migrant work experience and digital finance engagement. Finally, it examines the heterogeneous effects of migrant workers’ work experience on rural households’ digital finance behaviors, providing insights for developing differentiated policies to enhance rural digital finance participation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of migrants’ work experience on the financial vulnerability of rural households and formulates the research hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data, models, and variables used in the empirical study. Section 4 reports the baseline results, robustness tests, and heterogeneity analysis results of the empirical study. Section 5 presents the results of mechanism analysis. Section 6 presents the conclusions and corresponding policy recommendations. Under the influence of urban human capital externalities, migrant workers subconsciously mimic and learn from high-skilled individuals, achieving complementary advantages in skills and resources. This enhances their income, cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and accumulates human capital, ultimately making their labor experience a key event in their lives. This migrant work experience forms a special kind of memory imprint that retains previous psycho-cognitive patterns and behavioral habits even after the labor force returns home, and has a profound impact on the family’s economic behavioral decisions. It has been shown that migrant work experience positively contributes to farmers’ economic capital, human capital, social capital, and visionary attitudes [25,26], thereby contributing to rural households’ participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance. Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by increasing their level of financial literacy. Financial literacy, as a vital form of human capital, effectively promotes household participation in digital finance by enhancing families’ understanding of financial products and decision-making capabilities [27,28]. After migrating to economically developed cities for work, farmers gain significantly increased access to financial institutions and products such as banks, securities, credit cards, and funds. This exposure continuously broadens their financial horizons and market awareness, ultimately fostering the accumulation of financial knowledge [29]. Moreover, migrant work contributes to increased household income. As earnings rise, farmers develop greater needs for wealth management and asset appreciation, thereby motivating them to proactively acquire financial knowledge [30]. This, in turn, enhances their ability to manage household finances and preserve or grow their assets. The experience of migrant work can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by broadening their social networks. Social networks, as an important informal system, can establish a demonstration effect of rural households’ participation in digital finance [31]. Within social networks, when acquaintances utilize digital financial products and derive benefits from them, they share various information during daily interactions. This not only helps other households broaden their access to information, enabling them to better understand digital finance, but also builds trust in digital financial platforms by disseminating experiences. This reduces feelings of unfamiliarity and apprehension, thereby stimulating willingness to participate in digital finance. Furthermore, social networks foster mutual assistance among members. When encountering difficulties or risks during digital financial activities, individuals can seek advice and support from friends, relatives, and others within their relational networks [32]. This reduces their perceived risks associated with digital finance participation and strengthens their confidence to engage. Migrant work not only allows rural families to maintain their original kinship and geographic networks, but also expands new social networks such as karma and friendships in the new work [33]. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in the digital finance by increasing their financial literacy and expanding their social networks. The data used in this study come from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), which is conducted by the China Household Finance Survey and Research Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics on a sample basis every two years, and comprehensively tracks households’ dynamic financial behaviors, providing the researcher with detailed information on household credit, financial assets, and insurance. The data used in this study are from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The CHFS data sample covers 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), 345 counties, and 1,359 communities (villages) nationwide, with a stratified sample of 34,643 households, ensuring strong representativeness. In addition to the demographic characteristics, economic features, and financial literacy information, the 2019 CHFS data also includes household migration and migrant work experiences, as well as participation in digital finance. According to the purpose of the study, the sample of heads of households under 18 years old and those who go out to school are excluded, and the sample data of 9096 rural households are retained after removing the missing values. The per capita GDP data at the regional level comes from the China Statistical Yearbook. This article examines the impact of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation among rural households. Since the explanatory variable whether rural households participate in digital finance is a binary discrete variable, a probit model is constructed. The model is set up as follows: Where is the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation, denotes whether householder has migrant work experience. is a vector of control variables, and is the error term. Since the explanatory variable breadth of household digital finance is a discrete variable with counting characteristics, this paper constructs a Poisson model to analyze the impact of migrant workers’ work experience on the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. The hypothesis probability is determined by the Poisson distribution of parameters, and the model is set up as follows: Where is the number of households using digital financial instruments, is Poisson’s arrival rate, and represents the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. Furthermore, based on the preceding analysis, farmers’ financial literacy and social networks mediate the impact of migrant work experience on their participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article constructs a mediation model to test this. The traditional mediation model does not consider the endogeneity of the mediating variables, and when the mediating variables have endogeneity problems, resulting in the estimation results may be biased. The mediating variables in this article are financial literacy and social networks of farm households, both of which have endogeneity problems such as omitted variables or reverse causality that may exist between them and digital financial participation of rural households. When the intervening variable and the mediating variable are endogenous at the same time, the instrumental variables of the intervening variable and the instrumental variables of the mediating variable need to be utilized to identify the mediating effects. This article builds on the following model [34] by adding instrumental variables for the mediating variables to complete the causal identification of mediating effects: In model (3) are channel variables, including financial literacy and social network. denotes the effect of migrant working experience on each channel variable, is the error term; is the only endogenous variable in the model. In model (4), denotes the direct effect of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation; denotes the effect of channel variables on rural households’ digital financial participation after controlling for the migrant work variable, is the error term; The model includes two endogenous variables, and channel variables. This paper has two explanatory variables: probability of participation in digital finance (Probability of participation in digital finance) and breadth of participation in digital finance (Breadth of Participation in Digital Finance). Based on the definition of digital finance by existing scholars, it mainly refers to traditional financial institutions providing payment, financing, investment and other new types of financial services with the help of digital technology [1]. Therefore, this paper focuses on measuring rural households’ digital finance participation by examining the use of the most frequently used financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance. The questions on digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance management in the questionnaire used are (1) Digital payment: have households used payment methods such as online banking, mobile banking, Alipay, and WeChat? (2) Digital lending: have households used internet borrowing, credit loans or crowdfunding? (3) Digital finance: Have they purchased financial products? The variable of whether to participate in digital finance and the variable of the breadth of participation in digital finance are measured as follows: if a rural household has used any one of the financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, digital finance, etc., it is considered to have participated in digital finance, which takes the value of 1, and vice versa 0. The breadth of participation in digital finance is measured by the number of types of digital financial instruments mentioned above that have been used by the rural household. The core explanatory variable in this article is the migratory work experience of the farm household, which takes the value of 1 if the head of the household has lived or worked for more than half a year outside of the province/city where he/she resides, and 0 otherwise. In addition, since this article focuses on work experience, the sample of those who have migrated due to their schooling has been excluded. The mediating variables for this article are financial literacy and social networks. In the measure of financial literacy, considering the differences in the level of financial literacy represented by farmers answering “I don’t know” and answering incorrectly when confronted with a financial literacy question [35], the number of direct answers to financial questions and the number of correct answers to financial questions were used respectively to measure farmers’ financial literacy level. The three main financial literacy questions in the questionnaire include interest question, inflation question, and compound interest question. The questionnaire used contained questions related to financial literacy in three areas: interest, inflation, and compound interest. Interest problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 4% per year, if you deposit 100 yuan for 1 year, the principal and interest you will receive after 1 year will be?; Inflation problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 5% per year and the inflation rate is 8% per year, what will you be able to buy after one year of saving 100 yuan in the bank?; Compound Interest Problem: If you take out a loan or deposit 10,000 yuan and compound interest at 10% per year, what is the total amount of principal and interest you will need to repay after two years?. For each of the above questions, two dummy variables can be generated for whether or not to answer “don’t know” and whether or not to answer incorrectly, and a total of six dummy variables can be obtained for the three questions, and the factor analysis method is used to get the score of financial literacy of the farmers. In the measure of social network, Rural China is a highly humanized and relational society, and social relationships among people often follow the agreed-upon principle of “exchange of gifts”. Family gift income and expenditure is an important means of maintaining family social network relationships, and can reflect the strength of family social network relationships. Therefore, this article uses the logarithm of the total amount of household gift income and expenditure to measure the level of social networks. In this study, three variables may exhibit endogeneity: migrant work experience, financial literacy, and social networks. This stems from potential omitted variables related to migrant work experience. Simultaneously, household digital financial participation may also exert a reverse effect on financial literacy and social networks. Households with broader participation are more likely to access financial information online and form new social connections, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy and social networks. Therefore, to effectively mitigate estimation biases arising from reverse causality and omitted variables, this study requires establishing corresponding instrumental variables for each endogenous variable, while simultaneously satisfying the requirements of instrument relevance and exclusivity. First, drawing upon existing literature [36,37], this study selects the migration work atmosphere within the village (community) (IV_mw) as an instrumental variable for rural households’ migration work experience. This is measured by the proportion of households within the village (community) that have migration work experience, excluding the interviewed household. In terms of relevance, given the informational network characteristics of rural household migration work [38], households within the same village (community) share work information and experiences, assisting others in migration efforts. When a village has more migrants, the likelihood of the surveyed household engaging in migration work increases. Regarding exclusivity, the migration work environment within villages does not directly influence household participation in digital finance. This is because the migration work environment itself can only provide information or social pressure. Only when households actually engage in migration work will key factors such as income growth, improved financial literacy, and changes in financial needs be directly triggered, thereby driving the use of digital finance. Without actual migration experience, other channels like idea dissemination or peer modeling often yield limited results due to the absence of economic incentives and foundational capabilities. Second, this study selects the interaction term between regional traditional financial development levels and household attention to financial information (IV_fl) as an instrumental variable for financial literacy. It measures traditional financial development levels using the logarithm of regional financial institutions’ loan balances in 2014. The choice of 2014 stems from the fact that China’s digital inclusive finance began rapid development only after the State Council issued the “Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance” in 2015. In terms of correlation, regions with more developed traditional financial sectors provide residents with greater opportunities for both passive exposure and active learning of financial knowledge. Rural households with high attention to financial information are more likely to proactively seek out financial news, market trends, wealth management knowledge, and information from their surroundings, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy. Regarding exclusivity, prior to the rise of digital inclusive finance in China, the level of traditional financial development could only influence households’ digital financial participation decisions by affecting their financial literacy. Finally, this study selected the interaction term between the proportion of the region’s most common surname and household financial support provided to non-household members (IV_sn) as an instrumental variable for social networks. In terms of relevance, surnames serve as a key indicator for distinguishing whether rural households belong to the same clan [39]. A higher number of prevalent surnames in a region indicates broader social networks among rural households. Simultaneously, household financial support to non-household members reflects rural households’ capacity for external social interaction, closely linked to expenditures on household social networks. Regarding exclusivity, the proportion of surnames in a village carries distinct clan and cultural characteristics, unaffected by individual household traits. It is unlikely to be influenced by variables other than household social networks, thereby satisfying the exogeneity requirement for the instrumental variable. This paper selects a series of control variables at the level of personal characteristics of farm households, household characteristics and regional characteristics, respectively. Individual characteristics include sex (Gender), age (Age), years of education (Education), marital status (Marriage), and health (Health) of the household head. Household characteristics variables include owner-occupied housing (House), household size (Size), household Elderly dependency ratio (Elder), household Child dependency ratio (Child), total household income (Income), total household assets (Assets), and business engaged in by the household (Commerce). Regional characteristics variables include the logarithm of GDP per capita (Pergdp) and regional dummy variables. Table 1 shows the definitions of the variables. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t001 Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics and mean differences of the main variables. The result of the mean value of rural households’ digital finance participation shows that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance is 32% and the average breadth of participation in digital finance is 0.368. This indicates that the probability and breadth of digital financial participation are not high. The mean test also revealed that households with migrant work experience exhibit a higher probability and greater breadth of participation in digital finance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t002 Table 3 reports the results of the baseline regressions on the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) find that the coefficients on the impact of migrant work experience on the probability and breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation are positively significant at the 1% statistical level without the inclusion of control variables. The results in columns (2) and (4) find that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability of participation and breadth of participation in digital finance for rural households is also positively significant when all control variables are added. The above results indicate that migrant work experience contributes significantly to both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t003 Among the control variables, the age, education level, and health status of the household head significantly influence rural households’ participation in digital finance. At the household level, household size, business investment, and total assets positively affect households’ digital finance behavior. At the regional level, per capita GDP positively influences households’ digital finance behavior. The household head’s gender, marital status, owner-occupied housing, and total income do not significantly affect households’ digital finance behavior. Although there is no reverse causality between past migrant labor experiences of rural households and current digital financial participation of rural households, the results may still be biased by omitted variables. Table 4 reports the results of the estimation using instrumental variables. Column (1) presents the estimation results using the IV-Probit model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of out-of-home labor experience on the probability of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. Column (2) presents the estimation results using IV-Poisson model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of migrant labor experience on the breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. The F-value of 325.37 in the first stage indicates that the selected instrumental variable is not a weak instrumental variable. The results of the endogeneity test show that after considering endogeneity, the migrant work experience still has a positive impact on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and the breadth of participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t004 Since the migrant work decision-making is not random, but affected by many factors such as individual farmers and households, it may lead to endogenous problems caused by sample self-selection, resulting in biased results. To solve this problem, this paper use the propensity score matching method (PSM) to mitigate this bias. The propensity score method (PSM) could create a near-randomized experiment by identifying the sample that is closest to the treatment and control groups in terms of covariates, in order to reduce estimation bias. In this study, according to whether the farmers have migrant work experience, the sample was divided into families with migrant work experience (treatment group) and families with no migrant work experience (control group).By using the logit model to calculate the propensity score with Participate in digital finance and Breadth of participation as the dependent variables, four common matching methods, namely nearest neighbor matching (K = 3), radius matching, kernel matching and local linear regression matching, were selected to re-estimate the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results of the balance test (S1 Table) show that none of the P-values were significant after matching, indicating that there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Table 5 reports the results of the average treatment effect (ATT) of migrant work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households estimated using the PSM. The estimation results of the four matching methods are less different, but all are positively significant at the 1% level. The average treatment effect of outwork experience on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.085 and 0.102, and the average treatment effect of outwork experience on the breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.101 and 0.122. The PSM estimation results are relatively close to the baseline regression results, which further validates the robustness of the main findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t005 While the instrumental variable method was used in the previous section to mitigate potential omitted variable problems, it was considered that the use of cross-sectional data also introduces omitted variable bias that may lead to endogeneity problems. To further overcome potential endogeneity problems, this paper will construct balanced panel data for estimation using Chinese household finance data (CHFS) for 2017 and 2019, and the descriptive statistics of the data are shown in S2 Table, and the regression results are shown in Table 6. This paper controls for the same control variables as the baseline regression, except for fixing time and region. The results report that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positive and significant, indicating that migrant work experience has a significant contribution to digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t006 The exclusivity condition for the instrumental variable of village migration work atmosphere may not be satisfied. While migration work atmosphere can influence digital financial participation through the migration decisions of surveyed households, this may not be the sole pathway. For instance, under peer group effects, the migration work atmosphere within the village exerts the same influence on migration decisions of households other than the surveyed one, with migration experience directly impacting their digital financial participation. In other words, the instrumental variable may indirectly influence the respondent household’s digital financial participation by affecting other households’ engagement. Concurrently, an infrastructure effect may exist: villages with stronger migration work atmospheres may attract more financial institutions and digital infrastructure, thereby enhancing household digital financial participation. Given these considerations, this study incorporates village digital financial participation, rural financial institutions, and rural digital infrastructure as control variables in the model to block these pathways and enhance the exclusivity of the village migration work atmosphere as an instrumental variable. Table 7 shows that after adding these controls, the impact of migration work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation remains robust. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t007 To examine the heterogeneity of the impact of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation across groups, this paper regresses the sample into groups with respect to the types of work performed during migrant work, long-tail groups, and regional differences, respectively. The type of work during migrant work has an important impact on the ability of migrant workers to effectively accumulate experience, knowledge, and contacts. It is generally recognized that people with formal work or entrepreneurial experience typically not only have higher income levels, but are also more likely to have access to a wealth of information and asset management skills [40], factors that contribute to their better participation in digital financial markets. Table 8 reports the impact of migrants’ formal work experience and migrants’ entrepreneurial experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant formal work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households are both significantly positive, suggesting that migrant formal work experience has a greater facilitating effect. The reason is that engaging in formal work usually has a more stable wage income and a clearer compensation system, which makes migrant farm households more confident in investing and borrowing on digital finance platforms and enhances their motivation to participate in digital finance. The results in columns (2) and (4) show that the effect of migrant entrepreneurship experience on the probability of rural households’ digital finance participation is insignificant and the effect on the breadth of digital finance participation is positively significant. The possible explanation is that entrepreneurship itself is characterized by high risk and uncertainty, and many rural households may be wary of digital financial participation because they fear that the use of digital financial products during migrant entrepreneurship may increase financial risk. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t008 The impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation is also likely to vary across farm households’ education levels. This paper examines the sample by dividing it into two groups, those who have not completed compulsory education and those who have completed compulsory education, based on the required number of years of compulsory education in China (9 years).The results in Table 9 show that the marginal contribution of migrant work experience to the probability and breadth of household digital finance participation is greater for farmers who have completed years of compulsory education compared to those who have not completed years of compulsory education. This is because farmers who have completed compulsory education are usually more adaptable and able to acquire digital skills and learn financial literacy more quickly, enabling them to be more willing to engage in digital financial activities and continue to expand the breadth of their participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t009 In addition, the paper also seeks to understand whether migrant work experiences can facilitate the participation of disadvantaged rural households in digital finance. According to the Long Tail Theory, traditional financial models tend to focus resources on “head” customers at the expense of “tail” customers, and disadvantaged farmers who are excluded from traditional finance are also more likely to be excluded from digital finance. Drawing on existing literature [11], rural households with per capita household incomes below the 2018 Chinese National Poverty Standard Line of 3,200 yuan are defined as the long-tail group. The results in Table 10 show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant work experience on the probability of household digital financial participation and the breadth of participation are larger for the long-tail group than for the non-long-tail group. This suggests that migrant work experience brings more significant marginal improvement effects of cognitive ability enhancement and social network expansion for the long-tail group, which in turn strongly promotes their participation in digital financial activities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t010 How does the migrant work experience contribute to rural households’ participation in digital finance? This section will delve further into the channels and mechanisms through which such experiences may have an impact. Table 11 reports the results of testing the financial literacy mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on financial literacy. The coefficient for the financial literacy variable is significantly positive at the 1% significance level, indicating that migrant work experience positively enhances farmers’ financial literacy. The F-value in the first stage is 317.80, far exceeding the empirical value of 10, confirming that the instrumental variables are not weak. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results for the joint effects of migrant work experience and financial literacy on rural households’ probability and breadth of digital financial participation. Both migrant work experience and financial literacy exhibit positive and significant coefficients. The Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic of 87.228 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming no weak instrumentation issues. Furthermore, considering potential violations of the sequential neglectability assumption, this study adopts the research approach from Ima [41,42] to conduct sensitivity tests on the financial literacy mechanism (S3 Fig). The results confirm that the causal inference of the financial literacy mediation effect is valid and robust. These findings collectively demonstrate that migration work experience promotes rural households’ participation in digital finance by enhancing their financial literacy levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t011 Table 12 reports the results of testing the social network mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on social networks. The coefficient for the migrant work experience variable is significantly positive at the 1% statistical level, indicating that migrant work experience significantly expands rural households’ social networks. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results examining the joint effects of migrant work experience and social networks on the probability and breadth of household digital financial participation. Both variables exhibit statistically significant positive coefficients at the 1% level. The Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic of 267.015 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming the absence of weak instrumental variable issues. Sensitivity analysis (S3 Fig) on the social network mechanism confirms the validity and robustness of the causal inference regarding the mediating effect of social networks. These findings demonstrate that migrant work experience promotes rural household participation in digital finance by expanding their social networks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t012 Insufficient digital financial participation of rural households largely hinders the development of rural inclusive finance and farmers’ access to the dividends of digital economic development. Starting from the new perspective of migrant work experience, this study examines the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation based on the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data. The study found that migrant work experience is an important influence on rural households’ digital financial participation, significantly contributing to the probability of digital financial participation and increasing the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation of rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups more. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks. Based on the above research findings, this article puts forward the following policy recommendations. First, while encouraging farmers to seek employment outside their hometowns, the government should focus on optimizing the employment environment and providing robust support to farming households. For instance, this could involve expanding formal employment channels through vocational skills training, or supporting independent entrepreneurship through business guarantees and subsidies. In addition, For migrant working farmers with a low level of education, training in the basics of digital finance is provided on a case-by-case basis, and personalized digital finance guidance services are provided to enhance their willingness to participate in digital finance. Financial institutions should develop low-threshold, flexible and diverse digital financial products to meet the financial needs of low-income migrant working farmers in different scenarios, based on their actual needs. At the same time, the leading role of farmers with high levels of education should be utilized, and these farmers should be encouraged to serve as volunteers or tutors for digital financial education, so as to teach digital financial skills to other farmers and enhance the willingness of farmers with low levels of education to participate in digital finance. Secondly, the Government should further strengthen education and training in rural financial knowledge and expand the social network of migrant working farmers. The government can collaborate with financial institutions to establish dedicated online communication platforms for migrant workers or regularly organize offline forums, providing spaces for them to exchange work and life experiences as well as financial knowledge. This approach enables them not only to share insights on using digital finance face-to-face but also to foster mutual trust and connections, expand their social networks, and ultimately boost the entire group’s enthusiasm for adopting digital financial services. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s003 (DOCX)

Title: Tesla's robotaxi clears a key hurdle in Nevada
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robotaxi-dmv-approval-nevada-autonomous-cars-self-certification-2025-11
Time Published: 2025-11-21T05:11:39Z

Tesla just got one step closer to deploying its robotaxis commercially in Nevada. Tesla completed the self-certification process for the robotaxi in Nevada, a DMV representative told Business Insider. This step means the company can deploy an autonomous car on Nevada roads, but it still needs approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate commercially. A spokesperson for the NTA told Business Insider that Tesla has yet to submit an application for the permit. Clearing self-certification in Nevada comes as CEO Elon Musk aims to expand ride-hailing in up to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year, with a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles. "We expect to be operating in Nevada and Florida and Arizona by the end of the year," Musk said on an October earnings call. Tesla's robotaxis are operating commercially in San Francisco and Austin. The company is hiring in cities such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, and Orlando, as it ramps up the robotaxi deployment process. On Monday, Tesla received approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate ride-hailing services in the state. It also submitted a "self-certification" to test its robotaxis in the state with safety drivers, a spokesperson for the department told Business Insider. Meanwhile, in California, a robotaxi war is breaking out. Uber, Tesla, and Waymo are fighting to shape robotaxi regulations in the state. Waymo, which operates self-driving taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, said in November that companies offering autonomous ride-hailing services should submit quarterly reports about the rides. Tesla opposed this suggestion. This week, Amazon launched its Zoox robotaxi service in San Francisco, offering select members of the public free rides. Tesla's stock price dropped about 2% on Thursday. It's up more than 15% in the past year. Update: November 21, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the NTA. Jump to

November 20, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the half year ended 30 September 2025 Resilient half year performance with good progress on delivery of key growth projects GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: “We have continued to build on an encouraging start to the year and in the first half we have reached important milestones in the delivery of major projects key to our long-term growth plans. Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges, we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so. As the current year has progressed, we have faced two challenges: firstly, the impact from the disruption to our parcels network from the harmonisation of InPost and Yodel services combined with the commercial terms of our new 3-year contract has been greater than we had anticipated, and secondly, while obconnect continues to build its new business pipeline and range of opportunities, the pace of growth and monetising of these opportunities in year is slower than we had planned. In the first half, the underlying business performance has continued to trade in line with expectations and, throughout the Group, we have continued to broaden the adoption of our enhanced capabilities into our existing client base, develop and execute on strong new business pipelines and accelerate the execution of our key strategic projects. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service in August 2025 for the Lloyds Banking Group, enabling consumer cash deposits via their banking app across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. In September 2025, we extended the service to enable deposits via card for their customers in 3,000 sites, and we are now working to enable further High St Banks for the service over the next 12 months. In Parcels, we announced the strategic investment by Royal Mail into the Collect+ business in September 2025, with over 3,000 sites now branded as Royal Mail Shop enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collect, send and return parcels. In both these projects the key to the ramp up of significant transaction volumes is a strong follow-on communications and marketing campaign to support consumer awareness and adoption of these services through our network. In Open Banking and Digital payments, we have secured further wins as we grow our strong market position in the Housing sector particularly, including Peabody Housing for the full suite of MultiPay payment solutions and the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments for Confirmation of Payee. In addition, we are delivering several open banking initiatives into our utilities client base while working closely with obconnect in identifying new sector opportunities for open banking. In Love2shop, our partnership with InComm Payments has continued to accelerate, with further expansion into major retailers and a material step up in billings ahead of peak. Consumer uncertainty and tightening household budgets are not new factors as we enter the peak trading period for several of our businesses. For the second half of the year, our focus remains on 1) tight cost discipline and driving efficiencies as we continue to work with Nile Partners to establish the right organisational framework for the future, 2) strong execution of the projects supporting our long-term growth plans, and 3) good operating disciplines across the business as a whole and agility to respond to the two specific business challenges and the broader changing market conditions. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our long-term objectives has provided the platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year” DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 0.6% to £33.1 million (H1 FY25: £32.9 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased by 7.5% to £8.6 million (H1 FY25: £8.0 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 4.4% to £26.0 million (H1 FY25: £24.9 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue decreased by 9.6% to £17.0 million (H1 FY25: £18.8 million) MANAGING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CHALLENGES As the current year has progressed, we have faced two specific business challenges: 1. Impact of renewed 3-year commercial contract and InPost/Yodel network harmonisation Following the acquisition of Yodel by InPost, a new 3-year commercial contract was negotiated and agreed for the combined business. This contract recognised the continued importance of the long-term partnership between InPost and PayPoint, including a commitment to a minimum level of volume through the Collect+ network and an expansion of the number of sites offered to InPost customers to reflect the existing Yodel network, albeit on less favourable commercial terms to PayPoint. Our expectation has been that the enlarged Collect+ network for InPost / Yodel customers would result in increased volumes to mitigate these less favourable commercial terms. In the second quarter this has not been the case, with the initiatives from InPost to harmonise the enlarged InPost/Yodel business resulting in significant disruption to service and parcel volumes across the Collect + network. We believe the immediate impact of this operational disruption has now reduced, largely managed through proactive actions from the two businesses and we expect to see volumes through the Collect + network recover as we move into the traditional peak trading period. 2. New business pipeline growth in obconnectIn obconnect, the first half has seen a consolidation in the business and reassessment of the new business opportunities following PayPoint taking a majority ownership of the business. For PayPoint, obconnect delivers the platform to drive growth for both new and existing clients through the provision of Open Banking services and payments channels. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as well as broader Open Banking solutions. We have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with Verification of Payee (VoP) in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY26 and into next year. Our confidence in the opportunities obconnect brings from its range of capabilities and technology is undiminished. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. The market for Account-to-Account (A2A) payments and account information across Europe, UK and USA remains strong and obconnect is well positioned to help organisations achieve connectivity to these ecosystems. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was also agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for PayPoint and obconnect. Following a maiden contribution in the first half, we expect obconnect to deliver a stronger performance in the second half and an improvement in net revenue achieved for H2 FY25. DELIVERY OF KEY GROWTH PROJECTS The standout achievement of the first half has been the successful launch of multiple projects that enhance our consumer proposition in several areas of our business, establish important partnerships and strengthen the long-term prospects of the business. Each of these projects has required detailed planning and collaboration with our partners and a business wide effort to deliver. In each case the focus is now shifting from rollout to the necessary marketing and consumer awareness campaigns to drive awareness and adoption. 1. Launch of PayPoint BankLocal with the Lloyds Banking Group On 26 August 2025, we launched our BankLocal service enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. This successful launch was supported by a business-wide effort to prepare and train our retailer partners to deliver this vital new service, with over 240,000 direct communications delivered, over 4,000 store visits completed and a Trustpilot score of 4.9/5 achieved from retailer feedback. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed7 since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service further with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. 2. Launch of Royal Mail Shop and strategic investment in Collect+ by Royal Mail As announced on 30 September 2025, International Distribution Services (IDS), owner of Royal Mail, completed a strategic investment in Collect+ to take a 49% ownership, with an investment of £43.9 million, valuing the Collect+ business at £90 million. The Collect+ business has seen strong growth over the past 5 years as we have established it as the leading open Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK. Currently, Collect+ has a network of over 14,000 OOH locations in the UK, of which almost 8,000 offer Royal Mail collect, send and return parcel services today. As part of the next stage in this partnership, over 3,000 of these sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store. The balance of the 8,000 sites will have Royal Mail Shop branding rolled out over the course of the next 6 months. Over the next 12 months the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks by Q4 FY26. 7 As of close of business 16 November 2025 Establishing this partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK. As an open network, Collect+ will continue to work closely with the carrier partners with whom it has well-established relationships to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK and to invest in the technology and training required to deliver an outstanding consumer experience. 3. Acceleration of Love2shop partnership with InComm PaymentsFollowing the launch of our partnership with InComm Payments in October 2024, we have established a strong new sales channel enabling distribution of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St brands. The partnership has delivered a strong half year performance, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5%. We have also delivered further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, with sales in this channel +54% year on year, leveraging the strength of the Love2shop brand and reinforcing our expanded multichannel strategy for Love2shop gift card sales across digital and physical channels Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026. RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NUMBERS BUSINESS DIVISION NET REVENUE AND MIX EnquiriesPayPoint plc FGS Global Nick Wiles, Chief Executive (Mobile: 07442 968960) Rollo HeadRob Harding, Chief Financial Officer (Mobile: 07525 707970 James Thompson (Tel: 0207 251 3801) A presentation for analysts is being held at 9.30am today (20 November 2025) via webcast. This announcement, along with details for the webcast, is available on the PayPoint Plc website: paypointbusiness.com/corporate 8 Exceptional items comprise £2.6 million for legal costs related to claims against PayPoint and £0.6 million for organisational framework costs CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW GROUP UPDATE Resilient half year performance with good progress on delivery of key growth projects We have continued to build on an encouraging start to the year and in the first half we have reached important milestones in the delivery of major projects key to our long-term growth plans. Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so. As the current year has progressed, we have faced two challenges: firstly, the impact from the disruption to our parcels network from the harmonisation of InPost and Yodel services combined with the commercial terms of our new 3-year contract has been greater than we had anticipated, and secondly, while obconnect continues to build its new business pipeline and range of opportunities, the pace of growth and monetising of these opportunities in year is slower than we had planned. Consumer uncertainty and tightening household budgets are not new factors as we enter the peak trading period for several of our businesses. For the second half of the year our focus remains on 1) tight cost discipline and driving efficiencies as we continue to work with Nile Partners to establish the right organisational framework for the future, 2) strong execution of the projects supporting our long-term growth plans, and 3) good operating disciplines across the business as a whole and agility to respond to the two specific business challenges and the broader changing market conditions. Our longer-term growth targets to the end of FY28 As announced at our full year results in June 2025, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group Our strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum in the medium term. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x The actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, it has been an intensive period where we have focused our efforts on supporting our retailer partners to deliver more revenue from PayPoint services and a business-wide effort to prepare and train sites ahead of the major launches of BankLocal and Royal Mail Shops. Our new Store Growth Specialist team, launched at the beginning of the financial year, has continued to have a positive impact with retailers, driven by targeted data and support. The learnings from the success of this team are now being assessed, with a view to scaling best practice across our entire field team. Key focus areas in the half year have been merchandising new Love2shop physical gift card units in over 2,000 sites ahead of the key peak trading period and completing an extensive training and merchandising programme for our BankLocal and Royal Mail Shop rollouts. Over 4,000 site visits have been completed in total, with positive retailer partner feedback and successful launches delivered for both services. In our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, 16 campaigns have been delivered for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. In ATMs, there are some early signs of progress from the actions already taken in the business with the estate performance now aligned with LINK industry transaction data. In addition to the recovery plan already implemented at the beginning of the year, we have completed a thorough strategic review of this business, with plans underway to optimise sites across the network driven by data and supported by our enhanced maintenance and support partnership with NoteMachine. In Cards, we continue to strengthen the operating foundation to the business with a greater focus on optimising profitability per merchant: a continued strong performance in Telesales, a reset of our Field sales approach and head count, further processes to support early life merchant experience and churn management, further proposition enhancements for merchants, supported by the improvements to pricing governance, time to transact and customer onboarding delivered in the last financial year. Proposition enhancements for merchants include an updated terminal application enabling split bill and digital receipt functionality, real-time transaction data now live in our merchant mobile app and app registrations in total on course to exceed our target of 10,000 merchants by the end of FY26. We now have 6 integrations and partnerships live for merchants to access our services. In October 2025, we launched our new e-comm product, in partnership with Global Payments, including Pay By Link functionality in the app and integration with major shopping carts. Over H2, there is an active roadmap of future proposition enhancements which will be delivered, including Tap to Pay in app, 7-day settlement and the launch of a ‘Pay Once’ proposition. We have also delivered a positive performance for Business Finance via YouLend, with over £14.6 million of funding provided to businesses, up 58% year on year. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service for the Lloyds Banking Group on 26 August 2025, enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has successfully built on our existing neobank deposit service and has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. Looking ahead to H2, a second major bank is now going live later than planned in Q4 FY26 and we have plans in progress to enable more High St banks for the service over the course of the next 6 months, as well as enabling a more extensive use of our Counter Cash withdrawal service. In addition, we are well underway with plans to develop and launch an SME solution for cash deposits in 2026. Across the whole division, data analytics is now central to how we operate, make decisions, and deliver value to customers and partners. Analytics have been embedded into decision-making for external clients and retail partners, combining multiple sources like regional performance, demographic insights, and usage patterns. This unified view is a major step forward, and there is the opportunity to refine these models further, expand data sources, and improve predictive accuracy in the future. Our algorithms now recommend tailored product mixes for retailers and identify promotions that drive sales and partner returns, with our investment in AI and machine learning opening the door to further development of predictive analytics, enabling teams to act on insights quickly and effectively. The work ahead in this area will unlock even greater visibility, efficiency, and value for our customers, partners and the business as a whole. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, there continues to be strong momentum for Collect+, with net revenue +7.5% at £8.6 million and parcel transactions growing to 74.3 million. Collect+ is well-established as the leading Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK and, as an open network, we will continue to work closely with our carrier partners to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK. In the half year, we have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,274 sites in new locations and demographics, including a new partnership with Gridserve, the leading EV charging network. As announced on 30 September 2025, Royal Mail has now taken a strategic investment in Collect+. Over 3,000 sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collecting, sending and returning parcels. This will form part of over 8,000 sites that will feature Royal Mail Shop branding over the next 6 months. In addition, we have now launched the sale of stamps across the 8,000 sites, including a retail exclusive set of 4 Christmas Stamps available at Royal Mail Shops. Over the next 12 months, the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. This partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK, again enhancing our retailer and consumer propositions delivering vital services at the heart of communities across the UK. In the half, we have also signed a new 3-year commercial agreement with InPost and Yodel, including the potential to utilise up to 6,000 Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) locations within Collect+ network. We had underappreciated the disruptive impact of the InPost/Yodel harmonisation and subsequent logistical challenges in our parcels business but took proactive operational actions to mitigate impact this disruption, including establishing priority routing and collections for high volume stores, dedicated PUDO-only routes and regular communications with affected stores. We expect these actions have now addressed the operational issues in the network, resulting in volumes recovering as we enter the peak trading period. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 17.2% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Peabody, RHP, Orwell Housing Association and Gloucester City Homes, and in the Charity sector with Thames Hospice and Firefighter’s Charity. There continues to be a focus on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. Our Open Banking solutions are unlocking further pipeline opportunities, supporting major clients with cheque replacement solutions via our PayPoint OpenPay service and our new Suspense Manager solution, tackling the issue of unallocated customer payments. In Open Banking, we have made further progress in executing on our strategy. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 70 clients now live for our services, including the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments, and AccessPay for Confirmation of Payee and Thirteen Group live for PISP. In obconnect, we have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with VoP in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY25 and into next year. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for both PayPoint and obconnect. In our cash through to digital category, we have now rolled out new display units to a further 2,000 sites, combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. We intend to expand further the number of stores offering Love2shop physical gift cards and our digital Pin on Receipt brands over the course of H2. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, with sales +54% year on year, and the continuing success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. In addition, our existing neobank cash deposit service processed over £342 million of deposits in the half, complementing our new BankLocal service for High St banks. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 17.7% for the half year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient. Over the half year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at £1,803 for April to June 2025 and £1,672 for July to September 2025. However, the price cap has been confirmed in the current quarter at £1,707 for pre-pay customers for October to December 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, Love2shop continues to trade in line with expectations for the current year, with net revenue in H1 affected by the changes to the timing of revenue recognition for expiry of cards following the adoption of a more prudent accounting treatment in FY24. Under the previous policy ‘end of life’ revenue was recognised progressively over the life of the card. Proactive management of this accounting change ahead of the current financial year will result in a stronger H2 performance as the expiry dates of cards issued in prior periods are weighted towards the second half of the current year. While this change results in the deferral of revenue to the expiry date, it has no material impact on the total revenue expected over the life of the cards. Overall, the Love2shop division has had a solid half year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in our partnership with InComm Payments. In Love2shop Business, we have delivered a positive performance, with billings +5.8% at £70.9 million (H1 FY25: £67.0 m), driven by a strong performance within Major Accounts and Platform sales. We are also leveraging AI across the business to better drive and target marketing engagement and new campaigns, with positive early results contributing to new business pipelines. Highstreetvouchers.com continues to trade in line with expectations. We have delivered a strong half year from our InComm Payments partnership, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5% since launch in October 2024. We have also made further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, supported by our new Store Growth Specialist team, with sales in this channel +54% year on year. Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2Shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026. Park Christmas Savings billings are expected to be broadly flat year on year for the Christmas 2025 season, against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. This has been supported by a strengthened Agent proposition, including the launch of Agent Perks and a new Agent App with over 13,000 downloads, an improved average order value for returning direct savers, and the launch of a more premium fulfilment experience and packaging for customers receiving orders for Christmas 2025. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform, processed £81.2 million in gift card value in in the half year (H1 FY25: £40.9 million), reflecting continued strong momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards DETAIL ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE IDS TRANSACTION The net proceeds of £34.1m on the £43.9m IDS investment in Collect+ is after deducting associated costs of £0.4m and £9.4m of tax from the gain on disposal. These proceeds were distributed in the form of a special dividend of 50 pence per share for c. 69 million eligible shares on 31 October 2025, with a resulting payment of £34.5m. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. This investment entitles IDS to a 49% minority share of the profits of Collect+ Brand Limited, which as part of the transaction now includes all revenues and associated costs from the wider E-commerce division, with the previous holding company (Collect+ Holdings Limited) prepared for dissolution. The Board anticipates the transaction as a whole to be EPS enhancing in the first full year to March 2027 through a combination of the special dividend, share consolidation and expected growth in volumes from the Royal Mail services through the Collect+ network. EPS enhancement assumptions include investment costs associated with the branding of the 8,000 Royal Mail sites, technology to support over the counter services, plus the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. UPDATE ON ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME As announced in our full year results in June 2025, an important step to the delivery of growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, the Group has recently completed the second phase of a project being supported by Nile, an independent consultancy firm. The key outputs from this phase have been the establishment of a target state framework for three key processes: onboarding, customer support, and billings and settlement. For each of these, key outcomes from moving to the target future state have been established. For example, in the case of onboarding, substantially reducing time taken to onboard new customers. In addition, for each process, this phase has quantified the benefits from moving to this future state, including both financial benefits (increased revenue, lower costs, lower operational risk events) and non-financial benefits (e.g. improved customer service/ satisfaction levels). Preliminary estimates have highlighted at least £2 million of operating profit upside, through a combination of reduced costs and improved net revenue, with the potential to grow this figure further through the next phase of work, which will include identifying technical solutions and external providers to support the shift to the future target state, along with the costs associated with this transition. This work is expected to be completed in advance of our full year results announcement in June 2026, with implementation commencing in early FY27. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received a claim from Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. Global 365’s claim was heard at a trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal between 10 June and 11 July 2025. PayPoint is confident that it successfully defended the claim by Global 365 and remains of the view that Global 365’s claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant PayPoint Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The parties are awaiting judgment from the Competition Appeal Tribunal. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year and achieving our medium-term financial goals. Whilst as a business we cannot determine the pace at which new services are adopted by consumers, the delivery of our key projects in the first half of the year is a great reflection of the progress we are making in the delivery of our long-term strategy. Whilst there remain challenges in the broader UK economy and in particular weak consumer confidence and tightening household budgets, we remain focused on the delivery of the key initiatives across the business that will deliver the outcome for the current year and foundations for the longer-term growth in the business. We are now into the most important seasonal trading period for several of our business areas where focused execution is key to the outcome for the current year. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our longer-term objectives have provided a strong platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board has declared an interim dividend of [19.8]p per share, an increase of [2.1]% vs the prior year interim dividend of 19.4p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. Nick WilesChief Executive 19 November 2025 FINANCIAL REVIEW Total revenue increased by £9.1 million (6.7%) to £144.1 million (September 2024: £135.0 million). Net revenue increased by £0.1 million (0.1%) to £84.7 million (September 2024: £84.6 million). The increase in Love2shop revenue was driven by single-retailer redemption products which have an associated cost of revenue and therefore a relatively small impact on net revenue. Total costs increased by £1.3 million to £59.0 million (September 2024: £57.7 million). The increase includes £1.7 million current period obconnect costs (prior period: £nil). There were also increases in cost of sales, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in finance costs, reflecting the Group’s increased borrowing. These impacts were partially offset by lower overhead costs. Exceptional costs are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance. The £3.2 million charge to September 2025 comprises legal fees incurred in defence of claims served against the Group and costs associated with the organisational framework to deliver greater automation and agility. The prior period exceptional cost comprised legal fees in defence of the same claims, plus the accelerated amortisation of certain modules of L2s ERP systems. The underlying profit before tax decreased by £1.2 million (4.5%) to £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). The current period result includes £1.2 million from the Love2shop segment, a decrease of £1.1 million (47.8%) on the prior period’s £2.3 million. The Love2shop decrease reflects the change in expiry date of sold vouchers. The September 2024 result benefitted from significant non-redemption revenue from expiry on vouchers in August 2024, whereas the equivalent non-redemption revenue will be earned in the second half of the current financial year. Profit before tax decreased by £3.2 million (13.9%) to £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). The decrease is mainly due to the £2.7m adjusting item in the prior period for the increase in fair value of the Group’s investments in obconnect, prior to the acquisition of obconnect in October 2024. Underlying EBITDA decreased by £0.2 million to £37.3 million (September 2024: £37.5 million), comprising £33.3 million for the PayPoint segment (September 2024: £32.0 million) and £4.0 million for the Love2shop segment (September 2024: £5.5 million). Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million), delivered from underlying profit before tax of £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. Net corporate debt decreased by £13.4 million to £84.0 million at September 2025 (March 2025: £97.4 million). This is as a result of positive cash generation and proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partly offset by working capital requirements in the first six months along with the exceptional settlement payment, share buy-back and tax, capex and dividend requirements. At 30 September 2025 loans and borrowings were £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million). PAYPOINT SEGMENT Shopping net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million). Service fees net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) driven by the additional PayPoint Mini sites and the annual RPI increase. Cards net revenue decreased by £0.5 million (3.0%); a reduction in acquiring revenue was partially offset by an increase in lending revenue, with rental revenue flat. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £0.2 million (5.0%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million), driven by strong growth in transaction numbers, which increased by 20.0%. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), including £1.9 million net revenue from obconnect, acquired by the Group in October 2024. Excluding the impact of obconnect, net revenue decreased by £0.8 million compared with the prior period. Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million) driven by a 15.1% reduction in transactions caused by reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue, excluding obconnect, increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million). The cost of commission to retailers increased by £1.3 million (6.5%) to £21.3 million (September 2024: £20.0 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of transactions processed and a higher proportion of transactions with higher commission rates. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £2.0 million (4.9%) to £43.2 million, including a £0.9 million increase in finance costs due principally to the share buy-back programme, £1.8 million obconnect costs following acquisition in October 2024, £0.5 million additional depreciation on cards devices, partially offset by a £1.2m decrease in overhead and other costs, reflecting cost saving measures implemented. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services PayPoint provides to retailer partners, which form part of PayPoint’s network, and SME partners. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, card payments, terminal leasing, ATMs, Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million) primarily due to the growth in service fees. The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 30 September 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,962 UK sites, an increase of 2.7% primarily due to new PayPoint mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint One, PayPoint Mini and our legacy terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) to £11.6 million driven by an increase in the number of revenue- generating sites compared to the prior period. Card Payments: Card payments net revenue overall decreased by 3.0% to £16.1 million (September 2024: £16.6 million). Card payments acquiring services generated £10.3 million net revenue in the six-month period, a reduction of £0.9 million from the previous year (September 2024: £11.2 million), reflecting the decrease in the number of SME and retailer partners and in the average value processed per merchant. Card payments lending and other net revenue increased by £0.4 million to £0.6 million. Transaction values overall decreased by 4.4% to £3,428 million (September 2024 £3,585 million). Card payment terminal rentals remained at £5.2 million, with a slight reduction in the number of terminals. Net revenue reduced by £0.2m (5.0%) to £3.8 million (September 2024: £4.0 million) as transactions reduced by 9.4% to 11.5 million. This reflects a continuation of the reduced demand for cash across the economy, although net revenue from Counter Cash was flat. ATM and Counter Cash live sites increased 9.3% to 7,094, reflecting the new local banking service which went live in September 2025. Other: Other shopping services, which includes FMCG voucher campaigns, remained at £1.6 million. E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) due to the continued increase in total parcels transactions, by 20.0% to 74.3 million. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Parcel sites increased by 6.4% to 14,274 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), benefitting from the £1.9 million contribution from obconnect. This was partially offset by the impact of fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash - bill payments and top ups net revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million). Digital (MultiPay, Direct Debits, Cash Out and Open banking) net revenue increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million) and digital transactions increased by 1.8 million (9.0%) to 21.9 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by £0.5 million to £3.4 million (September 2024: £2.9 million) with transactions remaining at 13.9 million. Cashout net revenue decreased by £0.1 million (7.3%) to £1.1 million (September 2024: £1.2 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue increased by £0.1 million (2.9%) to £3.5 million (September 2024: £3.4 million) and transactions increased by 0.7 million (18.2%) to 4.5 million (September 2024: 3.8 million). eMoney transactions derive a substantially higher fee per transaction than traditional top-up transactions as they are more complex to process. Other Payments & Banking net revenue includes SIM sales, interest generated by investing cash received on client funds and other ad-hoc items which contributed £2.7 million (September 2024: £2.6 million) net revenue. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) generated £106.7 million total billings in the period, an increase of 4.6% on the prior period. Billings are a measure of the total value of balance sold on cards and vouchers. The business is seasonal in nature, and profit is primarily generated in the second half of the financial year, which represents the peak trading period of the L2s corporate business and of the dispatch of Park Christmas savings prepaid products prior to Christmas The £5.7 million (11.5%) increase in revenue is largely attributable to single-retailer cards and vouchers, partially offset by a £2.1 million decrease in non-redemption income. The latter reflects the change in the annual expiry date of a significant proportion of cards and vouchers, from the first half of the prior financial year to the second half of the current financial year. Net revenue for the 6 months to 30 September 2025 was £17.0 million, a decrease of £1.8 million (9.6%) on prior period, principally due to the decrease in non-redemption income referred to above. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of £5.0 million (September 2024: £5.8 million) on profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million) represents an effective tax rate of 24.9% (September 2024: 25.1%). This is lower than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to the tax impact of share-based payments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of £102.0 million (September 2024: £104.2 million) decreased by £2.2 million, reflecting the continuation of the share buyback program and dividends, partially offset by profit for the period and the part-disposal of Collect+. Current assets increased by £15.2 million to £364.6 million (September 2024: £349.4 million), mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets of £240.6 million (September 2024: £238.3 million) increased by £2.3 million, of which £16.6 million arose on the acquisition of obconnect (£12.2 million goodwill, £11.0 million intangible assets, less £6.6 million previously recorded as investments). Partially offsetting this was a £12.3 million decrease in the fair value of the Group’s investments in Yodel. Current liabilities increased by £6.5 million to £364.4 million (September 2024: £357.9 million), including a £7.4 million increase in the share buyback liability. Phase two of the share buy-back programme, which commenced in July 2025, was for £30 million of committed share purchases, compared with £20 million for phase one. Non-current liabilities of £138.9 million (September 2024: £125.6 million) increased by £13.3 million, including a £7.1 million increase in loans and borrowings, a £3.6 million increase in deferred tax, of which £2.5 million arose on the obconnect acquired intangible assets, and a £3.6 million settlement provision. At 30 September 2025 net corporate debt was £84.0 million (September 2024: £86.8 million), a decrease of £13.4 million from the year end position. This derives from positive cash generation and net proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partially offset by tax, capex and dividend requirements, along with an exceptional settlement and share buy-back payments. Total loans and borrowings of £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million), increased by £11.8 million from 31 March 2025, and comprise a £75.0 million non-amortising term loan, £40.0 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.3 million arrangement fees (September 2024: £63.0 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, £45.0 million non-amortising term loan, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.2 million arrangement fees). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow movements during the period. Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million) delivered from profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. The working capital outflow is higher than the prior period outflow, which benefitted from a £3.0 million cash collection from a key account in September 2024. The £10.4 million exceptional settlement payment relates to the Utilita accrual disclosed in the March 2025 financial statements. The £1.5 million pension contribution was to the L2s defined benefit scheme. The £43.5 million inflow from the part-disposal of subsidiary relates to the investment by IDS in the Group’s parcel division and is net of disposal costs. The £13.0 million share buyback outflow in the period exceeds the £4.4 million in the prior period, which included only 3 months’ share purchases of a lower annual committed amount than the current period commitment. Capital expenditure of £10.5 million (September 2024: £8.9 million) was £1.6 million higher than the prior period, primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems and Love2shop’s e-commerce project. DIVIDENDS In the six months to 30 September 2025, total dividend payments were £13.9 million or 19.6 pence per share (September 2024: £13.9 million or 19.2 pence per share), representing the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2025. This is a 2.1% increase on the final dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2024. On 17 October 2025 the Group approved a special dividend of 50.0 pence per share, paid on 29 October 2025 to shareholders on the register on 17 October 2025, representing c. 69 million eligible shares. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. We have declared an increased interim dividend of 19.8 pence per share (September 2024: 19.4 pence) payable in equal instalments of 9.9 pence per share on 19 December 2025 and 27 March 2026 (to shareholders on the register on 28 November 2025 and 27 February 2026 respectively). This is an increase of 1.0% compared to the final dividend declared of 19.6 pence per share, and an increase of 2.1% compared to 19.4 pence per share interim dividend for prior year. In aggregate, the special dividend and interim dividends will result in £46.9 million (September 2024: £13.9 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 30 September 2025, had approximately £101.4 million (September 2024: £67.9 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Board’s immediate priority is to continue to preserve PayPoint’s balance sheet strength. The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends.

Accounting policies Reporting entity PayPoint plc (‘PayPoint’ or the ‘Company’) is a public limited company, incorporated and registered in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered office is at Unit 1, The Boulevard, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, AL7 1EL. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) as at and for the six months ended 30 September 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). They were approved for issue on 20 November 2025. These interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the board of directors on 11 June 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statements under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been reviewed, not audited. Basis of preparationThe interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. Adoption of standards and policiesThe accounting policies applied by the Group in the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 are consistent with those set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provide sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 30 September 2025, the Group had corporate cash of £30.1 million. On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to its borrowing facilities, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 30 September 2025, £40.0 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility (30 September 2024: £63.0 million). The Group’s statement of financial position shows net assets of £102.0 million as at 30 September 2025 (£104.2 million as at 30 September 2024), having made a profit after tax for the period of £14.9 million (30 September 2024: £17.3 million) and delivered cash from operations of £20.8 million for the period (30 September 2024: £36.4 million). The Group has net current assets of £0.2 million at 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: net current liabilities of £8.5 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these interim financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. In addition to the ‘base case’ scenario, the Directors have prepared a ‘downside’ scenario which includes the following assumptions: Shopping E-commerce Payments and banking Love2shop Even with the above assumptions, the forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom and liquidity for the Group to continue with its existing borrowing facilities. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on deposit The nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Following the Love2shop acquisition, it also holds card and voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers, some of which is held in trust. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time; and(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the Consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the Consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows. Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 are as follows: Clients’ own fundsClients’ cash held in trust off the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 is £50.8 million (30 September 2024: £49.4 million). Alternative performance measuresNon-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the alternative performance measures disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. These measures are included in these interim financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They usually exclude the impact of one-off, non- recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group’s statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: See note 5 for explanations of the above exceptional items. Love2Shop billings (non-IFRS measures relating solely to the Love2Shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the period and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to billings being recognised at a different time to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‘net’ basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‘gross’ basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity of principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group’s strategy. A reconciliation from revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, financing income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on convertible loan notes. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reportingThe Group considers its Love2shop business to be a separate segment from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and it offers different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for both Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. The Group operates exclusively in the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of £11.5 million (September 2024: £10.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and up-front lump sum payments of £0.7 million (September 2024: £0.7 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. Multi-retailer non-redemption revenue is recognised when the product has expired (and, where applicable, when the right of refund has lapsed). The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on fourteen-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop’s corporate customers is fifteen-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of £6.5 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting period, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction prices in the period to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Seasonality of operationsFollowing the Group’s acquisition of Love2shop on 28 February 2023, its performance is now considered “highly seasonal” under IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The Love2shop business is heavily weighted towards the second half of the financial year, in particular the peak September to December pre-Christmas period when revenues from card, voucher and e-code redemptions are at their highest. The PayPoint business is far less seasonal, although its e-commerce division also generates its highest revenues in the pre- Christmas months. Bill payment transactions, which were historically higher during the winter months (H2), continue to be impacted by the shift in consumer behaviour towards making fewer, larger payments and structural changes in this market. Card payments typically generate higher value processed and revenue in the summer months (H1). Card terminal leasing revenue is relatively unaffected by seasonality. Other revenue Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs excluding adjusting items 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is £0.79 million (September 2024: £0.62 million) Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Legal feesThe current period legal fees relate to the Group’s defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem as a resolution of its concerns raised in Ofgem’s Statement of Objections received by the Group in September 2020. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. See note 12. Organisational framework costsThe current period organisational framework costs are fees to a third party engaged to support the Group deliver greater automation and agility. The work is expected to be completed during the year ending 31 March 2027, with total costs expected to exceed £1 million. 6. Tax 7. Earnings per shareBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue as follows: 8. Investments The fair values of the Group’s investments are as follows: No unrealised gains or losses arose in the current or prior period. Judge Logistics LtdJudge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group’s ecommerce parcel business. The Group’s investment in Judge Logistics Ltd is an equity investment of 4.5% of the ordinary share capital. This comprises an initial equity investment purchased for consideration of £100 on 26 July 2024 and a further 3.6% investment arising on conversion of the Group’s £15 million convertible loan note on 17 April 2025. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investments at fair values of £540,000 for the equity investment and £2,159,000 for the convertible loan note, i.e. £2,699,000 in aggregate. At 30 September 2025, based on the Company’s fair value assessment, it has maintained the fair value of its investment at £2,699,000. Aperidata LtdIn May 2024, the Group acquired an equity investment of 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for £0.2 million and purchased a convertible loan note investment in Aperidata Ltd for consideration of £1.0 million. At 31 March 2025 and at 30 September 2025, the Company fair valued the investments at their respective costs. 9. Part-disposal of subsidiaryOn 18 July 2025, the Company disposed of 20% of its investment in a wholly owned subsidiary, Collect+ Brand Ltd, to International Distribution Services plc (“IDS”), a third-party partner in the Group’s e-commerce division. The consideration, net of transaction costs, was £11.9 million. On 30 September 2025, the Company disposed of a further 29% of its investment in Collect+ Brand Ltd to IDS for consideration of £31.6 million, net of transaction costs. Total net consideration received was therefore £43.5 million. The Group retains control of Collect+ Brand Ltd following the above transactions, due to the rights associated with the Group’s remaining 51% ownership. Consequently, the Group continues to account for Collect+ Brand Ltd as a subsidiary. It now also recognises a non-controlling interest, to which 49% of Collect+ Brand Ltd’s post-tax result is attributed in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The combined transaction gave rise to a post-tax gain on disposal of £34.0 million reported within equity, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements (see Consolidated statement of comprehensive income). 10. Share capital, share premium, merger reserve and capital redemption reserve In the current period 140,828 shares were issued (of 1/3p each) for share awards which vested in the period and 7,432 matching shares were issued (of 1/3p each) under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. On 17 October 2025, the Group carried out a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date, following which the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share (see note 13). On 12 June 2025, the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least £30 million of shares per annum, in an extension to the programme which began on 1 July 2025. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group therefore recognised an initial liability for the full amount of £30.2 million (including stamp duty and associated costs) in the current period, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. A total of 1,859,450 shares were purchased in the period, with a nominal value of £6k. This resulted in a reduction in share capital of £6k and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve balance from £7k to £13k. The share premium of £1.0 million (September 2024: £1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of £18.2 million (September 2024: £18.2 million) comprises £1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and £17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 12. Contingent liabilityOfgem statement of objectionsFurther to the update provided on 12 June 2025, the Group’s position remains unchanged: it is confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365, which fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. As a result, no accounting provision has been made for this claims. The Group will continue to update the market on a quarterly basis as part of its financial reporting cycle. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group’s tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting dateShare consolidation and special dividendAt a special general meeting held on 17 October 2025, the Group’s shareholders approved a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date. As a result of the share consolidation, the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share. In all other respects, the new ordinary shares are equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, including their dividend, voting and other rights. At the same special general meeting on 17 October 2025, following approval of the share consolidation, the Group’s shareholders approved a special dividend of 50 pence per new ordinary share, payable to shareholders on the register on that date. The special dividend payment of £34.5 million was made on 31 October 2025. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Our risk management and internal control framework is designed to ensure that the Group maintains an effective and dynamic risk management process which identifies our risk exposures, ensures our programme of mitigating controls operates effectively and provides assurance to our stakeholders that effective risk management is embedded in our operations. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties remain closely aligned to those risks disclosed in the Strategic Report section of its Annual Report for the year ended 31st of March 2025 and are detailed below. RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT We confirm that to the best of our knowledge this set of interim financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted IFRS and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 (indication of important events during the first half and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining half of the year) and DTR 4.2.8 (disclosure of related parties’ transactions and changes therein). Nick Wiles Rob HardingChief Executive Finance Director Independent review report to PayPoint Plc Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements Our conclusionWe have reviewed PayPoint Plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial statements”) in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc for the 6 month period ended 30 September 2025 (the “period”). Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The interim financial statements comprise: The interim financial statements included in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We have read the other information contained in the Interim results and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements. Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review Our responsibilities and those of the directors The Interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
