You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: China Market Update: Hong Kong Climbs Higher

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed despite a stronger U.S. dollar overnight, gold surging, and yesterday’s U.S. equity downdraft, as Taiwan underperformed. The Yen was resilient, giving some validation to today’s Financial Times article on Japanese institutions selling U.S. Treasuries, though it is hard to say for sure. The U.S. dollar’s decline, stock market decline, and asset flow out of the U.S. were topics in Chinese media, though likely being repeated globally. The positions of star active fund managers, revealing their positions, garnered attention on a light economic data and policy day. One manager’s top positions were revealed as Tencent, Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, Meituan, Wuliangye, Yum China, and CNOOC. Another manager focused solely on Mainland China A shares revealed holdings in Sokon, Eve, Naura, and Trina Solar. After the close, Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the financial arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, updated its positions in four Mainland equity ETFs with increases of 363 million shares, 501 million shares, 117 million shares, and 157 million shares. The SWF’s positions are in the tens of billions, so the Q1 increases aren’t massive in my opinion. Coincidentally, Reuters published an article on retail investors and the National Team buying during market hours that garnered attention. There continues to be coverage of the government’s rare statements on stabilizing the stock market. Hong Kong’s volumes were strong on a positive day. JD.com was down -6.32% and Meituan was down -4.62%, as they battle for restaurant delivery, which weighed on both stocks as investors fear margin compression. The outcome of these pyrrhic victories has been painful to watch, as firms undercut one another to garner market share, as profitability falls to the wayside. This reminds me of the battle between Uber and Didi. Mainland investors bought a very large net $2.753 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, Tencent, and Alibaba were the largest beneficiaries of inflows. 50% of Hong Kong turnover was from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Healthcare was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, up +6.52%, and Mainland China, up +0.49%, on the belief that the sector will be resilient to the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland technology and growth stocks, including electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and electrical equipment, underperformed. A sell-side economist dropped their 2025 China GDP target to 4% from 4.5%. Hong Kong and Mainland China’s resilience has garnered shockingly little attention from global investors. The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target visited President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday. While the companies’ statements called the meeting “productive” and “constructive,” the companies and their customers will unfortunately be adversely impacted by tariffs. Hopefully, the U.S. and China can make some progress, as some have speculated that Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s visit to Beijing could be his attempt to act as a bridge between the two sides.

Title: Tesla wants to bring the Cybertruck down to earth

Good morning. A new research paper co-authored by Google's David Silver is the talk of the tech industry. It boldly announces a radical new era for AI — it also reads as a "dis" of OpenAI, BI's Alistair Barr writes. In today's big story, Tesla's highly anticipated earnings report comes after the bell. We're breaking down what Wall Street will be watching — and why Tesla really wants the Cybertruck to be a working man's truck. What's on deck Markets: President Trump escalated his feud with the Fed, and investors are nervous. Tech: Internal Microsoft email to managers details new policies aimed at culling low performers. Business: The FTC is arguing that Uber's subscription service is too deceptive in a new suit. But first, bringing the Cybertruck back to earth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The big story Think less DeLorean, more F-150. The Cybertruck is ditching its otherworldly aesthetic to reposition itself as a working man's vehicle, BI's Grace Kay writes. Less than two years after release, Cybertrucks are now piling up in sales lots, fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered, and some owners have become political targets over CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump. So, what's a car company to do? Enter the quiet rebrand. Tesla sales workers told BI the vehicle needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer. In mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars. Now, the vehicle is fit for construction work or a family outing. Tesla is preparing to deliver first-quarter earnings. It faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% this year. It's looking for a boost. Here are a few things that Wall Street will be watching: Impact of Trump tariffs. Tesla's chief financial officer said on the company's last earnings call that, if implemented, tariffs would affect the automaker's business and profitability. He said that while the company had tried to localize its supply chain, it's still "very reliant on parts from across the world" for all its businesses. 1. The "sell America" trade is in full swing. On Monday, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropped sharply. This followed Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for taking too long to lower interest rates, which is rattling investor confidence. 2. Politically meddling with the Fed is a bad idea, top official says. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee underscored the importance of the central bank's independence on Monday. He cautioned that political interference could result in hotter inflation and higher unemployment. 3. Companies are cutting earnings outlooks. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and recession fears are causing the revisions, which are approaching downside extremes. 1. Inside Amazon's Project Greenland. Last year, Amazon struggled to keep its retail business on track when faced with an AI chip shortage. Its response was Project Greenland: an effort to tightly approve and monitor which projects get GPU access, according to documents obtained by BI. 2. Microsoft is raising the bar. It has created new policies and tools to dial up performance pressure on employees, including a two-year rehire ban for those found to be underperforming, according to an internal email viewed by BI. 3. AI isn't ready to do your job. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University staffed a fake company with AI agents, and the results were disastrous. See the tasks AI failed the most — and where the next development phase is likely headed. 1. Are you stuck with Uber One? You're probably not alone. An FTC lawsuit accuses Uber of overpromising customers how much the paid subscription service will save them, making it too hard to cancel, and, in some cases, signing them up without consent. Uber denies the allegations. 2. Walmart's taking a page from the honeybee playbook. The retail giant is ditching zip codes for a honeycomb-style segmented map in search of speedier grocery delivery. It says the goal is to understand what customers want, where they are, and which stores have what they need. 3. How CEOs are staying calm. As uncertainty swirls over tariffs, many CEOs are turning to their wellness routines to reduce stress. Business leaders shared their tips with BI, from "purposeful scrolling" to finding balance outdoors.

Title: There’s method in King Donald’s ‘madness’ on China

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 8:14:14 PM PDT by cold start Don’t go by the defiant rhetoric, China is hurting and in deep trouble over Trump’s tariffsFor the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson For the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent.

These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation.

One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month.

This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny.

Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating.

If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

(Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property.

This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods.

These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Title: Tesla’s caught in a trade war trap. Blame Elon Musk

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Hertz Stock Up 131% On Ackman’s Iffy Bet Tariffs To Boost Car Value

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI American actor Peter Falk at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, 1982. (Photo by ... More Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images) Many investors have bet against car rental company Hertz Global. But activist investor Bill Ackman has built a 19.8% stake in the company, according to an April 16 Pershing Square Capital regulatory filing, the Globe and Mail reported. Since April 15, Hertz stock – about 40% of the company’s shares are sold short, according to the Wall Street Journal – have surged 131%. Is now a great time to buy Hertz stock? Here are four reasons to steer clear of these shares: Hertz is pleased with Ackman’s investment. “I am humbled, and we should all feel encouraged by Bill Ackman’s comments and energized by the strong support shown by him,” Hertz CEO Gil West said in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters. Ackman warned investors to be wary of the stock even as he argued Hertz – which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and now has two business lines: renting vehicles and borrowing heavily to own vehicles -- is undervalued, noted the Globe And Mail. I requested a comment from Hertz and will update this post if I receive a response. On social media, Ackman – who has a large following among individual investors and owns a big stake in Uber – gave three reasons why shares of Hertz could be worth $30 per share by 2029, the Globe And Mail reported. These include the following: While Ackman is right about the industry structure being concentrated, his numbers appear high. Rather than 95% of the market, their combined market share is 83% – Enterprise (39%), Hertz (22%), and Avis/Budget (22%), according to Market.us. Also, I question how successful Hertz’s turnaround is and whether tariffs and the Uber/Hertz partnership will boost Hertz’s value. After hosting a revolving door of CEOs, Hertz has recently contracted unprofitably. Hertz entered bankruptcy in May 2020 and emerged on July 1, 2021, under Paul Stone’s leadership – "returning about $8 a share to stockholders in its exit from chapter 11," noted the Journal. Mark Fields, who served as interim CEO from October 5, 2021, made the decision for Hertz to order 100,000 Teslas. Despite TV ads from Tom Brady promoting the Tesla fleet, consumers did not take the bait, the Journal reported. Hertz’s operating costs rose and in February 2022 Fields was replaced by Goldman Sachs veteran Stephen Scherr who built up the EV fleet. In December 2022, Hertz took a "$168 million charge to settle 364 claims related to the company falsely reporting rental cars as stolen," according to CNN. On April 1, 2024, West – who was previously Delta Airlines chief operating officer -- replaced Scherr as CEO. West cut operating costs by selling a large portion of Hertz’s EV fleet and the associated remote charging network – taking a $200 million writedown, the Journal wrote. The EV blunder reduced Hertz’s earnings, and the company has reported net losses for the last couple of years – including quarterly losses for the most recent five quarters ending December 2024. Moreover, during that time the rental car company’s debt load has increased 6% to $18.3 billion, its equity has plunged 95% to $153 million, and its revenue fell 6% to about $2 billion in the final quarter of 2024, noted the Journal. Ackman sees tariffs boosting the value of Hertz’s fleet of used late-model vehicles. He als0 expects a partnership with Uber to increase the companies’ fleet utilization and profitability. He forecasts President Donald Trump’s 25% levy on imported automobiles will boost the value of Hertz’s 500,000 vehicles by 10% – increasing their value to $13.2 billion. Moreover, the “$1.2 billion gain on its auto assets is equivalent to approximately half of the company’s current market capitalization,” Ackman said in an X post featured by Bloomberg. Ackman’s 10% is at the high end of a range of used car price increase estimates. For example, one analyst expects used car prices to rise between a 5% and 10% in the near future, according to iSeeCars. Of course if that happens, I doubt Ackman expects Hertz to sell all 500,000 of those vehicles. So, as the company replaces older vehicles with new ones subject to tariffs, it is unclear how much of that $1.2 billion value increase the company will capture. Ackman is counting on West to boost Hertz’s stock price. Getting there would require the company to reach the CEO’s operating targets which include $1,500 in revenue per unit, around $30-per-vehicle operating expense, about $300 in depreciation per unit, and an increase in fleet utilization from 80% to 85%, Ackman noted on X. Ackman also floated the idea of Hertz managing a fleet of self-driving vehicles – in its 11,200 global locations – for Uber which is “excited to brainstorm on how we can expand on our relationship,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi posted on X. I question the realism of West’s operating targets. Many economists see tariffs causing an economic slowdown. If that happens, consumers and businesses could cut back on travel – thus lowering Hertz’s revenue per unit. Moreover, with tariffs raising the price of auto parts, vehicle operating expenses could go up rather than fall. Hertz faces other threats – notably a $272 million legal judgment from bondholders who claim the company should have paid them interest during its time in chapter 11. Hertz is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court. “While the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resumption of global travel rendered Hertz solvent despite the high stakes of this dispute, the nearly $272 million at issue here could make the difference between solvency and insolvency in many cases,” Hertz lawyers wrote in an April 4 petition to the high court featured in a Bloomberg report. Bondholders remain wary of Hertz’s junior bonds. They still trade “around 50 or 60 cents on the dollar,” the Journal reported. Hertz shares are way overvalued in the view of Wall Street. Four analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $2.93 – suggesting the rental car company stock is 181% over-valued. Short sellers may have contributed to this overvaluation by scrambling to repay the shares they borrowed – assuming some of them purchased the stock in a rising market following Ackman’s announcement of his 19.8% stake. I agree with Ackman’s concluding thoughts. “Investing is risky,” he wrote on X. “There are no guarantees of a successful outcome. Caveat emptor.” Consider avoiding Hertz stock.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street.

Title: Bill Ackman Is Betting on Car Rental Giant Hertz to be a Tariff Winner

President Trump’s auto tariffs may have sparked fears of price hikes among consumers, but some car-buying businesses could actually benefit, according to investor Bill Ackman. The Pershing Square Capital Management founder made a bullish case for Hertz yesterday (April 17), after revealing a nearly 20 percent stake in the car rental company. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Hertz is uniquely well-positioned in the current tariff environment,” Ackman wrote in a post on X. As 25 percent levies on imported cars drive up used car prices, the value of Hertz’s fleet—around 500,000 vehicles worth roughly $1.2 billion—will rise in tandem, he argued. A 10 percent increase in used car values would boost the company’s fleet value by $1.2 billion, nearly half of Hertz’s current market cap. Shares of Hertz surged more than 44 percent following the disclosure of Ackman’s 19.8 percent stake. Hertz has had its fair share of troubles in the past few years. After declaring bankruptcy in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company pivoted hard to electric vehicles—placing a costly bet on Tesla that fell flat due to soft demand. In February, Hertz reported a $2.9 billion loss for 2024 and said it had sold off 30,000 EVs from its fleet. Ackman, who began building his position in the company last year, is betting on a successful turnaround—and a stock price that could more than triple to $30 per share by 2029. That task falls in the hands of Hertz’s new CEO Gil West, who stepped into the role in early 2024. West is focused on “rotating Hertz’s fleet, increasing unit revenues, and reducing operating costs” to “significantly improve profit margins over the next several years,” Ackman said. In a note to employees today (April 18), West praised Ackman’s support and described it as an “testament to our progress,” according to Bloomberg. Ackman also highlighted Hertz’s advantageous position in an “oligopoly.” He noted that Hertz and its two rivals, Enterprise and Avis, currently control around 95 percent of the car rental market. Praising Enterprise as the best-run of the trio, Ackman pointed to its estimated 20 percent profit margin as evidence “that the car rental business can be very profitable.” Ackman floated the possibility of a partnership between Hertz and Uber (UBER)—another company Pershing Square has taken a sizable stake in. “What if [Uber] partnered with Hertz on an [autonomous vehicle] fleet roll out over time?” he suggested, hinting at a potential conversation with Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. With its large fleet, global footprint and expertise in vehicle maintenance, Hertz would “make it an ideal partner” for Uber, Ackman said. Uber seems open to the idea. “Hertz has been a great partner of ours,” Khosrowshahi responded on X. “Excited to brainstorm on how we can expand our relationship!” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.
