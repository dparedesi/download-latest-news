A new study suggests that Uber pulled off quite a feat — raising fares, lowering driver pay, and increasing profits — with a subtle change in pricing. The analysis, which is based on a trove of data from a single driver, offers some insight into a strategy that the researchers say explains the company's financial turnaround. In 2022, Uber moved away from a formula based largely on the length of a trip and started rolling out what it calls "upfront pricing," which gives a price to riders and potential earnings to drivers before they accept a trip. Behind the scenes, Uber's algorithms use a variety of factors, not just the length of the trip and demand, to determine rider prices and driver earnings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has touted upfront pricing's ability to offer specific prices based on the company's data and AI analysis. "Anyone can price based on time and distance," he said during a quarterly earnings call in late 2023. "We'll be able to price out that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger dataset than anyone else in the world." These days, upfront pricing is standard in most parts of the US and many of Uber's international markets. The strategy may be the secret ingredient behind Uber's 300% stock rally over the past three years, a new study indicates. Upfront pricing has been "enabling the company to raise rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of rideshare trips, systematically, selectively, and opaquely," Len Sherman, an executive in residence and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the report released Monday. The study, which is based on about seven years of trip data from one driver, found that changes to fares and driver pay could vary by trip. Sherman's report said that Uber had come close to being a master of what economists call "price discrimination," or determining the exact maximum that riders are willing to pay — or the exact minimum that a driver is willing to accept — for a trip. The term doesn't refer to discrimination based on race, sex, or other personal characteristics, but rather discrimination based on a person's needs and desires in a particular situation. It's a concept that economists have talked about in introductory economics courses for decades, but it was largely theoretical, Sherman told Business Insider in an interview. "They cracked the nut," Sherman said. "They have the data and the algorithms and the machine learning to come closer to being able to do that than anyone else." Since implementing upfront pricing, Uber's stock price has risen nearly fourfold from a low of about 40% below its initial public offering price. In 2023, for the first time in its history, Uber reported an annual profit. The performance rally helped Khosrowshahi secure the option to buy about $130 million in additional Uber stock early last year, as part of an incentive plan. In a statement at the end of Sherman's report, Uber said its upfront pricing strategy was "designed it be transparent and fair for both riders and drivers." The company also said its pricing algorithms "do not use information about an individual rider or driver's personal characteristics." In a statement to BI, an Uber spokesperson called Sherman's findings "a tired, misleading story." When Uber first launched, the compensation model used a rate card, with pay based on the length of trips. Under upfront pricing, drivers' earnings have plummeted, even as the costs of working as a ride-hailing driver, such as gas and car maintenance, have increased, the study found. Many of Sherman's findings come from an analysis of one driver's trip data — information that Uber allows drivers to download. The information includes details about how much the driver got paid, how much Uber charged the rider, and how long each trip was. The worker whose data Sherman used was described as a "power driver." The study examined just under 25,000 trips that this driver completed while working close to full time for Uber between 2018 and February 2025. The driver saw pay cuts starting in September 2022, around the time Uber rolled out upfront pricing, the study found. Over the preceding two years, many drivers had seen their pay increase while driving during the pandemic, the report said. "We've seen this kind of narrative before — one driver's data and a lot of speculation spun into a sweeping indictment," an Uber spokesperson said. "The facts are simpler: upfront pricing is designed to increase clarity for both riders and drivers, not to manipulate them." If Uber can apply these methods to one driver, Sherman said, it has an incentive to do the same across a wide swath of its contractors. "The question, therefore, isn't whether our profiled driver is truly representative of all US drivers," Sherman wrote, "but rather, given Uber's massive profit improvement revealed by our analysis, why wouldn't Uber seek to exploit the same levers across its entire pool of over one million drivers in the US?" One Uber driver in New York state told BI he used to get more than 50% of fares when he drove for Uber. Since Uber introduced upfront pricing in his area, though, he has seen his cut — and, usually, his total pay from trips — fall, usually to less than 30% of the total fare. The driver shared screenshots and notes of payouts from his recent trips. The gap between what riders pay and what he makes becomes apparent when he strikes up conversations in his car. "They'll tell you that they paid Uber $60, and you're lucky if you get $20," the driver told BI. One of the clearest pieces of evidence for Uber's use of price discrimination came when Sherman compared his driver's rides from 2019 with those from 2024. In 2019, almost all of the driver's trips — 98% — had predictable pay based on distance, travel time, and any surge pricing that was in effect at the time. By 2024, though, that number had dropped to 77%, a sign that Uber had given itself "considerable wiggle room to maximize profits by adjusting prices and pay on every trip," Sherman wrote. The analysis focused on the driver's actual earnings and wasn't affected by fees, such as airport pickup fees, that drivers sometimes incur but Uber reimburses, Sherman said. Perhaps the biggest financial impact of Uber's upfront pricing, the study suggests, is on the percentage of each fare that the company claims — a metric known as "take rate." Uber doesn't regularly report its take rate in earnings. Sherman estimated it by comparing the rider price per mile in the data with the driver's pay. When upfront pricing began in 2022, the rides that Sherman's driver took had a take rate of about 32%. By the end of 2024, the take rate stood at about 42%. On some trips that Sherman examined, Uber took more than 50% of the fare. Sherman determined that the lack of transparency around pricing with the new model could have allowed Uber to increase take rates. How much Uber takes from each fare is a frequent topic of discussion for ride-hailing drivers and their passengers. "Drivers are obsessed with it," Sherman said. Determining how they're splitting a fare with Uber is an important factor for ride-hailing drivers who are deciding whether the job is worth it, said Sergio Avedian, an Uber driver who's a senior contributor to The Rideshare Guy, a gig driver advocacy blog and YouTube channel. "There is no other math," he said. Uber's upfront pricing also raised fares for short trips that the driver took, Sherman found. Longer trips, meanwhile, became a comparatively good deal for riders, which could have spurred riders to use Uber for longer trips instead of only quick hops around town, he said. "Uber's upfront pricing policy thus unlocked a trifecta of profit improvement: higher margins applied to higher-priced trips plus a shift to longer, more profitable trips," the report said.

Title: Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi rollout faced bumps in the road

Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal. In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin. What's on deck Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience. Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on? Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore. But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin. The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections. The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor. The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions. While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as "Halo," involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said. The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk. At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits. Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000. Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion. 1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another. 2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying. 3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again. 1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US. 2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why. 3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable. 1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez. 2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly. 3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge. Fed Chair Jerome Powell presents semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained ground on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, raising hopes for a more sustained drawdown in hostilities. Investors also kept an eye on Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell indicated that the central bank intends to maintain interest rates at their current levels until there is more clarity on tariff policy and its potential economic impact, despite the White House's calls for immediate rate cuts. The S&P 500 gained 1.1%, closing just beneath its record-high level set in February. The Dow was up 1.2%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4%. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., skyrocketed 12.1% on Tuesday to secure the S&P 500's top performance. Analysts at the research firm Benchmark lifted their price target on Coinbase stock, pointing to favorable legislative and regulatory developments and the company's initiatives to capitalize on them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the department would launch a massive advertising campaign to encourage the use of wearable health devices. Kennedy specifically mentioned the benefits of glucose monitors for patients managing diabetes. Shares of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom (DXCM) surged 9.7%. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares jumped 7.5% as the ridesharing company debuted its robotaxi service in Atlanta. Uber's partnership with Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), initially offers service in 65 square miles of Atlanta, around half the city's footprint. Carnival Corporation (CCL) posted better-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter, and the cruise operator's shares sailed 6.9% higher. The company also boosted its full-year profit outlook, pointing to increases in passengers carried and passenger cruise days as well as declining costs. Shares of competitors Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) also advanced. AutoZone (AZO) shares dropped 3.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, following reports that a senior vice president at the auto parts retailer had sold a stake in the company worth more than $2.5 million. Investors often view large sales by company insiders as a negative signal for a stock. Crude oil futures tumbled as optimism around de-escalation in the Middle East helped alleviate potential supply concerns. Shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (OXY) fell 3.3%, while Exxon Mobil shares (XOM) were down 3%. The potential for calming geopolitical tensions also pressured defense stocks. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dropped 3.2%, while shares of aerospace and defense peers RTX Corp. (RTX) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) also traded lower.

Title: Stocks Near All-Time High as Oil Prices Tumble

US stocks climbed near their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel's war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 rallied 1.1% Tuesday and got back within 0.8% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4%. Oil prices fell roughly 6% and are below where they were before the Israel-Iran conflict began, the AP reports. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. President Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, says Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious. He said again in testimony delivered to Congress Tuesday that the Fed is "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." But he did indicate the next move is likely to be a cut. Asked whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, "We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later—but I wouldn't want to point to a particular meeting."

Title: Oil prices tumble, and Wall Street nears its record in a worldwide rally for stocks

WFTV Now NEW YORK — (AP) — U.S. stocks rose toward their all-time high on Tuesday after oil prices eased further on hopes that Israel’s war with Iran will not damage the global flow of crude. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1%, following up on big gains for stocks across Europe and Asia, after President Donald Trump said late Monday that Israel and Iran had agreed to a "complete and total ceasefire." The main measure of Wall Street's health is back within 0.8% of its record set in February after falling roughly 20% below during the spring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 507 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.4%. The strongest action was again in the oil market, where a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 6% to settle at $64.37. Brent crude, the international standard, had a similar drop. The fear throughout the Israel-Iran conflict has been that it could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would pump up prices for gasoline and hurt the global economy. Iran is a major producer of crude, and it could also try to block the Strait of Hormuz off its coast, through which 20% of the world's daily oil needs passes on ships. Oil prices began falling sharply on Monday after Iran launched what appeared to be a limited retaliatory strike to the United States' entry into the war, one that did not target the production or movement of oil. They kept falling even after attacks continued past a deadline to stop hostilities early Tuesday. Trump later said that the ceasefire was "in effect." Oil prices have dropped so much in the last two days that they’re below where they were before the fighting began nearly two weeks ago. With the global oil market well supplied and the OPEC+ alliance of producing countries steadily increasing production, oil prices could be headed even lower as long as the ceasefire holds and a lasting peace solution can be found, said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Falling oil prices should take some pressure off inflation, and that in turn could give the Federal Reserve leeway to resume cutting interest rates. Wall Street loves lower rates because they boost the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money to buy a car or build a factory. But they could also give inflation more fuel. That threat is why the Fed has been hesitant to cut rates this year after lowering them through the end of last year. The Fed has said repeatedly that it wants to wait and see how much Trump's tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation before committing to its next move. So far, the economy seems to be holding up OK, though a report on confidence among U.S. consumers came in weaker than economists expected on Tuesday, and inflation has remained only a bit above the Fed's 2% target. Trump has been pushing loudly for more cuts to rates. And two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they may consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed's next meeting next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains more cautious, though he he did indicate Tuesday that the Fed's next move is likely to be a cut. Asked during testimony before a Congressional committee whether a reduction could arrive as soon as July, Powell said, “We will get to a place where we cut rates, sooner rather than later – but I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.” That helped Treasury yields ease in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.34% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.81% from 3.84%. On Wall Street, cruise operator Carnival steamed 6.9% higher after the cruise operator delivered a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Josh Weinstein said it’s seeing strong demand from people booking cruises close to the departure date, and customers are spending strongly once on board. Carnival also raised its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for the full year. Uber Technologies rose 7.5% after it said customers in Atlanta can use its app to ride in Waymo autonomous vehicles. Coinbase Global rallied 12.1% as the cryptocurrency exchange rose with the price of bitcoin, which jumped back above $105,000. All told, the S&P 500 rose 67.01 points to 6,092.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 507.24 to 43,089.02, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 281.56 to 19,912.53. In stock markets abroad, indexes rallied at least 1% everywhere from France to Germany to Japan following the announcement of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Hong Kong’s jump of 2.1% and South Korea’s leap of 3% were two of the strongest moves. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Build an agentic multimodal AI assistant with Amazon Nova and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation

Time Published: 2025-06-23T17:36:31Z
Full Content:
AWS Blogs Modern enterprises are rich in data that spans multiple modalities—from text documents and PDFs to presentation slides, images, audio recordings, and more. Imagine asking an AI assistant about your company’s quarterly earnings call: the assistant should not only read the transcript but also “see” the charts in the presentation slides and “hear” the CEO’s remarks. Gartner predicts that by 2027, 40% of generative AI solutions will be multimodal (text, image, audio, video), up from only 1% in 2023. This shift underlines how vital multimodal understanding is becoming for business applications. Achieving this requires a multimodal generative AI assistant—one that can understand and combine text, visuals, and other data types. It also requires an agentic architecture so the AI assistant can actively retrieve information, plan tasks, and make decisions on tool calling, rather than just responding passively to prompts. In this post, we explore a solution that does exactly that—using Amazon Nova Pro, a multimodal large language model (LLM) from AWS, as the central orchestrator, along with powerful new Amazon Bedrock features like Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for processing multimodal data. We demonstrate how agentic workflow patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-tool orchestration, and conditional routing with LangGraph enable end-to-end solutions that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) developers and enterprise architects can adopt and extend. We walk through an example of a financial management AI assistant that can provide quantitative research and grounded financial advice by analyzing both the earnings call (audio) and the presentation slides (images), along with relevant financial data feeds. We also highlight how you can apply this pattern in industries like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. The core of the agentic pattern consists of the following stages: This iterative decision-making enables the agent to handle complex requests that are impossible to fulfill with a single prompt. However, implementing agentic systems can be challenging. They introduce more complexity in the control flow, and naive agents can be inefficient (making too many tool calls or looping unnecessarily) or hard to manage as they scale. This is where structured frameworks like LangGraph come in. LangGraph makes it possible to define a directed graph (or state machine) of potential actions with well-defined nodes (actions like “Report Writer” or “Query Knowledge Base”) and edges (allowable transitions). Although the agent’s internal reasoning still decides which path to take, LangGraph makes sure the process remains manageable and transparent. This controlled flexibility means the assistant has enough autonomy to handle diverse tasks while making sure the overall workflow is stable and predictable. This solution is a financial management AI assistant designed to help analysts query portfolios, analyze companies, and generate reports. At its core is Amazon Nova, an LLM that acts as an intelligent LLM for inference. Amazon Nova processes text, images, or documents (like earnings call slides), and dynamically decides which tools to use to fulfill requests. Amazon Nova is optimized for enterprise tasks and supports function calling, so the model can plan actions and call tools in a structured way. With a large context window (up to 300,000 tokens in Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Pro), it can manage long documents or conversation history when reasoning. The workflow consists of the following key components: These components are orchestrated in an agentic workflow. Instead of a fixed script, the solution uses a dynamic decision graph (implemented with the open source LangGraph library in the notebook solution) to route between steps. The result is an assistant that feels less like a chatbot and more like a collaborative analyst—one that can parse an earnings call audio recording, critique a slide deck, or draft an investor memo with minimal human intervention. The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of the agentic AI workflow. Amazon Nova orchestrates various tools—including Bedrock Amazon Data Automation for document and image processing and a knowledge base for retrieval—to fulfill complex user requests. For brevity, we don’t list all the code here; the GitHub repo includes a full working example. Developers can run that to see the agent in action and extend it with their own data. To demonstrate the multi-tool collaboration agent workflow, we explore an example of how a question-answer interaction might flow through our deployed system for multi-tool collaboration: If anything is missing or a tool encountered an error, the FM orchestrator triggers the error handler (up to three retries), then resumes the plan at the failed step. The following figure shows a flow diagram of this multi-tool collaboration agent. This solution is built on Amazon Bedrock because AWS provides an integrated ecosystem for building such sophisticated solutions at scale: You don’t need to assemble a dozen disparate systems; AWS provides an integrated network for generative AI workflows. The architecture demonstrates exceptional flexibility through its modular design principles. At its core, the system uses Amazon Nova FMs, which can be selected based on task complexity. Amazon Nova Micro handles straightforward tasks like classification with minimal latency. Amazon Nova Lite manages moderately complex operations with balanced performance, and Amazon Nova Pro excels at sophisticated tasks requiring advanced reasoning or generating comprehensive responses. The modular nature of the solution (Amazon Nova, tools, knowledge base, and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation) means each piece can be swapped or adjusted without overhauling the whole system. Solution architects can use this reference architecture as a foundation, implementing customizations as needed. You can seamlessly integrate new capabilities through AWS Lambda functions for specialized operations, and the LangGraph orchestration enables dynamic model selection and sophisticated routing logic. This architectural approach makes sure the system can evolve organically while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Bringing it to production requires thoughtful design, but AWS offers scalability, security, and reliability. For instance, you can secure the knowledge base content with encryption and access control, integrate the agent with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to make sure it only performs allowed actions (for example, if an agent can access sensitive financial data, verify it checks user permissions ), and monitor the costs (you can track Amazon Bedrock pricing and tools usage; you might use Provisioned Throughput for consistent high-volume usage). Additionally, with AWS, you can scale from an experiment in a notebook to a full production deployment when you’re ready, using the same building blocks (integrated with proper AWS infrastructure like Amazon API Gateway or Lambda, if deploying as a service). The architecture we described is quite general. Let’s briefly look at how this multimodal agentic workflow can drive value in different industries: These examples highlight a common pattern: the synergy of data automation, powerful multimodal models, and agentic orchestration leads to solutions that closely mimic a human expert’s assistance. The financial AI assistant cross-checks figures and explanations like an analyst would, the clinical AI assistant correlates images and notes like a diligent doctor, and the industrial AI assistant recalls diagrams and logs like a veteran engineer. All of this is made possible by the underlying architecture we’ve built. The era of siloed AI models that only handle one type of input is drawing to a close. As we’ve discussed, combining multimodal AI with an agentic workflow unlocks a new level of capability for enterprise applications. In this post, we demonstrated how to construct such a workflow using AWS services: we used Amazon Nova as the core AI orchestrator with its multimodal, agent-friendly capabilities, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation to automate the ingestion and indexing of complex data (documents, slides, audio) into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and the concept of an agentic workflow graph for reasoning and condition (using LangChain or LangGraph) to orchestrate multi-step reasoning and tool usage. The end result is an AI assistant that operates much like a diligent analyst: researching, cross-checking multiple sources, and delivering insights—but at machine speed and scale.The solution demonstrates that building a sophisticated agentic AI system is no longer an academic dream—it’s practical and achievable with today’s AWS technologies. By using Amazon Nova as a powerful multimodal LLM and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for multimodal data processing, along with frameworks for tool orchestration like LangGraph (or Amazon Bedrock Agents), developers get a head start. Many challenges (like OCR, document parsing, or conversational orchestration) are handled by these managed services or libraries, so you can focus on the business logic and domain-specific needs. The solution presented in the BDA_nova_agentic sample notebook is a great starting point to experiment with these ideas. We encourage you to try it out, extend it, and tailor it to your organization’s needs. We’re excited to see what you will build—the techniques discussed here represent only a small portion of what’s possible when you combine modalities and intelligent agents.

Title: Tesla shares pop 10% as Elon Musk touts ‘successful’ Robotaxi test launch in Texas
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/business/tesla-shares-pop-10-as-elon-musk-touts-successful-robotaxi-test-launch-in-texas/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T16:16:35Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s Robotaxis appeared to violate local traffic laws by exceeding the speed limit and swerving into the wrong lane – even as Elon Musk touted a “successful” launch of his long-delayed self-driving vehicles and shares popped as much as 11% Monday. In one video posted by investor Rob Maurer, a Robotaxi appeared to struggle navigating a left-turn-only lane, briefly crossing over a double yellow line before returning to the proper lane. A human motorist honked at the Robotaxi during the glitch. Meanwhile, Tesla investor and superfan Sawyer Merritt posted a video from his Robotaxi ride in which the driverless car accelerated past 30 mph speed limit during Sunday’s rollout in Austin, Texas. YouTuber Herbert Ong described a similar experience in his video, according to Bloomberg. “It’s going at 39 right now, which is perfect, right, because I don’t want to drive at 35, and it’s driving at the same flow of traffic,” Ong said in the video. “If everyone else is driving at this speed, you want to be at the same speed.” Bloomberg later reported the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking information from Tesla after seeing the online videos of issues on robotaxi after its debut. Despite the apparent hiccups, Tesla shares surged after a handpicked group of influencers who participated in the trial run uploaded positive reviews on X and other social media platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, raved about his experience after taking two approximately 15-minute rides in the state capital. “Going into it, we expected to be impressed but walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future,” Ives said in a note to clients. “The ride itself was completely smooth, and it was indistinguishable that the car was driverless as there was never a moment in the vehicle where we felt as if it did something irrational.” Ives maintained his “outperform” rating for Tesla’s stock and a $500 price target. The electric car maker began offering driverless rides by invitation only on Sunday, with riders charged a $4.20 flat fee — a cheeky nod to marijuana use. About 10 driverless Tesla Model Y SUVs were reportedly on the road, with company “safety monitors” on board in the front seat to oversee the trips. Bearded Tesla Guy, a social media influencer, compared the experience to “basically Uber.” Farzad Mesbahi, a former Tesla employee-turned influencer, said his rides were “very smooth and comfortable.” “Now Tesla needs to scale this service safely,” Mesbahi said on X. “As long as the system performance holds, they should be able to cover the US with Robotaxis virtually overnight.” Robotaxi is set to directly compete with Google-owned Waymo and Amazon-backed Zoox in the autonomous vehicle market. Tesla told US regulators that all of its answers to questions on the safety of its robotaxi deployment in Texas are confidential business information and should not be made public, according to a letter released Monday. On Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was reviewing answers given in response to the agency’s questions about the safety of its self-driving robotaxi in poor weather among other issues. The agency said Monday that federal law “restricts NHTSA’s ability to publicly release what the companies label as confidential.” The agency added that “following an assessment of these responses and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.” On Sunday, Musk shared “super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!!” “Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. Invitations circulated by Tesla said the initial Robotaxi service would be available from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM local time and limited to a geofenced area, meaning anything outside the pre-set boundaries would be off-limits. Tesla also said Robotaxi service would be limited or unavailable in the event of bad weather. Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” technology, though federal regulators and other critics have repeatedly raised safety concerns. He has suggested that autonomous driving technology can add $5 trillion to $10 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization by transforming its vehicles into an instant productive fleet. The billionaire had said the Robotaxi rollout was limited because Tesla was “being super paranoid about safety.” The debut occurred at a critical time for Tesla, whose shares have been under pressure since Musk embarked on his controversial work with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk and Trump had a very public falling-out earlier this month, though the two have since appeared to mend fences. With Post wires Advertisement

Title: I had a comfortable life in Big Tech, but something unsettled me. I quit to start my own company — now I feel more fulfilled.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/quitting-big-tech-entrepreneur-stock-compensation-concentration-risk-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-23T10:03:13Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 41-year-old Srikanth Narayan, the CEO and founder of Cache, from the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My career began in San Francisco. I've been in Silicon Valley ever since, working at both startups and Big Tech companies. In 2021, after roughly eight years working at Uber and then Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, I decided it was the right time to take a leap and become an entrepreneur. I had built a healthy financial cushion and was ready to take a risk and create a new company. I noticed a problem around Big Tech compensation — concentration risk. I saw an opportunity to help build a solution and educate employees on this risk. Entrepreneurship has been a lot harder than working in Big Tech, but I've found it far more fulfilling. Prior to founding Cache, I spent most of my career focusing on data visualization. In 2014, Uber recruited me to lead a data visualization application suite. I stayed at Uber for six years and eventually became a staff engineer. If you work at a company like Uber for a long time, a lot of your compensation is in the form of stock, sometimes outsizing your cash compensation. As the company grows and does well, your net worth grows in line with the stock. This creates wealth for the people who hold that stock, but having way too much of your net worth in a few stocks means you're taking undue risk. Take Tesla. In recent months, some people who worked at Tesla may have seen their net worth fluctuate due to the changing value of the company's stock. People tend to hold on to these massive stock positions due to inertia and because the taxes for reallocating stock can be very expensive. I joined Uber at a good time. The company mostly did well and went public in 2019. All of the wealth I had accumulated in stock became real money on the open market that I could sell or trade. However, I had a lot of low-basis stocks that would trigger a high capital gains bill if I sold them. When I joined Waymo in 2020, my Alphabet colleagues talked about similar problems. I found this issue unsettling. A steep drop in stock price at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic affected my portfolio. I hired a wealth manager to help me find solutions for concentration risk. They showed me products that help people of high net worth manage concentration risk. One option is depositing concentrated stock into an exchange fund where others have done the same, and receiving fund units in return. This method can diversify your portfolio while deferring capital gains taxes. It sounded like a great product, but none of my peers had heard of it. It seemed to only be available at private banks, and only for people of a certain net worth. From what I saw, the exchange funds required a lot of human operational coordination. There seemed to be little innovation in this area to improve efficiency. I saw a massive business opportunity. I wanted to make products like this more efficient and available more broadly. I resigned from Waymo in late 2021 to start my business, Cache, which I formally launched in March 2024. We're a specialized brokerage for people holding large stock positions. Our flagship product is an exchange fund that helps people diversify their portfolios. My experience at Uber gave me an understanding of how to turn an idea into a full-blown vision as a founder. I designed products at Uber that became widely adopted within the company. This took engineering work and entrepreneurial spirit. However, moving from corporate life to building a company myself involved a lot of learning on the job. There wasn't really a manual I could follow for building an exchange fund, so we had to do a lot of R&D. There were many steps involved, including working with the SEC and FINRA to get the right registrations, since the industry is highly regulated, and building the technical infrastructure for a brokerage system. I was one of the first users of my own product, and I invested a lot of my Uber stock in our exchange funds. Running a startup is very different from working at a Big Tech company. I'm probably working triple the time I was before. Being employed in Big Tech was a very comfortable life. You worked on challenging problems and got paid well to do it. While I enjoyed this, I also wanted to figure out my own path. The entrepreneurial journey has been more fulfilling. I've had to go through personal trials, such as not paying myself for the first year after leaving Waymo. Because of my financial cushion from working in Silicon Valley, the stress of this didn't really bear on me. I'd made sure I had several years of living expenses in reserve before taking the leap. Becoming an entrepreneur requires drive and conviction. It's a very hard journey, and often, market forces will be against you until they start working with you. The glamour of being a startup founder or of an exit is the wrong reason for forming a company. It should be about self-fulfillment and a passion for building something from scratch and making a change in the world. Do you have a story to share about leaving Big Tech?

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement These go-to Alexa commands save time, simplify tasks, and make daily life easier. If you have the latest Echo Dot with Clock, you can start using these voice commands today. Alexa has come a long way since its early days as a basic voice assistant. What once felt like a novelty for playing music or checking the weather is now a powerful tool for managing your entire home. With the launch of Alexa Plus and its new AI-powered features, Amazon's voice assistant is smarter and more capable than ever before. From organizing your schedule to controlling smart devices, Alexa can help simplify your daily routine and bring a new level of convenience to your space. Whether you want to automate chores, manage your Fire TV, or just streamline your mornings, these advanced voice commands make Alexa a must-have tool in any connected home. If you haven't explored what it can do lately, now is the perfect time to see how much more useful it has become. with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Bengaluru: Raymond Realty, which is scheduled to list on the stock exchanges on 1 July, is looking at faster growth through higher home sales and several project launches in 2025-26, said a top company executive. The real estate firm was demerged from Raymond Ltd on 1 May and will list as a standalone entity. Mumbai-based Raymond Realty clocked around ₹2,300 crore of sales in FY25, and is targeting at least 20% growth this year. It also expects a 20% return on capital employed. Also read: Gautam Singhania meets European royal Prince Albert II: Here's why they met, what they discussed & more By the end of FY26, it plans to launch six projects - two in suburban Thane, where Raymond owns about 100 acres, and four projects in different locations across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) - Wadala, Sion, Mahim and Bandra. The developer currently has six projects under execution. Raymond Realty's residential portfolio, combining projects under execution and the ones to be launched, has a gross development value (GDV) of ₹40,000 crore. Of this, projects worth ₹25,000 crore GDV would be in Thane alone. The remaining projects of ₹15,000 crore GDV are in MMR. “In the next 3-4 years, we will double our sales and portfolio size. As a company, we are trying to solve for two things in the industry - quality of projects and timely delivery. We also want to focus on post delivery service, and have started our own facilities management arm," Raymond Realty chief executive Harmohan Sahni said in an interview. Also read: Centre links part of state capex loans to new reforms in land, and digitization The demerger will consolidate the group's real estate business under a single entity, which, going forward, will further unlock the firm's potential as a pure-play property development vertical. The company will sell at a broad price range of ₹20,000-65,000 per sq ft, and is not looking to sell below that, or in the uber luxury category. “We can't go lower than ₹20,000-22,000 per sq ft. We will not dilute the brand, and it is not a price-sensitive market," he added. MMR, India's most valuable property market, stands as one of the leading contributors to pan-India launches and sales.
