ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. HAWTHORNE, CALIFORNIA - MAY 2: A Tesla Model S is seen parked at a Tesla Supercharger on May 2, 2025 ... More in Hawthorne, California. (Photo by Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images) Here’s how Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) can reach $1,500, up from $300 currently. Tesla sold 1.7 million cars in 2024. The key ingredient is that Elon Musk is back in the driver’s seat, with his work at the Trump White House apparently winding down. Fully focused. Focused on the original mission: transition the world to electric vehicles and become a market leader. Ten million cars a year. Market leadership has a halo effect. We believe that momentum will provide a strong tailwind for Tesla’s next bets - humanoid robots and robotaxis as well. As an aside, market leadership is in fact one of the factors we consider in constructing the market-beating Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) - a strategy of 30 stocks that targets long-term value creation. HQ has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. We lay out our upside case for Tesla to $1,500 below, as a counterpoint to our previous analysis that outlined a downside case to $100. Separately, see Nvidia Stock At 40% Safety. So, how does this happen? First, cars. Tesla already has EV leadership. Despite the recent slowdown in EV sales in the U.S., the truth is that people want electric vehicles. Nearly 50% of cars sold in China in 2024 were EVs. This didn’t begin in China - it began in the U.S. Greta Thunberg thundered first in Europe. Then the climate message spread everywhere. People get it. Coal and gas are yesterday. Clean energy is today. The industry just needs its leader back - Musk, level-headed and championing clean energy again. The idea is simple. If China can do it, why can’t America? See Tesla’s lost cause. Once consumers in the U.S. and Europe reconnect with the urgency of the climate mission, and Musk plays a central role in it, it becomes unstoppable. Can Tesla scale to 2.5 million cars this year and 3 million in 2026? Musk has done it before, going from 500,000 to 1.8 million cars in just three years. He can do it again. On the upside, we estimate that Tesla delivers 5 million vehicles by 2027, and 10 million by 2030. At an average price of $40,000 per vehicle and a conservative 20% net margin, that’s $80 billion in profit. At a 25x multiple, that’s a $2 trillion valuation for the automotive business alone. Tesla has other major projects that could drive valuation. The robotaxi launch in Austin, expected around June, could kick off an enormous new business. To be sure, Tesla will be playing catch-up with Google's Waymo, which has offered autonomous rides in several cities for almost five years now. Can Waymo 3x Google stock? But Tesla controls the whole stack - it builds the EVs, develops the software, and also operates the charging network. It also has a large base of vehicles on the road that can be brought on board its robotaxi fleet. That’s a real edge. The ride-hailing market is already huge. Uber handled over 230 million rides per week in Q4 2024 alone. At roughly $30 per ride, that’s a $375 billion annual revenue pool. And that’s just human-driven rides. Autonomous could be bigger still. Waymo retains users better than Uber or Lyft and reports much fewer crashes than the U.S. average. Now for every person hailing a ride, ten still drive themselves. That could change quickly once people start seeing others relaxing in the back seat, watching Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel. The roughly $375 billion market could double. A $750 billion autonomous ride-hailing market isn’t far-fetched. Now, suppose Tesla captures a third of that - $250 billion in annual revenue. At a 25% net margin, that’s almost $63 billion in profit. Apply a 30x multiple, and you get $1.9 trillion in value for ride-hailing alone. Tesla is also working on humanoid robots called Optimus. The company says the robots are designed to carry out dangerous, boring, or repetitive tasks. Musk believes Optimus could eventually be Tesla’s most valuable business - and with good reason. Global labor shortages, rising wages, and soaring demand for automation all make the case for physical AI compelling. Optimus is hardly a moonshot. It’s the next logical step for a company that already builds advanced robots to manufacture its cars. And Tesla’s cars themselves are among the most sophisticated robots on wheels. Musk has said Tesla will build 10,000 Optimus units in 2025, with “several thousand” doing useful work by year-end. With a global labor force of over 3.5 billion people, even a fraction of that market could be transformative. In our upside case, Tesla might build 10 million Optimus units per year, priced at $20,000 each with 20% net margins - that’s $40 billion in annual profit. At a 30x multiple, that implies a $1.2 trillion business. Add it all up, and a $5 trillion valuation for Tesla starts to look plausible. That translates to a stock price of over $1,500 per share. What about a timeline for this? Building this sort of scale can take some time. Investors will need to look well into the future. Think 2030 or maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Tesla has the technology and scale, and is addressing a potentially massive market. With Musk back in the driver's seat, this high valuation is within reach. While Tesla is advancing transformative technologies, Trefis HQ portfolio is focused on long-term value creation. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Wells Fargo is updating its outlook on Uber (UBER), reportedly forecasting an explosive share price for the $173 billion ride-hailing company. In a new note to clients, Wells Fargo’s Ken Gawrelski and other analysts raise Uber’s price target to $100 from $90 and reiterate an overweight rating, reports Barron’s. The analysts also say Uber’s share price may rise to as high as $126, a more than 52% increase from the stock’s $82.81 close on Friday, as competition is likely to drive company efficiencies. “We believe the stock is likely to outperform as healthy fundamental trends drive upward estimate revisions.” The update comes after Uber’s reported earnings for the first quarter topped analysts’ estimates with earnings per share of $0.83, soaring above the $0.51 consensus forecast. The company also printed $11.5 billion in revenue in Q1, a 14% growth on a year-over-year basis. However, the company fell short of the anticipated revenue of $11.6 billion in the first quarter of the year. One highlight reported was that users booked more than three billion “trips,” up 18% from the first quarter of 2024. The Wells Fargo team notes that top-line trends remain strong for both Uber’s mobility and delivery segments. They also say that Uber’s deployment of autonomous vehicles in the near term should attract more investor interest.

Unlike knock-off OBD2 chips or static plug-in resistors, the Opti Fuel OBD2 Chip is engineered to communicate with your car’s ECU in real time and adapt its optimization strategies based on real-world data. The Legitimacy Checklist Here’s what separates Optifuel from questionable products: 1. Transparent Calibration Process Most ineffective fuel savers claim "instant improvement" right out of the box. Optifuel, however, clearly outlines a 150-mile learning period—a process that makes sense from a mechanical and software integration perspective. This aligns with how ECUs adapt over time to sensor data. 2. Real-Time ECU Communication Gimmick devices usually don’t interact with the car’s brain—the ECU. Optifuel does. It taps into the OBD2 diagnostic system, analyzes sensor outputs, and optimizes engine functions such as fuel-air ratios and ignition timing for better combustion. 3. Non-Invasive Operation Unlike performance tuning modules or remapping services that overwrite your ECU permanently, Optifuel works non-destructively. It makes adaptive adjustments without voiding warranties or altering factory software. This makes it a safe and reversible option for everyday drivers. 4. Consistent User Reports and Public Reviews While not every driver reports dramatic gains, the majority of feedback includes improved MPG, better throttle response, and a smoother overall ride. These testimonials consistently cite ease of use and the legitimacy of the product’s function. Addressing the Skeptics Understandably, some buyers are wary due to bad experiences with similar-looking devices. It's worth noting that Optifuel’s design and functionality are often imitated by unverified sellers. Purchasing from the official Optifuel website is essential to ensure product authenticity, access to warranty coverage, and customer support. Disclaimer: Do not purchase from unauthorized resellers. Counterfeit or cloned products may not function as described, and results cannot be guaranteed outside of official purchases. What Experts Say About Adaptive OBD2 Chips Automotive engineers and diagnostics specialists generally agree on one thing: if an OBD2 chip is going to work, it must interact with your ECU and gather ongoing data to adjust fuel parameters. Static chips without this capability are unlikely to produce any measurable results. Optifuel aligns with this recommendation by focusing on adaptive logic, real-time tuning, and driver-specific performance mapping. It’s not a racing chip or horsepower booster—it’s a smart fuel-saving device that works with your car, not against it.

The Optifuel Fuel Saver is a compact, plug-and-play OBD2 chip that connects to your vehicle’s diagnostic port to help optimize fuel efficiency and enhance car engine performance. It analyzes real-time driving behavior over a 150-mile learning phase, then adjusts fuel-air ratios, ignition timing, and throttle response to help reduce fuel waste and improve overall performance. Is the Opti Fuel OBD2 Chip compatible with my car? Yes, the Opti Fuel OBD2 Chip is compatible with most gasoline-powered vehicles manufactured in or after 1996. These vehicles are equipped with standardized OBD2 ports, which are required for the chip to function. The device is not compatible with diesel engines, electric vehicles, or hybrid models. Will the Optifuel Fuel Saver damage my car or ECU? No. The Optifuel Fuel Saver is a non-invasive fuel-saving device. It does not alter or overwrite your car’s ECU firmware or factory settings. Once removed, the vehicle’s performance reverts to its baseline operation. The chip simply enhances performance through adaptive tuning based on existing manufacturer standards. How soon will I see results? Most drivers notice improvements in miles per gallon (MPG) and smoother performance after the initial 150-mile calibration period. Some users report early results within the first few days, while others see gradual improvement over several weeks, depending on their driving habits, vehicle condition, and environment. Can using Optifuel void my car’s warranty? No, the Optifuel Fuel Saver does not void warranties. Because it does not perform permanent reprogramming or physical modifications, it complies with the manufacturer's terms for plug-in diagnostic tools. It’s a safe, compliant solution for boosting fuel economy without affecting your service agreement. Does the Optifuel chip really improve fuel efficiency? While results vary, many verified users report significant improvements in fuel efficiency, often up to 15% to35%, depending on driving behavior and vehicle health. By recalibrating fuel maps and optimizing combustion, the chip targets areas where traditional vehicles typically waste fuel. Disclaimer: Results may vary.

No tools or expertise are required. The Optifuel Fuel Saver is truly plug-and-play. You simply locate your car’s OBD2 port (typically under the dashboard), insert the device, and drive. It automatically begins learning and optimizing during your normal driving routines. Is it a performance tuner or a racing chip? No. The Optifuel chip is not designed to increase horsepower or modify vehicle speed. It’s a fuel-saving chip that focuses on smart driving optimization, cleaner combustion, and improved fuel economy. It is not a racing or performance-enhancing device. Is it safe to use long-term? Yes, the chip is safe for ongoing use. It does not store personal data, interfere with onboard electronics, or create a risk of long-term engine damage. You can keep it plugged in for continuous adaptive optimization or remove it at any time without consequence. What if I’m not satisfied with the product?

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Remember last week when Aurora met a major milestone — just squeaking by under its own deadline — and launched a driverless self-driving truck service? Welp, this week Aurora made headlines again, but for a surprising change in leadership. Co-founder Sterling Anderson, who has been chief product officer, is resigning from his position and the board. No real word on what prompted his resignation, beyond some comments he made during the company’s Q1 earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time.” He didn’t say exactly where he was going, either, except that it will be an “exciting external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company.” I’ll let you all place your bets. Aurora is pressing on without Anderson. The company announced during its earnings call that it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind by the second half of 2025. The company also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix. Got a tip for us?

Or check out these instructions to learn how to contact us via encrypted messaging apps or SecureDrop. It’s not every day a public company reverses course and goes private. But then again, these aren’t normal times. Especially for any company caught up in the U.S.-China trade war. Take Zeekr, for instance. One year ago, the Chinese EV company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, parent company Geely Auto wants to take Zeekr private in response to the Trump administration’s idea to kick Chinese companies off American stock exchanges. Other deals that got my attention … Bosch Ventures has a new $270 million fund that will continue its tradition of investing in deep tech startups. Managing director Ingo Ramesohl told TechCrunch the plan is to put more of its money into North American startups. Investors who previously backed Indian Uber rival BluSmart have proposed a plan to inject another $30 million into the struggling cab-hailing startup, which abruptly halted operations last month. But there’s a catch. Breathe, a battery software startup, raised $21 million in a Series B round led by Kinnevik Online AB, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lowercarbon Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund participated. DoorDash announced two major acquisitions as it expands into Europe. The company agreed to buy its U.K. rival Deliveroo for about £2.9 billion (around $3.87 billion) and separately said it is buying SevenRooms — which provides CRM, marketing, and operations software to help restaurants, hotels, and public venues with reservations and guest management — for $1.2 billion in cash. Meanwhile, Uber was busy this week, acquiring companies and investing in them. Uber increased its investment into Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide by $100 million as part of an expanded partnership deal to bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. In a separate deal, Uber also acquired an 85% controlling stake in Trendyol Go, the online meal and grocery delivery business based in Istanbul, for about $700 million in cash. Here’s a personnel switch I didn’t expect. Mo Elshenawy, the former president and CTO of now-shuttered self-driving car company Cruise, was just named the chief technology officer at telehealth and wellness company Hims & Hers. I spoke to Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum, and he said he specifically focused on the AV industry to find the next CTO. Here’s why. Nuro has started testing its AV tech on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently sat down with co-founder and president Dave Ferguson. Stay tuned for an update on why the company shifted its business model. Tesla‘s “Robotaxi” and “Cybercab” trademarks have hit a few roadblocks. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied Tesla’s attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” in reference to its vehicles because it’s too generic. Meanwhile, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” were halted because of companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks. Uber locked up partnerships with three Chinese autonomous vehicle companies — Pony AI, Momenta, and WeRide — in a bid to gobble up robotaxi market share in the Middle East and Europe. Footnote: These deals are not to operate in China. Waymo announced it has a new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa through a deal with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. That obviously got a lot of attention. But I was most interested in finally learning the size of Waymo’s existing commercial fleet, which is now 1,500. Wayve is making the rounds on the high-profile executive set. You might remember the video of Bill Gates in one of Wayve’s autonomous test vehicles. Now it’s Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson’s turn. P.S. Branson is a Wayve investor. BTW, Fortune Brainstorm held its AI conference in London, and Wayve CEO and co-founder Alex Kendall was there. He had some interesting comments about the company’s end-to-end approach and Tesla’s Elon Musk. Zoox paused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued a voluntary recall of its software following a crash in Las Vegas. The Cadillac Celestiq EV — yep, that monster — is here, and contributor Emme Hall has thoughts after spending a day behind the wheel. It’s earnings season, and the U.S.-China trade war is starting to leave a scratch on the paint of automakers everywhere. And, well, I don’t think we’ll be able to buff it out. Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile, Rivian said it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year (40,000 to 46,000 EVs) than previously forecasted due to tariffs and other regulatory changes. Reminder: The company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. There was some good news for Rivian, though: It generated gross profit (yeah I know, gross profit isn’t exactly my fave, either). But this met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker. Ford is raising the price of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV and the Maverick pickup by as much as $2,000 due to the import taxes Trump is placing on vehicles made in Mexico. Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric Gravity SUV. Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with Foxconn to source an electric car model the Japanese automaker plans to sell in Australia and New Zealand in the latter half of 2026. Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite an April EV sales swell. Joby Aviation seems to be settling on 2026 for its first commercial passenger service, according to its first-quarter earnings report. The electric vertical takeoff and landing startup-turned-SPAC was targeting 2025, then was stating “early 2026.” Now it’s just 2026, which suggests it might not be early next year.

Title: AI engines are starting to challenge Google's search dominance

Happy almost Friday! Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer. In today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance. If you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo, what are you waiting for? What's on deck Markets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK. Tech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else. Business: People are fed up with companies' 'bait and switch pricing.' But first, can you Google ChatGPT this? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. AI giveth, and AI taketh. Google seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels. Apple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Cue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future. Google investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday. Cue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world. (Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.) The AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great, but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews. But as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable. It's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution. A very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up, writes BI's Matthew Fox. The company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion. IBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew. (If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo. Alistair Barr will be running the show, and he does a much better job of covering tech than me.) 1. Trump's first post-tariffs trade deal. The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been "continuing at pace" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday. 2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy. 3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed. His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture. 1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards, with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced. 2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content. 3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million. 1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway. 2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging, US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi. 3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using "bait-and-switch" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway. Paramount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Powered by Adelaide, Forbes AI GUANGZHOU, CHINA - APRIL 30: Passengers have their body temperature measured before taking a WeRide ... More L4 autonomous driving bus on April 30, 2022 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China. Passengers can experience the driverless bus line in Guangzhou, which opens for a test ride from Saturday. (Photo by Chen Jimin/China News Service via Getty Images) Updated, May 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include information from Uber's Q1 2025 earnings report. Shares in WeRide, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology provider, popped 40% Tuesday, according to Google Finance. Why? The $2.6 billion market capitalization company is partnering with Uber — which is adding $100 million to its investment in WeRide — to expand its robotaxi services from Abu Dhabi to 15 more cities worldwide by 2030, according to CnEV Post. Should investors buy WeRide stock? Although the company’s revenue fell in 2024 and its losses are huge, Uber’s vote of confidence in WeRide could contribute to significant growth and ultimate profitability. WeRide — which operates a driverless commercial Robotaxi service in Beijing and does business in 10 countries — suffered a decline in revenue and a substantial loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call transcript. More specifically, in the fourth quarter WeRide’s revenue fell 3% to $15.8 million coupled with a 112% increase in the company’s net loss to $34 million, noted the earnings call transcript. WeRide has the potential to grow rapidly — with positive contribution margins — aided by local partnerships. Outside China, the company provides “autonomous vehicles and services to local partners and global platforms through a combination of selling the vehicles, charging a fixed service fee, and a revenue-sharing arrangement,” WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li told investors in the earnings call. To be sure, WeRide faces challenges when it introduces autonomous vehicles in a new location. To overcome those challenges, WeRide builds up mutual trust — gradually introducing “automobile driving products, like we can always introduce RoboSweeper at first, and also fixed-route minibus, which the challenges for safety for this product relatively low compared to the requirements for Robotaxi,” WeRide CEO Tony Han told investors, according to the earnings call. This trust has scaled sufficiently for Uber to expand its partnership with WeRide. By 2030, Uber — which already operates a robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, with Dubai next in line — will roll out WeRide’s Robotaxi services in “15 new cities across Europe and other regions outside of China and the U.S.,” noted TipRanks. The Uber-WeRide partnership splits up the work of operating robotaxis between the two companies based on their mutual strengths. WeRide provides the self-driving technology, while Uber integrates the service into its app and manages fleet operations, TipRanks reported. WeRide offers another advantages to Uber’s efforts to expand autonomous services globally. That’s because WeRide’s presence in 30 cities across 10 countries includes “test licenses in China, UAE, Singapore, France, and the U.S.,” TipRanks reported, which will make it easier for Uber to overcome regulatory barriers to entry in key markets. Uber has other robotaxi partnerships with Waymo, Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and the autonomous trucking company Aurora in the U.S. as well as international partnerships with Pony.AI and Momenta, reported CNBC. Besides its Waymo partnership, Uber has also agreed to work with Volkswagen, Avride, May Mobility, and for autonomous ride-hailing and freight services in the U.S. Uber has additional partnerships with AV companies internationally including with WeRide, Pony.AI and Momenta. Based on analysts’ price targets, WeRide stock has more upside than Uber. Two analysts who cover WeRide set an average price target of $22, according to Zack’s — representing 133% upside. Meanwhile, Uber — which just reported first quarter 2025 results — has less upside. More specifically, the ride-booking giant’s stock has 5.6% upside based on the average price target of 33 analysts of $90.20, noted TipRanks. Uber’s stock fell 1.3% in May 7 trading after reporting a mixed result – in which the company’s revenue fell short of expectations while its earnings per share beat them. Specifically, Uber’s Q1 revenue of $11.53 billion fell $100 million short of London Stock Exchange Group expectations, according to CNBC, while Q1 earnings per share of 80 cents beat analysts’ views by 33 cents. The company’s Waymo Austin launch “exceeded” Uber’s expectations and around 100 Waymo vehicles operating in Austin are now‬‭ “busier than over 99% of all drivers” in Austin as measured by the number completed trips per day, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC. With the global market for robotaxi services growing at an 80.8% average annual rate to $119 billion by 2031, according to Fortune Business Insights, WeRide stock may have further room to rise with help from the Uber partnership.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File photo Uber Technologies missed quarterly revenue estimates as growth in its ride-hailing unit slowed to its weakest since the pandemic, stirring fears of slowing demand against the backdrop of a murky economic outlook and clouding an upbeat forecast. Shares of the company fell about 8 per cent before clawing back some ground to be down 5 per cent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Total revenue rose 14 per cent to $11.53 billion in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $11.62 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Uber has struggled to match the high growth from the post-pandemic quarters and is also contending with lower ride prices with some customers seeking cheaper transport options.
