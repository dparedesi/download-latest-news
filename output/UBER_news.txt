Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Title: Forecast 2026: In the Vortex of the Whirl

“Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others.” —Pema Chodron 2026 is the 250th anniversary of our country’s conception. A few years later when the Constitution was ratified, we became a republic — “if you can keep it,” Ben Franklin cracked to anxious citizens waiting outside the great hall in Philadelphia. Our country was predicated on the resolve of virtuous men operating under the rule of law. We are lately under an astounding siege of villains without principle seeking to wreck the republic. The big question facing the USA is whether our political life can become even more deranged than it has been in the past ten years, or can we possibly sober up. How is it we’re still arguing about men in women’s locker rooms? The self-evident has gone missing. A lot has gone very wrong. The Woke-Jacobin war against our country continues, led by a Democratic Party made even more vicious, depraved, and insane by the 2024 election victory of Mr. Trump, who was left a broken polity after the four-year tableau vivant of “Joe Biden.” Can our nation recover its balance, its sense of purpose, its traction in history? Can we reconstruct a coherent common culture that will afford us some means to carry on as an upright people? I will try to answer without wasting pixels. Hijacking the Law Nothing is more urgent than cleaning up the machinery of our elections. It is overloaded now with deliberately devious complexities that invite fraud. We must put an end to mail-in ballots with the sole exception of traditional absentee ballots for citizens out of the country on election day, with proof. We must eliminate all electronic interfaces between the vote and the tally, including all ballot-counting hardware, and return to paper ballots tallied by human beings. We must require voter ID, proof of citizenship, and proof of local voting-district residence. Automatic motor-voter registration must end. Ballots must be cast on election day only (absentee ballots must be received by election day) and the results reported out in twenty-four hours. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication.

To learn more visit: Vaulted.com It would be tiresome to rehearse exactly how our elections became rigged and degraded by orchestrated fraud. . . the mischief around the Covid-19 caper. . . the sinister techno-narcissism of machine automation. . . the marshaling of non-citizens against citizens. . . the abuse of office and authority. . . . But, understand that an industry has evolved to take full advantage of that. It’s personified by the Democratic Party-allied lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, who played a significant role in the legal expansion of mail-in voting that led up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Democracy Docket org is funded by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, associated NGOs (the Hopewell Fund, the North Fund) used as pass-throughs for the Arabella Fund, the MacArthur Foundation, and the David Rockefeller Fund. In 2021, Marc Elias founded the Elias Law Group after leaving Perkins Coie, the Washington DC power firm that played a significant role in the RussiaGate crimes centered around Hillary Clinton’s Steele Dossier. At Perkins Coie, in advance of the 2020 election, Elias was extensively involved in challenging, litigating, influencing, and re-engineering state election laws and advised on “dark money” strategies for Democratic voter “outreach” (that is, ballot-harvesting). It was all meticulously gamed-out beforehand by an NGO called the Transition Integrity Project founded by Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center. The objective: to maximize opportunities for improper balloting. After the 2020 election, Marc Elias defended the suspicious results from counties in swing states against Trump campaign lawsuits (winning 64 of 65 cases on specious grounds). The last thing Marc Elias has been interested in is election integrity. His focus is strictly on winning elections for the Democratic Party by any means necessary. The war cry about “defending democracy” is the exact opposite of what the lawfare ninjas actually do. Through 2025, Congress has entertained election reform bills, most recently, the SAVE Act (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility), which has languished on the House side for months awaiting deliberation in the Senate. Prediction: Mr. Trump will turn up the heat on Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to expedite passage of election reform. This partly depends on the dark business now occurring in Venezuela, which is the suspected hub of a global election rigging apparatus engineered around Dominion / Smartmatic technology. Prediction: Marc Elias will be indicted for activities related to election fraud. Norm Eisen is the point man for Democratic party Lawfare, which is warfare against the citizens of the USA by means of the courts. Eisen is affiliated with the Brookings Institution and the States United Democracy Center, which is supported by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation and activist orgs associated with Arabella Advisors, a hub fueled by dark money. He was an active participant in the Transition Integrity Project of 2020. Norm Eisen’s general mission for years is to drain the resources of the Democratic Party’s political opponents in frivolous lawsuits — working in partnership with Democratic activist judges — and to overburden the federal court dockets to paralyze the working-out of our nation’s disputes. Eisen was counsel to Jerrold Nadler’s 2019 House impeachment committee and was involved in the machinations of then-Rep. Adam Schiff with CIA-agent “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella, Intel IG Michael Atkinson, and NSC staffer Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, who cooked up the Ukraine phone call scheme to impeach Mr. Trump. After “Joe Biden’s” fake election, Eisen was deeply involved in choreographing the scope and format of the House Jan-6 hearings for which the Republican minority was not allowed to choose its own committee members. The committee proceedings were arranged as a prestige docudrama TV show, under the direction of former ABC network president, James Goldstein, hired, in effect, as the producer of a show. The committee destroyed its entire evidence cache after it issued its final report. That’s how much confidence they had in their methods and findings. After that exploit, Eisen acted as a facilitator and strategist for “Joe Biden’s” DOJ in the 2024 Jack Smith Special Counsel prosecutions of Donald Trump, and acted as a go-between for the DOJ in the various New York State cases against Trump and the Fulton County, GA, case brought by DA Fani Willis. All of these actions amounted to election interference — a concerted conspiracy to eliminate Mr. Trump by putting him in prison by way of specious, malicious prosecutions — and, one way or another, they all failed to accomplish their goal. Norm Eisen and Marc Elias, along with their lawfare cohorts Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Ben Wittes should be subject to prosecution under federal criminal statutes for their wide-ranging activities, including: 18 U.S.C. § 241 (Conspiracy Against Rights); 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements); 18 U.S.C. § 594 (Intimidation of Voters). The next big hairball is the politicized judiciary, federal judges who consistently interfere in executive actions (the President), a clash between Article II and Article III of the Constitution. It amounts to Democratic Party-designated plaintiffs getting injunctions and restraining orders through partisan judges against policies issued by the White House around deportation of illegal immigrants, firings of federal employees, funding freezes, the termination of “birthright citizenship,” and more. The funding freeze and firing cases were aimed at keeping taxpayer dollars flowing out federal agencies to Democratic Party NGOs and for keeping the so-called “resistance” operators in positions of influence within government agencies at their desks and on the payroll. Many of the NGOs promote activities aimed at dismantling the government and fomenting racial animus. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite that. The president must be allowed to fire employees of the executive branch engaged in slow-motion sedition. These court rulings are choreographed by Norm Eisen’s lawfare operation which has enough money from the aforementioned NGOs and billionaire-funded foundations to bring endless lawsuits in order to gum up the works of governance. The remedy for all this is knotty. The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) has reversed many lower court rulings, but these are provisional actions, pending the SCOTUS entertaining any particular case decisively in regular session. The myriad cases end up jamming the SCOTUS docket. The net effect is to slow down policy that President Trump was elected to pursue. Federal judges can otherwise be removed only via impeachment by the US Senate, which is a practical impossibility at this time since it requires 60 out of 100 votes and the Republicans hold a mere 53 seat majority out of 100. Perhaps the best remedy is to prosecute the lawfare ninjas who are ginning up all those court cases. Their activities can be framed as a conspiracy against rights (18 U.S.C. § 241). Against whose rights? Against the rights of the people of the US to an executive that is able to discharge its Constitutional duties — to provide for the public safety, to enforce the law, and to carry out foreign policy. Norm Eisen, Marty McCord, and Andrew Weissmann might also be subject to a charge of seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 2384), as when two or more persons conspire to “levy war against the United States. And it is warfare using the mechanisms of the law. Norm Eisen is behaving like a spike protein in the nation’s bloodstream, turning the nation’s immune system, the rule of law, against the nation. Prediction: Norm Eisen and cohorts will be hiring criminal defense lawyers in 2026. Hijacking the Truth “. . . the dirty little secret is that the same people pretending to be fighting fascism are the fascists.” —Sasha Stone The American people have been increasingly subjected to a contrived permission structure that has normalized lying and deceit about everything and anything, leaving every major institution in the land damaged or wrecked. Lying has become the default position of many in authority, and no one has been held accountable for it. Medicine is wrecked due to the dishonest behavior of doctors colluding with the pharmaceutical industry and officials of the Health and Human Services agencies on the Covid-19 op — mandates, lockdowns, lying about efficacy and harms, hiding true remedies, cover-up of the origins of Covid — as well as the medical establishment’s regular ongoing “health care” racketeering operations in concert with insurance companies, hospital conglomerates, and other players. The cruelty and incompetence of these medical rackets is one thing, but the moral failure is spectacular. Medicine has forsaken the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. The many agencies under US HHS, plus the university labs, the medical journals, the state medical boards, and the mainstream media’s health reporters are all implicated in these ongoing misdeeds. Until late in 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr., was sore beset by “resistance” at the FDA, CDC, NIH, and everything else under the giant agency’s umbrella. In December, 2025, things are changing. The CDC’s ACIP vaccine advisory committee stopped recommending Hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. Then the CDC officially acknowledged that COVID-19 vaccines have caused injuries in adults, previously stonewalled. These might be signs that Mr. Kennedy is finally getting a grip on his sprawling agencies. Prediction: in 2026, expect criminal referrals against former senior management at CDC, FDA, and NIH for a range of crimes in the Covid-19 operation. In the larger picture, the whole scaffold of health care is in the process of imploding. Predictions: In 2026, doctors will increasingly bail out of big corporate practices and go freelance on a cash payment basis, leaving behind the corrupt and onerous insurance racket. Hospitals will shutter. Giant medical insurance conglomerates will go out of business. Millions will be left without coverage. Medicine will be forced to begin reorganizing on an emergent, provisional basis. The net effect will be doctors who make less money but control their own medical practices and much more limited access to specialty medicine for the general public, including now-common surgeries like joint replacement and cancer therapies. It will be most difficult for doctors to regain their authority and the esteem of their patients. Alt medical practitioners of every sort will multiply, many on the down-low evading regulation, as sick citizens desperately seek relief from illness while they navigate around the ruins of the old standard medicine. Quackery will flourish and it will be difficult for ordinary people to discern which health care services are of value and which are scams. Higher education is obviously ill. It bargained away its legitimacy by participating in the college loan racket with the equally deleterious overlay of pervasive DEI racketeering (and inevitable lowering of standards). That opened the door for grievance-oriented Marxists, and race-and-gender hustlers to take the curricula hostage — wholesale intellectual racketeering. That, in turn, led to the abolition of truth-telling for the purpose of advancing agendas. Reality on campus became purely transactional and contingent. Free speech was suppressed. All of this was supported by pusillanimous college deans and cowardly university presidents and now they are paying the price. Too many young Americans do not believe that a college degree has value, especially at the price of six-figures in debt. Most colleges and universities are not backstopped by big endowments like the big Ivy League schools and a lot of them will be going out of business in 2026. Graduate schools and PhD programs will be especially hard hit. It’s not clear what role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in paring down the numbers of candidates for certified expertise, but it’s not looking good. Any earnest young person can already find an adequate education post-secondary education on the internet, for instance the Khan Academy, a long-running, pre-AI, free website of courses from the rudimentary to the advanced. The arts and the cultural media (including news media) have been disgracing themselves frantically for years. Film production in Los Angeles dropped 63-percent in 2024 extending into 2025. The feature film is being replaced by short-format Instagram and Tiktok videos. The multiplex cinemas are empty. The theatrical exhibition of movies is on its deathbed. They can’t compete with giant flat-screens in the comfort of your home where microwaved popcorn is only a buck a bowl (compared to $32 at the cineplex.) Management of the Hollywood studios was taken hostage by race-and-gender hustlers, with permission structures engineered by financial reliance on Chinese (CCP-affiliated) investors and distributors. The result was Woke cinema, girl-boss movies, DEI-oriented storytelling, and one flop after another. The replication of streaming channels has only invoked Gresham’s Law in culture: bad content drives out good content. The next development, moving very rapidly now, is AI applied to cinema, which implies the end of the acting profession at least, and perhaps screenwriting, too. The end product is liable to be something more like an hallucination than a story told in the language of dramaturgy, following the logic of authentic human behavior. I’d expect even more corrosive effects of Gresham’s Law in the new AI regime as genuine human creativity becomes ever more mediated and abstracted from the end product. You must also wonder about the long-term prospects of the Internet as we know it. The sheer stress on the electric grid from the demands of AI suggests problems with reliable electric service in the years ahead. The whole thing begins to look like a self-limiting problem. Ten years from now, we might be back to entertaining ourselves with puppet shows. News as we knew it for much of the past 200 years is also gone missing. The remnants exist on cable channels and internet sites as a commerce in gossip, rumor, and opinion. The legacy TV news channels no longer employ reporters in the field. Even under Bari Weiss’s new management, CBS’s 60-Minutes still broadcasts rafts of mendacious propaganda each week. “X,” formerly Twitter, is a colossal grape-vine, and is now touting itself as the world’s leading news source, though it still engages in surreptitious censorship. These days, you must be your own gatekeeper (managing editor), combing through bales of crap to find the scattered gems of real news. The authoritative, trustworthy editors of yore are no more. Hardly anyone in the public arena speaks with authority, and reputations are easily assassinated by interested parties with agendas. The newspapers have made themselves pathetic jokes — The New York Times with its Pulitzer Prize for lying about RussiaGate and routine spin services for the corrupt Democratic Party. . . The Washington Post acting as publicist for nefarious cabals in and around the intel blob. Local newspapers lie dead everywhere, and hardly anyone knows what is going on in their own towns. The people are horrifically misinformed and uninformed. Don’t expect AI to make the situation any better. The years ahead may therefore be a nadir of public confusion, delusion, and generalized ignorance in societies whose complexity cannot survive such derangements. What was not so many decades ago a high trust society based on a coherent common culture and broadly agreed-upon values seems to be devolving into babel and anarchy leading eventually to a generalized social collapse. Out of that, a new consensus about reality will emergently and eventually self-organize, but it’s impossible to say how long that might take, what degree of disorder will have to be endured on the journey to resolution, and what the reorganized template for human behavior might finally look like. Humans organized in societies need the truth. They need trustworthy authorities. Authority without truth is just cruel, faithless power. The Democratic Party in our time has given you a nice demonstration of how that works. The party deserves to be put out of business. Perhaps that will begin the process of reconstructing a coherent common culture. War is Politics by Other Means “The self-described Coalition of the Willing was always little more than a public relations exercise. Today – after almost four years of bloody fighting – it is evident that the main concern of this Coalition is to limit the damage caused by its posturing.” —Frank Furedi Interested parties in the USA and the NATO deliberately started the Ukraine War in 2014 while transforming that sad-sack nation into a global money laundry. The reasons appear to have been nefarious and reckless. By Christmas 2025, Mr. Trump’s attempts to negotiate a peace had not succeeded. Even now, the big dogs of NATO make noises and idle threats about going to war with Russia. The rationale for that is preposterous, since they lack the military manpower and the armaments to prosecute such a war, and open themselves to nuclear destruction if they even attempt such a folly. The USA, at this point, has no vested interest in Ukraine. It is in everybody’s interest that the Ukraine revert to its pre-2014 condition as an uncontested frontier nation within Russia’s sphere of influence that does not make itself a pain-in-the-ass for the lands adjacent and proximate to it. It is very much in the USA’s interest to develop respectful, transactional relations with Russia a nation which, paradoxically, under Vladimir Putin, is making itself a last bastion of Western Civ while the EU nations commit economic and cultural suicide, make war on their own citizens, and beat a path to some grim, neo-medieval future. At this moment, there are three plausible endings to the Ukraine War. One is a simple armistice, a cessation of military operations, but without any formal peace settlement. That would look like the long and contentious irresolution of the Korean War, a suspended animation of hostilities at the current battle lines. A second potential outcome is a straight-up Russian victory, leaving Russia to pick up the pieces of what will be a failed state, will require Russia to take administrative control and rebuild what can be afforded, perhaps with international help, or not, and to see if Ukraine can stand on its feet as a sovereign state — understood to not be subject to outside manipulation. That is apt to be the outcome when money and arms from the West stop flowing into Ukraine, which is about exactly where things stand on New Year’s 2026. Mr. Trump appears to want out of supporting a war that Ukraine is clearly losing at this point. The EU’s option of underwriting the Ukraine war machine by confiscating Russian financial assets trapped in Europe’s banks was eight-sixed by Hungary and Belgium just after Christmas. Confiscating Russia’s sovereign wealth would have probably destroyed Europe’s bond markets and blown up the entire financial system of Western Civ. Europe’s economies are in enough trouble as it is, with industry failing, energy resources getting scarcer and less affordable, and social welfare systems under a mighty strain — not to mention the demographic fiasco of falling indigenous birthrates and the ongoing invasion of so many migrants from the global south. The third possible outcome of the Ukraine mess is that the Ukrainian people themselves will opt out of the war by getting rid of the Zelenskyy regime. Zelenskyy is already engulfed in a scandal over all the money that he and his cronies creamed off out of US and NATO financial support. Also, Ukraine has lost 10-million in population since the start of hostilities in 2022, more than a million of them soldiers killed in action. The lack of young men on the scene is an economic and demographic disaster. The Ukrainians know that Zelenskyy is a criminal as well as an incompetent war commander. They are sick of war, of carnage, of wreckage and ruin. Forecast: Zelenskyy will be ousted as president by elite Ukrainian military units before the four-year anniversary of the war’s onset in February. Ukraine then concedes the loss of its territories. . .the war ends. . . and Russia supervises an election at the earliest opportunity. The world moves on. Euroland Cracks Up Europe’s days as a tourist theme park draw to a close. A new era dawns: the Neo-medieval. The ancient competition for power and resources between language groups and geographic regions heats up again, with even fewer goodies to fight over this time around. EU-style cooperation breaks down. The Big Dogs (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) can no longer stand the grotesque over-regulation of their businesses and their energy needs. They withdraw from the EU and the union dissolves in a matter of weeks. Hard borders are reinstated. Old currencies reappear: the franc, the mark, the guilder, lira. Diplomats make frantic rounds to renegotiate trade agreements and financial arrangements, including how to deal with the many failed European banks and the broken bond markets. Skirmishes break out along contested national frontiers and the sea lanes become danger zones. Meanwhile, Europe’s people endure a severe slowdown in all business activity, loss of pensions, a broken social safety net, and a gross loss of trust in the political class. Populations grow restive. Indigenous Brits, Frenchmen, Germans, finally express their pent-up resentment with third world migrants and a movement grows to expel as many as possible back to their nations of origin. That sparks a violent response from the migrants, especially the jihad-inclined Islamists. It blossoms into medium-grade urban warfare. Militaries are called in to clean out the migrant ghettos and deport non-citizens. It is a high-tech Reconquista, but much more difficult than previous episodes on the continent, bloodier and less successful. In some localities, migrants gain the upper hand by sheer numbers. It could take decades to resolve this, if at all. There is even the possibility that some countires will be overtaken by Islam. The UK is a candidate for that. It has already shown abject submission, and it’s not going too far to imagine the Islamic population could attempt the extermination of native Britons. Many of their imams say as much out loud, one way or another, and the demoralized Brits do nothing about it If hostilities break out, I would not expect the USA to come to Europe’s rescue this time around. America is already showing signs of dissociating from Europe and NATO. It is in the NATO by-laws, for instance, that America is not obliged to defend countries that militate against support free speech, and there are already multiple aggressive censorship programs enacted around the continent. “X” was just fined $140-million by the European Commission for refusing to censor so-called “hate speech” — which is any sundry utterance that some low-level European bureaucrat deems offensive. Prediction: Macron, Merz, Starmer will be run out of office in the coming year one way or another. It will look a little like the year 1848 all over again, when revolt broke out all over the continent. The Marxists will be very active and aggressive, as ever, but they will ultimately lose. Nobody really wants to try communism again. The farmers, especially, have been in the vanguard of protest because of the EU’s onerous and idiotic regulatory regime. 1848 was mainly a revolt of urban industrial labor — the workers! Industry in 1848 was a pretty new thing at the grand scale. The deleterious effects on the laboring class came on quickly and had become too terrible to ignore. It reached a critical threshold before authorities were prepared for it. The next revolution will resolve initially into systems collapse, deep economic contraction, and continued population decline. Generalized, intractable hardship will become the new normal in Europe. Large nation states might de-consolidate, fracture into smaller autonomous regions, to keep public affairs manageable. Some regions may just get chaotic, and stay that way for a long time. Germany has only been a nation since 1871, prior to which it was a crazy-quilt of kingdoms, grand duchies, principalities, and free cities (e.g., Bremen, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Hamburg). The spectacular failure of liberal democracy in our time could easily usher in a period of autocracy — managers who can expedite problem-solving without the intercession of parliaments — and that might even mean a return to monarchy that actually rules. We thought that humanity had moved beyond that, but history is a prankster. Anyway, the USA will increasingly be an observer of all this from our remove across the Atlantic. For now, we are preoccupied with our own backyard. Return of the Monroe Doctrine A friend writes: “Trump has made the wise (and unavoidable) decision to recognize that we don’t and can’t rule the world, but we can be secure in the Western Hemisphere.” Already, under Mr. Trump, US foreign policy is recalibrating to clean up our own hemisphere — to make things a lot harder for China to surreptitiously colonize South America as a resource depot, to smash the drug cartels that are killing off Americans, bust the mafia-like governments associated with them, and aggressively discourage communist movements where they crop up. The obvious case-in-point just now is Venezuela and its long-running Chavez-to-Maduro regime, accused of hosting CCP operations, meddling in elections via internet fuckery in every place it can install Dominion / Smartmatic machines, offering a platform for Iran to antagonize the USA, expropriating US oil leases, and working hand-in-hand with Cuba’s intel services, Brazil’s Lula da Silva, and Mexico’s drug cartels to wage a new generation of warfare against the USA. Mr. Trump is going after Venezuela hard now. Don’t know how he’s going to bust up the place, exactly, but it’s coming, perhaps even without a whole lot of kinetic action. Prediction: a new government and new rules for Venezuela in 2026. US oil companies come back in and get the stuff back pumping. Venezuela gets the licensing fees, royalties, all above-board. Rule of law returns, including property law. Venezuelans can open businesses again. They send us major league baseball players instead of Tren de Agua gangsters and fentanyl. As a side effect of choking-off Venezuela, Cuba’s communist regime finally falls, too. They have depended utterly on Maduro’s oil and with the tankers blockaded, the island will soon go dark. The Castro brothers are gone. Communism, can no longer rely on their charisma. The current president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, is a nonentity. He will be overthrown in 2026, and for the first time in nearly 70 years, Cuba will be a free society. The election of Javier Milei in Argentina has turned that country back in the direction of economic liberty by severely paring down the size of parasitical government and all the racketeering associated with it that has dragged Argentina down since rise of Juan Peron and Peronism after World War Two. In October 2025, the Trump admin offered to help stabilize Argentina’s currency with a $20-billion currency swap line, conditioned on Milei’s ongoing free market reforms. His reforms will continue in 2026, lifting Argentina yet closer to its former status as one of the world’s richer nations. On December 14, 2025, Chile elected a conservative, Jose Antonio Kast, replacing the leftist government of Gabriel Boric. Kast’s election victory, with a 58-percent margin in the runoff against leftist candidate Jeannette Jara. This was a sharp rejection of Boric’s leftist administration, driven by crime, immigration, and economic dysfunction, leading to a significant rightward shift in Chilean politics. Kast’s victory aligns with a regional trend toward right-leaning leaders in Latin America, emphasizing security and migration controls. President Lula of Brazil represents an ongoing irritant to the USA. With Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, plus the Castro brothers, Lula organized the São Paulo Forum (Foro de São Paulo), a coordination platform for leftist political parties, movements, and organizations. You probably noticed that Lula’s 2020 election showed similar earmarks of fraud as “Joe Biden’s” election in the USA. Unlike “Biden” versus Trump, Lula managed to jail his rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, whose party has been shattered. Prediction: Trump and Marco Rubio will work hard to neutralize the Foro de São Paulo’s operations across South America. Prediction: they will attempt to spring Bolsonaro from prison in time for the October 2026 election. Prediction: Lula will encounter strong, Trump-induced headwinds in the election. Mr. Trump is leaning hard on President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico to cease support of the drug cartels sending fentanyl into the USA. (Ha! How is that even plausible?) He’s gone as far as threatening to send American troops after the cartels’ headquarters in Mexico, and he imposed a 25-percent tariff on Mexican goods exported to the USA, but the duties were “paused” pending progress on border security and drug cooperation. At least, crossings of illegal migrants through Mexico has been reduced to near-zero on the cusp of 2026. Trump and Rubio would like to think they can work with Sheinbaum. Altogether, President Trump is reawakening interest in the America’s relations with South America after a long coma-like period of official inattention. He can already claim a substantial victory in reinstating American control over the Panama Canal with almost zero fanfare and no negative blowback. China still controls ports associated with the canal. They will probably be encouraged to sell those assets. In 2014, China broke ground symbolically for a new trans-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, estimated cost $50-billion. Since then, nothing has happened with it. The project remains suspended and no construction begun. China might be discerning that further colonialist activity in this hemisphere is a low-percentage, unwelcome move. Rampant Dragons and Rising Suns The far east is now a region of fully modernized sovereign states with high-tech armies, heavy industry, and rising prospects compared to Europe (now headed in the opposite direction), with China the biggest dog in the yard. China’s swift thirty-year lift out of something like 12th Century darkness has been an amazing spectacle, for sure. The USA is deeply intimidated by China’s manufacturing dominance, its technological prowess, and its growing military capability. There’s been plenty of loose talk about China’s “long game” aspiration to acquireNorth America as a resource depot. Sending tens of thousands of military-age men through “Joe Biden’s” open border 2021 to 2025 reinforced that worry. We still don’t know what they are up to here, what they are programmed to carry-out, and what we’re going to do about it. The news media isn’t paying attention to that for now. Many expect China to attempt some form of creeping world domination in the decades ahead. As Martin Armstrong put it (paraphrase): Cycles are a kind of religion in China, and they believe now is their turn in history. Yes, they probably think so. But I tend to view their rapid rise to world power as a self-limiting condition. We Americans know something about how quickly great techno-industrial surges can turn and go to shit. Just look around the midwestern rust-belt. The citizens of Detroit back in 1955 would be astonished at the current condition of what had been the seventh-richest city in the world then. A similar fate might await China, since it still depends so heavily on oil and natgas imports and coal-fired power plants. China also lacks the sturdy body of property law that tends to prevent hot battles over domains and the things of value built on them. For now, that authority is vested in the caprices of the CCP. But you must wonder how much possibly independent authority is lodged in the Peoples’ Liberation Army and its generals. Though the CCP has managed to remain in operation for a long time, it is not necessarily a permanent installation in the human condition. China’s population — which, by the way, is rumored to be well under the 1.4-billion claimed (estimated as low as 775-million now) — has been getting restive as the country’s industry matures and begins to show signs of similar sclerosis as seen in America. The financial condition of the country remains especially sketchy, since the CCP controls the banks and can stage-manage their outward appearances. Inside, Chinese banks are a vast chaos of janky loans based on a collateral of hopelessly crappy, fast-disintegrating high-rise apartments that China’s new middle class was swindled into buying for investment purposes, not to live in. Youth unemployment is trending at around 15-percent now. Prediction: expect more social unrest in China, with a destabilizing effect on the CCP’s ability to control events. The world’s attention tends to be focused on the fate of Taiwan, the island nation that was under direct Chinese mainland rule from 1683 to 1895, after which it was briefly swapped to Japan, who lost it in World War Two. In 1949, Chinese nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to the island from Mao Zedong’s communists. It has evolved into a stable democratic republic and a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse. The USA is addicted to Taiwan’s computer chips, but then we are addicted to scores of products and resources from mainland still-communist China, too. It appears that the Trump admin is trying to wriggle out of that dilemma by re-industrializing the USA. Prediction: China, has been playing the long game as usual, and will keep hands-off Taiwan in 2026, while continuing to signal its control over whatever comes in and goes out of the island. China does not want to commit to a financially ruinous war over Taiwan at this moment of financial instability on the mainland. Prediction: The long game doesn’t pan out. This will be Xi Jinping’s last year as leader of China. Economic turmoil will prompt the CCP to replace him, and serial replacements won’t last. China slips and drifts as no one can consolidate power. India slips and drifts too, unable to overcome its predicament of reliance on imported oil and foreign investment. Prediction: Narendra Modi loses his grip on power. India’s economy falters and the subcontinent begins to fracture into regions. All major nations of Southeast Asia struggle to stay afloat on the cheap labor manufacturing boom largely pegged to a wobbling global economy with the US as consumer of the first-and-last resort. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia will all come under a strain in 2026 as their factories idle. Radical groups begin to rise and challenge established power bases. Things go sideways. Global Jihad They’re not subtle about it. Islamic Jihad advertises itself loudly at the local grass-roots level. Imams in the UK, France, Germany, Dearborn (MI), all proclaim that the places they have migrated to will become Muslim-dominated. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani says he believes in global jihad. For mysterious reasons, this seems to tickle the uber-woke liberals of the Upper West Side who voted for Mamdani. The Jihadis shout about the death of America, the death of Western Civ, the death of all who are not Islamists. It’s woven into the Muslim theology. Muslims who kill “infidels” get super brownie-points in the permission structure of Islam. The west has rolled over for this malevolent nonsense for some years now, and it is all coming to a head in 2026. Prediction: EU nations and the UK will begin deporting recent illegal migrants back to where they came from, starting slowly and accelerating as resistance and violence by the designated deportees (and their allies) make it ever clearer that it is an existential necessity to get them out — and beef up their coastline protections so that new migrants cannot enter. Mostly freelance non-state Jihadis will attempt bloody operations against the property and interests of the deporting nations. They will bomb and massacre inside EU countries (likely here in America, too), and outside America against embassies and corporate property. Prediction: The mass deportations will mark a major turnaround in the West, and will be accompanied by changes in government, including the dissolution of the EU bureaucracy itself. Brussells, Belgium, the EU headquarters city, with a large Muslim population, will be a violent hot-spot. Islamism will begin to be turned back. Street protests only just erupted in Iran after Christmas, and are reaching impressive levels quickly. It’s too early to say where it is going. New Year’s Day, businesses, schools, and government offices were shut down — but, the holiday and all. Growing severe water shortages might be behind the unrest as much as dissatisfaction with decades of mullah rule. Trump and the US Domestic Scene At holiday time late in 2025, after nearly a year of exhilarating and tumultuous Trump 2.0 activity, a dark cloud swept over MAGA and many Trump supporters started gobbling up black pills and getting super-depressed. The assassination of Charlie Kirk tripped a lot of that off. It was a significant event. In a nation where reality is now optional for many groups and individuals, every niche of uncertainty and doubt gets filled with narrative battles that harden fear and paranoia. Oddly, with so much of the Woke Left pimping for Hamas the past two years against Israel, elements of the MAGA Right picked up that gonfalon and ran with it, too — led by podcasters Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, and Tucker Carlson. Candace put out the idea that Israel killed Charlie, and many others just twanged against Israel on the general principle that Israel showers too much money on congressmen and senators — and that the executive branch is too cozy with the Jewish state — and, of course, Gaza (“Genocide.”) So now, you have both the Wokesters and part of MAGA hatin’ on Israel. A lot of this heat was probably generated by the RINO / NeverTrumper branch of the Republican Party seeking to wrassle back its hegemony over the party’s electoral apparatus from Trump / MAGA forces. Ron DeSantis is the RINO / NeverTrumper stalking horse, with that gang setting-up a potential switcheroo for JD Vance’s expected run in 2028. The bottom line, as advanced by the inimitable “Sundance” writing at The Last Refuge blogspot is that the RINO / NeverTrumper gang actually wants to lose the 2026 midterms so that Mr. Trump will be hamstrung for the remainder of his term. Prediction: MAGA has strategic and tactical capabilities that shouldn’t be underestimated. They will fight hard against their in-party enemies moving through the coming year and the fight will reveal the bad intentions of their enemies. Meanwhile, on the other front, the Trump admin is working hard to sever the NGO revenue lines that support the Democratic Party’s shock troops, Antifa, what remains of BLM, the lawfare ninjas, the From-the-River-to-the-Sea crowd, and assorted cadres of the mentally ill. The DOJ, along with its subsidiary, the FBI, is preparing to go medieval on these groups. AAG Harmeet Dhillon is turning the mojo of her Civil Rights division against anarchists who operated freely under “Joe Biden” — and they will liberally use the “domestic terrorist” tag to make this happen. AAG Dhillon is also keeping pressure on the colleges and universities that permitted Jihad on-campus and will take the federal funding away from the grownups who run these joints — who stand by and do nothing in the face of violence and intimidation. Prediction: Anti-Israel activism has gone as far as it can go and will start tailing off now as Israel’s operations in Gaza rachet down. Hamas is defeated. That’s a plain fact. It’s over over there. The surviving Palestinians will be living under a protectorate that requires them to give up devoting themselves to terror. As averred to previously, Jihad will not be greeted favorably in the USA, whether in Mamdani’s New York City or Ilhan Omar’s Minneapolis. MAGA will screw its head back on and re-focus on our country’s priorities: rebuilding productive infrastructure, carefully dismantling rogue financialization like the colossal IED it is, rescuing the American family from Woke depradations, making the people healthy again, reestablishing a coherent consensus on culture, values, right-and-wrong, and getting violence out of public life. The biggest head-wind that Trump faces, of course, is a sociopathic Democratic Party that will do anything to return to power and resume its racketeering operations. Prediction: In 2026, many of their point-persons, past-and-present, will be headed into a courtroom, possibly to a guilty verdict for conspiracy to overthrow the government and other serious charges, such as election fraud. “Joe Biden’s” blanket pardons will be declared illegitimate by SCOTUS due to the profligate use of the autopen by “JB’s” reckless subordinates (some of whom will also land in court). Higher-ups in the health agencies who took part in the Covid-19 operation will also find themselves in legal jeopardy, including the Covid Pimpernel himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, if he remains alive. Some military figures such as general Milley will face charges. Nothing less than a comprehensive cleanup will do. If Mr. Trump lets the seditions continue, he’ll be buffaloed for the next three years just like the first time around. It’s possible that he will have to invoke a national emergency in order to overcome the resistance of the lawfare federal judge coterie. And I would not feel too sanguine about the members of Nancy Pelosi’s J-6 House Committee, or Ms. Pelosi herself in connection with the FBI / Democratic Party J-6 fake insurrection prank at the Capitol itself. Justice is coming before the 2026 midterms. Finance and Economy Mr. Trump’s biggest headwind is the ever-jankier finance sector of the US economy, a horrific, mold-like overgrowth that has sickened the country with hyper-complex trickery around debt and capital. Too many faithless promises have been made to pay back debts that will never be paid back. And too much wealth has migrated into a few elite hands on the back of those false promises. Too much collateral is mispriced and over-priced, and the re-pricing is liable to be rather violent. At the top are x-quadrillions of derivative positions — bets that could wreck global banking if they go wrong. Then the overpriced equity markets and the bond markets. If enough of that stuff goes south there will be broken pension funds, very few surviving banks, and what’s left of the Boomer generation gets financially wiped out. This late in the game, it’s hard to see how that can be averted. If it plays out, you will see widespread hardship that makes the Great Depression of the 1930s look like one bad day at the races. Trump & Company know that this debacle is ‘out there’ like a Cat-5 hurricane spinning in the Gulf Stream. They are trying to run a practical work-around program of re-industrializing the country so we can become a production-based society for the broad middle rather than a game-playing economy for the hedge-fund bunch. They are using strong-arm tactics with other nations to get reindustrialization paid-for with foreign investment and tariffs. It’s a tough play because reinvestment and rebuilding can’t happen overnight. It’s a long-game, too. And in the short-term the financial games are getting ready to blow. Much depends on how SCOTUS rules on the president’s Article II power to use tariffs as an instrument of foreign policy. The president claims he has work-arounds in the event that the decision goes against him. If SCOTUS does rule against Trump on tariff power and dismantles what he has put in place in 2025, the markets, banks, and currencies will wobble and crash. Their decision is a game of Russian roulette, and you can be sure they know it. You’ll see headlines such as: SCOTUS Destroys Global Economy. Prediction: SCOTUS won’t dare disable Mr. Trump’s tariff weapon. Decision in early spring. The longer they drag it out, the more potential damage. Let’s say there is some sort of crash in 2026, anyway. The equity markets teeter at super-record highs. There is a complete departure in trendlines between the financial part of the economy and the on-the-ground economy of businesses and services that have become increasingly unaffordable. Cars, apartments, groceries, medical stuff, you know: the basics. So far, reindustrialization remains a plan, a dream. Very few of those factory jobs have materialized and the in the immortal words of the late Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. Sidebar: The Specter of AI A lot of the money in equity markets is pouring into Artificial Intelligence (AI), mainly the insanely overpriced Nvidia. AI is supposed to be the engine of the next tech revolution. I demur. I suspect it will disappoint. It will not make our lives better, it will, at best, just make a lot of common operations in daily life more frustrating by removing humans from the equation; and, at worst, it will destroy the human race. I tend to see it flopping on the ‘at best’ side. Your life has already been made worse by computer interventions in daily life, case-in-point: your attempts to contact a business. Computers cut you off at the pass. . . poorly designed phone “tree” answering programs waste hours of your time before they completely fuck up whatever transaction you attempt: a dinner reservation, a product return, a complaint to the Internet service, an attempt to get your medical lab report. Applied AI will only spread that nonsense into every other available niche in your existence. Nothing will work. No one will answer. And that can only go on so long before you get a revolution, a social collapse, a systems apocalypse, a one-way ticket back to the medieval. Coupla other obvious failure-points in the AI dream: 1) As AI increasingly “trains” on material created by AI, it becomes a self-referential hallucination of false data. You won’t be able to rely on anything it “thinks,” or any task it is assigned to carry out. And that doesn’t include its potential for going rogue and developing evil intentions of its own. And 2) The obvious strain on electric power generation, the grid. Investments in new electric generating capacity may be greater than any economic return from AI, whether the added power is nuclear or something more amazingly new and exotic that hasn’t been invented yet. Plus, AI server requirements are already making electric service unaffordable for everyday people. Economically, the thing begins to look like a mirage, including the titanic investments being made in it. Finally, imagine the psychological effect of generalized AI failure. It will put the basic notion of technological progress into a fatal funk as the human race has to go back to the drawing-board and find some other way to keep economic growth going in a finite world. Anyway, a financial train wreck can take different forms, depending on how the authorities respond to the first tremors. Could be a failure of our currency, the dollar, and steeper inflation, where you have a lot of money that has little value and can’t buy much. Could be a massive deflation in which debt failure is acknowledged and money dissipates, leaving behind a scant supply of money that still has value, but not enough to go around. . . meaning many people are just broke. Stock and bond market blowups will just be manifestations of these basic financial illnesses, failures of faith really. Prediction: We do get a crash in equities and bonds. Mr. Trump has to take on the FDR role in a hurry. It might require yet another kind of national emergency to allow a restructuring of US finance that protects the broad middle class from penury. It will take some luck for Mr. Trump to find a way to accomplish this restructuring, but Donald Trump has experienced this kind of brush with ruin personally and he knows how a calamity like this can be turned around. We’ll have to stand by to see how he plays it, how it plays him, and how history plays him and us. It will have to include novel moves besides just the same old federal reserve money-printing a shuck-and-jive. Prediction: expect real novelties, like abolishing the Federal Reserve altogether and reassigning money-issuance to the US Treasury, using a partially gold-backed dollar. Mr. Trump is already making noises about abolishing the federal income tax altogether. And there’s no question that he would love a chance to severely cut down the size and scope of the federal government so, at least, everyday people can carry on in businesses without many of the onerous regulatory burdens that make everything so difficult now. A financial emergency would require a comprehensive reform of health-care including the dismantling of hospital cartels, insurance behemoths, and all the nonsensical bureaucracy that has turned every doctors’ office into something that looks like the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Oil Scene and Energy Superficially, the numbers paint a sanguine picture, but like the black gold itself, the story lurks below the surface. The US Energy Information Agency shows total US oil production for 2025 at an all-time record high of 13.61-million barrels-a-day (b/d). The agency predicts just a bit under that for 2026: 13.53-million b/d. The US-EIA is traditionally optimistic. Americans want cheap oil and they want lots of it. The shale oil “miracle” has delivered a lotta oil as President Trump might say. We’ve been stupendously fortunate the past decade-and-a-half. Some big howevers, however. Shale oil is very expensive to get out of the ground with horizontal drilling, fracking, trucked-in frack water, chemicals, and special fracking sand. It requires very fancy financing, and the state of finance (that is, lending) generally looks shaky going forward. The oil industry has always been a precarious business. The current price of $57-a-barrel (West Texas Crude) is not high enough to provide a return-on-investment for most operators. Break-even lies between $70-90 a barrel. Lenders are reluctant to lend where there is a poor prospect for return-on-investment. But, of course, Americans demand cheap gasoline and low oil prices destroy the companies that are supposed to deliver the cheap gasoline. It’s a predicament with no easy answer. The current numbers suggest the US has finally entered a production plateau preceding major decline by 2028. The drilling rig count in the Permian Basin in late 2025 was 20 to 25 percent lower than in 2024, from 308 active rigs in 2024 to 246 rigs as of Dec 19, 2025. The Permian Basin accounts for nearly half of all US drilling rigs. The US-EIA also expects the average oil price for 2026 to hover at $55 average, lower than the all-year average $69 for 2025. Prediction: under those circumstances, a lower rig-count will bring some oil company bankruptcies, plus accelerating depletion because Permian Basin shale oil wells decline by 70 percent after the first year and lower rig counts mean fewer new wells to replace that lost production. Drill baby, drill is a nice rallying cry, but it would be years before any production could come out of Alaska’s ANWR fields, if ever. If US oil companies return to Venezuela, global supply will go up and the price of oil could decline further. As for the vaunted green energy revolution, independent analyst Art Berman, refers to this as “Renewable Derangement Syndrome: the belief that an ‘energy transition’ is well underway, despite clear evidence to the contrary. It’s the conviction that solar panels and wind turbines are replacing fossil fuels at scale when, in fact, renewables remain a rounding error in global energy supply.” Gold and Silver These things used to be money for thousands of years. For the past hundred years, the financial authorities called it a “barbarous relic.” Now, gold and silver are back, sort of, but first in the role of messenger. Surely, you’ve noticed that gold zoomed from just over $2600/oz to $4500/oz through 2025, while silver moved from $29/oz to $80/oz just after Christmas 2025. Epic moves (followed by a sharp correction New Year’s week). Supposedly, the silver market is super-agitated by the industrial need for silver in electric cars, robot electronics, and the hardware for AI. That’s part of the story. While there are plenty of technical factors, cycle explanations, and parties still manipulating the market price of precious metals, the main message of the metals must be an apprehension of social and political upheaval ahead. Metals move when people are afraid that the basic social contract is falling apart. . . that war might be coming. Everything in this forecast has spoken of unrest, upheaval, inflection points, and the circulation of elites. Gold and silver are what people turn to when they lose confidence in the institutions that stand behind money, namely governments and central banks. They also lose trust in things that purport to represent money. Those things all have counterparties lodged in the agreements around debt. Our debt-based money system is delaminating, with the various layers peeling off into worthlessness: mortgages, loans, bond obligations, etc. The counterparties are the persons or entities who offered the loan and the persons or entity who can’t pay back the loan. When that breaks, when loans don’t get paid back, money vanishes. Gold and silver don’t have counterparties, they just. . . are. They embody the work and energy that went into finding them, digging them out, smelting them, and assaying them, and that’s all. Central banks around the world have been buying up gold and silver with increasing avidity because nations are moving to currencies that are at least partially backed by precious metals. Such a move will severely cut down the issuance of loans, especially loans used to leverage investment positions in other financial instruments — that is, to blow market bubbles. Prediction: sometime in late 2026, gold will arrive at $7,500 and silver will rise to $150 or $200. Paper currencies pegged to nothing but vaporous claims of the full faith and credit of the government, or the backing of an imperial navy, have been the norm for several generations. Sometimes, the bottom falls out of your norm bucket, and you have to make new mental arrangements. In a gold-backed money ecosystem, the opportunities for many kinds of financial legerdemain expire. Swindles are still possible, but as far less complex con-jobs. Further prediction: if this effort fails and paper currencies can no longer be trusted at all, everyday transactions might devolve to circulating silver coin, for a while, anyway, in which case the standard of living will be a whole lot lower for everybody. Bitcoin It is nothing more than the fugazy of all fugazies. It has no essential, discernable, real value. It’s astonishing that it got this far, but it is more complex than a tulip bulb and hyper-complexity appeals to people in finance. It creates evermore opportunities for swindles and frauds. Even if blockchain technology itself has some value, Bitcoin is still a worthless fugazy, sustained only by the general climate of psychosis in finance. As the psychosis lifts, Bitcoin’s value will sink. Prediction: by the third quarter of 2026, Bitcoin is back below $25,000 and headed for extinction. Concluding Notes As usual, apologies for going on so long. 2026 will require more than the usual fortitude, especially for those stuck in conventional investments and who are gurgling under water on mortgages and other loans. On the political front: expect broad and serious prosecutions of many known villains who, one way and another, tried to overthrow the republic since 2016. Unlike just about everybody else in the forecasting business, I don’t believe the Democratic Party will be able to take back the House of Representatives or the US Senate in the 2026 midterms. They have left too wide a slime trail of corruption, avarice, lunacy, and treason. Lastly, a salute to the intrepid President Donald J. Trump, for all his faults, a true American hero.

Like one of the smart guys said awhile ago, the tragedy is not that a few people get up to really bad stuff, the tragedy is that so many sit at home doing nothing about it.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval. Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2025. T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund will be merged with and into the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund on or about April 17, 2026. Around the same time, the T. Rowe Price International Disciplined Equity Fund will be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the T. Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund. VictoryShares International Volatility Weighted ETF will liquidate on or about February 4, 2026.

Title: China pushes robot access mainstream with Qingtianzhu’s 1 RMB ‘flash rental’ service

UPDATED 19:29 EST / DECEMBER 31 2025 by Duncan Riley Though 2025 may be remembered for the artificial intelligence boom, not far behind has been the emergence of advanced humanoid robotics. And while the U.S. and the West more broadly have somewhat lagged in robotics, China enters the new year arguably well ahead in the robotics game. According to a report Tuesday from Chia-focused tech site Pandaily on New Year’s Eve, Chinese company Qingtianzhu (Shanghai) Technology Co. Ltd. has launched a “1 RMB robot rental” service across 10 major cities, marking one of the most aggressive attempts yet to normalize on-demand access to humanoid robots. 1 RMB is 14 cents in U.S. dollars. The initiative allows users to reserve humanoid robots for short-term use via QR code, with centralized scheduling designed to support deployment across multiple scenarios. The service is currently available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing. It’s positioned as a way to lower barriers to experimenting with humanoid robots in commercial and public settings. Sina Finance reported Tuesday that the 1 RMB price is a promotional entry point that is intended to attract first-time users and accelerate adoption rather than reflect the full commercial cost of robot deployment. Qingtianzhu describes the offering as a “flash rental” model with rapid booking, standardized service workflows and dedicated on-site personnel to ensure stable operation during events. The move is described by Chinese media as part of a broader effort to build a national robot leasing ecosystem. Qingtianzhu’s platform is acting as a kind of “robot Didi,” designed to match demand from businesses, exhibitions, conferences and brand activations with available robot inventory across cities. Didi is mainland China’s most popular ride-hailing service provider and is often described as the Uber of China. The long-term goal is reportedly to scale robot leasing in a way that mirrors ride-hailing and equipment-sharing platforms rather than traditional industrial procurement. The real significance of the initiative lies in distribution and utilization, not margins. The idea is that by encouraging frequent, short-term rentals, Qingtianzhu can gather operational data, refine deployment workflows and expose more customers to humanoid robots in real-world environments. The 1 RMB price could also be described as a loss leader to introduce people to the benefits of renting robots and over time, drive demand for higher-value rentals, long-term leases, or customized robotic services. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the idea of robot rental services is still a pipe dream, though some companies are getting closer with their robotic endeavors. Tesla Inc. debuted its Optimus robots in October 2024 to much fanfare, but not much has been heard of the offering since. With China surging ahead in robotics, companies in the West have a lot of catching up to do, but as AI continues to improve and hence the ability to control robots, 2026 should see more movement in the market. The dream that one day there will be a robot in every house isn’t that far off, albeit one far closer to reality in the Middle Kingdom than in middle America.

Full Content:
Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval. Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2025. T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund will be merged with and into the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund on or about April 17, 2026. Around the same time, the T. Rowe Price International Disciplined Equity Fund will be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the T. Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund. VictoryShares International Volatility Weighted ETF will liquidate on or about February 4, 2026. Volatility Shares 2x Wheat ETF and 2x Corn ETF disappear on January 30, 2026. Voya Global Perspectives Portfolio will be liquidated on or about May 15, 2026. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Wealth quote of the day by Bill Ackman: “Investing is one of the few businesses where you can do everything right and still lose money in the short term. What matters is a strategy that works long term—and the discipline to ignore the noise.” Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is a name synonymous with high-stakes Wall Street drama. Ackman has spent decades perfecting a strategy known as activist investing. Unlike traditional investors who buy and sell quietly, Ackman takes massive, concentrated stakes in companies and publicly demands structural changes to unlock value.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye. They did indeed launch after impressing us at CES. Two of our sister sites, ZDNET and Mashable, have reviewed the buds. Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size. The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves. If anything, I ended up liking it even more, awarding it 4.5 stars and an Editors’ Choice for its picture quality. It’s the brightest OLED I’ve ever tested and looks fantastic. I’d still recommend LG’s C5 (another Editors’ Choice, and the successor to the C4 I use at home) to most shoppers for its also-excellent picture and significantly lower price. —Will Greenwald Honda’s two funky electric cars are currently in development, and the SUV model is on track for a 2026 North American launch, Honda tells us. In October, the Japanese automaker unveiled an updated prototype of it in Japan—and the sleek, futuristic silhouette would certainly make waves on the road. The Saloon, a sedan model that’s likely to be less popular in the US, has been pushed back to 2027. —Emily Forlini Last year's top AI announcement from CES wasn't a chatbot or an AI-infused gadget. Instead, it was a unique foundation model, Nvidia Cosmos, which was developed as the first "world foundation model" built not for generating images or carrying on conversations, but to simulate and replicate the physical world to train future robots, self-driving cars, drones, and other autonomous tech. Instead of real-world training in closed courses and lab conditions, this model would accurately replicate those conditions virtually, allowing robots to be trained virtually. As we said last year, this virtual sandbox "could be the platform that enables future CES innovators...for years to come." One year later and this ambitious project has matured considerably. Since that CES announcement, the model has been released as open source for easier downloading and deployment. Major updates have introduced prediction capabilities, embedded reasoning agents, controllable world generation, and support for large-scale synthetic data generation. And companies are already taking advantage of it. Top robotics and AV companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, and Uber, were early adopters of the platform, and it's part of the training and simulation loop for many more major robotics and autonomous vehicle programs. It may not be the kind of flashy consumer-facing technology that people see in reviews and ads, but it's already a major part of the future that's being built.—Brian Westover The Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV demonstrated its mettle in our testing, following up on its Best of CES 2025 with a four-star review and a PCMag Editors’ Choice. It has proven itself a capable and far more cost-effective alternative to the Pro Display XDR, which has the same screen size and resolution, although not quite matching the elite performance of Apple’s 6K flagship monitor. We’ll see how the PA32QCV stacks up against a new wave of 6K displays now coming through PC Labs. —Tony Hoffman The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D looked impressive on paper when it was announced during CES last year. When it launched in April 2025, test results showed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D to be arguably the fastest consumer processor of the year. In gaming, it has no real competitor, and only the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K can offer competition against the 9950X3D in non-gaming workloads. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains the fastest CPU for consumers to date, and there are no signs of a new strong competitor emerging soon, so the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is set to hold this position for some time to come. —Michael Justin Allen Sexton Following up on the elite-performing but energy-hogging Editors’ Choice Crucial T700 and T705, which require substantial heatsinks to avoid thermal throttling, Micron’s latest PCI Express 5.0 SSD, the Crucial P510, is a more mainstream, power-efficient model that ships with a simple heat spreader. While the P510 is a capable model, its performance numbers were more sedate than its predecessors in our testing, allowing Sandisk’s WD Black SN8100, which combines energy efficiency with record-setting benchmark numbers, to wrest PCMag’s PCI Express 5 SSD crown away from the Crucial line. —Tony Hoffman Our favorite PC DIY product at CES 2025, this Corsair case didn’t take long to get into our hands and on the market. The Frame 4000D received a four-star rating in our February review, and the chassis proved to be a solid entry, thanks to its unique front panel and easy build experience. It’s something of a budget model, and even more so since launch. Discounted widely at this writing to $99 and equipped with three ARGB fans, it’s a good bet for a first-time PC builder these price-sensitive days. —John Burek Flint has not posted any news on its site since December 2024—right before last CES—but that’s not because it’s gone belly up like startups tend to do. Quite the opposite. The Singapore-based company started producing its first two battery products in early 2025, CEO and Founder Carlos Charles tells us, and has “collaborations with leading brands, including Logitech, Amazon Devices, Apple, and others.” More details to come at CES 2026. —Emily Forlini One of the oddest gadgets to get attention at the show is Kirin’s electric spoon, which sends a low-intensity electric current through your tongue to make salty and umami flavors pop more without using as much actual salt. It’s an interesting idea, and as someone who’s licked his share of 9-volt batteries, I see the logic behind it. And, as far as I can tell from the slew of CES 2025 news stories highlighting it and very little other English-language coverage, it never came to this side of the Pacific. Vendors on eBay are selling it for $200 to $300 if you really want to get one, though. I’m more of a Kiuichi man than a Kirin one myself, anyway. —Will Greenwald Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Title: The Best Products of CES 2025: Where Are They Now?

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. It's been a wild year for tech innovation, and last January we previewed many of its most compelling new products at the Las Vegas Convention Center. As always, we searched the halls and rooms far and wide to examine cutting-edge gadgets and prototypes from more than 4,000 companies. To wrap up the show, we brought you our definitive list of the Best Tech of CES 2025—the 21 products that delighted us the most, and seemed destined to influence the rest of the industry in the months and years to come. CES is once again just a few days away, and we're all set to fly to Las Vegas. (Indeed, our joint digital media division, CNET Group, is choosing the official CES 2026 best-in-show winners, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association.) But before we pack our bags, we asked our experts to look back at the best innovations they picked from last year's show. We wanted answers to the most critical questions: What were our choices like in the real world as actual production models? Did they measure up when we tested them, or did they disappoint? Did they even come out at all? Here's what our experts discovered. When we first saw the Asus Zenbook A14, we were impressed by its slim, lightweight design, distinctive magnesium-alloy construction and Ceraluminum design, and long-lasting battery—enough to name it the best laptop of CES 2025. When we reviewed it in May, I was still wowed by all of those details, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus was a bit underwhelming, even for a Copilot+ PC. But even with low test scores, the Zenbook A14 still earned a 4-star rating as an excellent ultraportable system. It may not have won an Editors' Choice award, but it's currently listed as both the Best Windows Ultraportable Laptop Under $1,000 and the Best Budget OLED Laptop, making it a smart buy for many.—Brian Westover We first got a look at the (confusingly named) Vision X AI 2nd at Computex 2024, before seeing it again in a more developed state at CES. It's a sizable and powerful gaming desktop in its own right, but its calling card is a 13-inch touch display on the front panel. This full HD panel can be used to show system diagnostics, apps, or even as a second monitor. The "AI" and "2nd" in its name refer to the NPU-bearing Arrow Lake 200 processors inside, while top-end Nvidia GPUs power gaming and graphics workloads. The main update about how this fared in 2025? It finally went on sale as a finished product, though stock is limited and configurations cost many thousands of dollars. (MSI is currently selling one model on its website for $5,499). We didn't review it ourselves yet, but it is now available for interested enthusiasts. —Matt Buzzi The Lenovo Legion Go S is a system full of potential, but when I finally got my hands on the Windows 11-powered handheld, its gaming performance ultimately let me down. The AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor proved too underpowered to deliver substantial gains over its predecessor and inherited much of its predecessor's clunkiness. However, Lenovo rectified most of the system’s flaws with the release of a SteamOS variant. With Windows 11 out of the picture, games performed far better than they did on the Windows-powered Go S, and it’s our recommendation for Steam Deck users looking to upgrade their system. —Zackery Cuevas MSI’s Project Zero X was an experimental “what next?” iteration on the company’s Project Zero, an initiative for PC building that enables super-minimalist, clean-looking desktop PCs. Project Zero uses motherboards with connectors on the underside of the PCB to let you hide all the PC’s internal cables behind the board. CES 2025’s Project Zero X took that to another level, with the whole board front covered in fancy heat sinks and the usual rear-edge panel of I/O ports—for monitor, audio, USB, and the like—relocated to the actual back of the board too, letting you put this PC, say, up against a wall with nary an external cable in sight, either. Predictably, though, Project Zero X has not seen the light of day beyond a trade show. The board we saw is highly proprietary, as was the outer chassis. With no sign of new Zero X-style boards or cases, the original “Zero” is all you can buy today. We’ll be on the lookout for any Zero X developments at CES 2026, though. —John Burek Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 impressed us at CES 2025 and again in May when we reviewed it. This gaming-focused tablet is small yet powerful, thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor with a dedicated vapor chamber to manage thermals and 12GB of RAM to run applications. We really like its pixel-rich screen, which measures 8.8 inches and has 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate for fast gaming action. In our review, we called it a “small tablet with big power,” and that’s exactly the experience it delivers at a reasonable $389. —Iyaz Akhtar The HMD Offgrid showed a lot of promise at its CES 2025 debut. This puck provides basic satellite SOS functionality for any smartphone across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The idea is to allow for connectivity in backcountry regions where traditional cell service isn’t available, enabling emergency communications if needed. While the puck itself is inexpensive at $149.99, the associated service fees tally up quickly, according to subscriber reviews. Moreover, those who purchased and used the Offgrid suggest that customer support is limited and connectivity is inconsistent. Although the product is still available for sale, it appears that it never gained traction. The good news is that many US-based smartphone users have access to emergency satellite-based SOS services from their carrier, or even directly from Apple (if they have an iPhone). —Eric Zeman For something as seemingly future-tech as a robotic arm on a vacuum, the Saros Z70 didn't take long to come to market. I reviewed it mere months after it wowed us at CES. In practice, the robot arm needs another generation or two to bake, as it currently only works with a few objects and only on hard floors. It's more of a novelty than a useful extra, and the underlying robot vacuum itself isn't worth the premium $2,599 list price. —Andrew Gebhart The Ultraloq Bolt Mission isn't out yet. Ultraloq is still around, and so we might find out more about this lock and its release date at the upcoming show. It still sounds cool, with its unique combination of ultrawide-band and NFC tech that lets your door sense your precise location for automatic unlocking. The company's name holds prestige, as it has another lock on top of our current best list. So, I'm holding out hope that this one hits retailers soon and lives up to its promise, even if the eventual delivery is later than we initially hoped. —Andrew Gebhart Combining noise cancelling with a comfortable design, the $349 Ozlo Sleepbuds are meant to help you seal yourself away from the world when it's time to get some shuteye. They did indeed launch after impressing us at CES. Two of our sister sites, ZDNET and Mashable, have reviewed the buds. Ozlo won an Editors' Choice award from the former and a score of 3.8 (out of five) from the latter, with both praising their comfort and docking them for the slow launch of their promised sleep tracking feature. —Andrew Gebhart Adding to the growing category of smart rings with cool new features like taking an ECG and detecting atrial fibrillation from your finger, the Circular Ring 2 was also promising at CES for its simplified, app-based system for judging your ring size. The Circular Ring 2 did come to fruition in 2025, but our sister site ZDNET noted some meaningful shortcomings that made its appealing $249 price less attractive, such as a laggy app, slow syncing, and inaccurate data. —Andrew Gebhart The XReal One Pro stood out at CES 2025 for its still-impressive 57-degree field of view, but that isn’t why it ended up earning our Editors’ Choice for AR smart glasses, or why it’s become a regular part of my travel gear. Its head-tracking enables an ultra-wide mode that simulates a 3,840-by-1,080 monitor, which is big enough that you'll need to turn your head to see everything. It’s incredibly useful if, like me, you need either two monitors or an ultrawide to get any work done. XReal is working on more impressive projects, like the Android XR-powered Project Aura development kit. But for now, the XReal One Pro is just an excellent wearable display to use away from your desk. —Will Greenwald These over-ear headphones from JBL packed a wireless transmitter in the case, allowing you to stream audio content from just about any source. Think airplane in-seat entertainment systems or even your record player at home. As long as you have a 3.5mm or USB-C port available, you can pair the JBL Tour One M3 headphones and enjoy. This feature led to their award and CES 2025, and we still found it compelling once the headphones reached the market in April. But connectivity isn’t everything: The Tour One M3 headphones have 40mm Mica Dome drivers that produce rich sound, eight microphones to handle calls, active noise cancellation, lossless audio, and spatial sound. The noise cancellation wasn’t the best we’ve tested, but it was decent enough. In our review, we also appreciated the extensive 70 hours of battery life per charge and their support for new Bluetooth technologies, like Auracast. Perhaps the only bummer is that tariffs increased the price from $399.99 to $449.99 shortly after they reached the market. —Eric Zeman My CNET colleague David Katzmaier was right when he pinned down the LG G5 as the best-looking TV at the show that year, which is why both CNET and PCMag (me personally) gave it high marks when we were able to test it ourselves.

Title: Warren Buffett’s blind spot: Did the digital economy leave him behind?

Time Published: 2025-12-30T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett is to investing what Einstein was to physics, Edison was to invention, and Mozart was to music. There will never be another one like him, and you should pity anyone who says they aspire to be “the next Warren Buffett.” Whenever I hear someone talk about “the next Warren Buffett,” I think of Antonio Salieri, Mozart’s inferior rival, played brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham in the movie Amadeus. In the film’s climactic scene, Mozart dictates his Requiem to Salieri from his deathbed. As Salieri struggles to keep up with the genius pouring forth, his face is equal parts awestruck and ravaged. It is the face of a person who knows he is doomed—not to failure, but to something perhaps even worse: mediocrity. As we pause to honor the master’s legacy, however, it’s clear that Buffett’s oeuvre is in fact divided into two distinct periods. The first lasted from shortly after he graduated from Columbia Business School in 1951 as Ben Graham’s star pupil to the end of the dot.com bust. If you had invested in Buffett’s partnership in the early days and then rolled your money into Berkshire Hathaway when that old textile company became his investing vehicle, over the next fifty years you would have nearly 500 times more money than if you’d invested in the S&P 500. You don’t get a sense of how awesome, in the original sense of the word, that figure is until you translate the difference into actual dollars. A million dollars invested in the S&P from 1957 through 2007 would have been worth $166 million—but a million invested with Buffett would have been worth almost $81 billion. Fast forward another 18 years, and your $1 million with Buffett is now worth almost $428 billion. This is where the legend of Buffett’s genius rightly springs. What is less well known, however, and even less discussed, is that these first five decades account for more than 100% of Buffett’s career outperformance. While he beat the S&P by a factor of almost 500 in his first fifty years, he has underperformed it in the eighteen years since. As the chart below shows, a million dollars invested in the S&P from the end of 2007 through mid-December 2025 would today be worth $6.6 million, almost 25% more than the $5.3 million you would have earned in Berkshire’s stock. The data lead to an obvious conclusion. For most of the 21st century, Buffett’s record was mediocre—Salieriesque, one might say. How could this happen? How could a practitioner as driven and imaginative as Warren Buffett produce such genius, then become slightly below average? These questions are worth pursuing. To understand why Buffett excelled in the 20th century but hasn’t in the 21st will help us understand two things. First, what once made his style of value investing so good. Second, why he faltered, and how value investors must change if we want to excel in the digital age. I realize that by calling attention to these facts I am violating one of value investing’s cardinal commandments: Thou shalt have no other gods beside Warren Buffett. To those deeply immersed in it, value investing, invented by Ben Graham more than a century ago and passed directly to Buffett, resembles a religious order in many ways. It has many principles and precepts and a long list of dos and don’ts. Our discipline, we believe, distinguishes us from growth investors and momentum investors, whom we look down on as heathens. Unlike them, we think, we aren’t stock jockeys or herd followers. We have rules. We trust that these rules will lead us to outperform. And when we do outperform, we believe it is not a matter of luck, but of patiently applied skill. This fixity of purpose can lead to stilted and dogmatic thinking. To suggest that Buffett was Mozart in the first three-quarters of his investing career and then Salieri in his last quarter represents a kind of heresy to many in the value church. Fortunately, one of the many salutary things about value investing is that recourse to hard facts is another of its cardinal principles. Value investing has had one major reformation in its 100-year history, a reformation driven by Buffett himself. As Buffett’s two disparate records suggest, if we are to succeed in the digital age, value investors must again evolve. Like Buffett’s overall record, his magisterial performance in the late 20th century is in fact composed of two discrete periods. The first comes from what Chris Begg at East Coast Asset Management calls Buffett’s Value 1.0 days, when he invested in Ben Graham-like “cigar butts,” companies that were cheap not on the merits of their business quality but on their asset liquidation value. Early on, Buffett scored big with such fire-sale investments as Dempster Mill Manufacturing and National American Fire Insurance. His purchase of Berkshire Hathaway, a dying New England textile mill he bought because it was worth more dead than alive, was the very distillation of Ben Graham’s quantitative, defensive style. Berkshire in fact survives only because Buffett began to listen to his acerbic partner, Charlie Munger. Munger loathed Graham’s cigar-butt approach, referring to it over the years as “madness,” “a snare and a delusion,” and a discipline that “ignored relevant facts.” From the early days of their collaboration, Munger pressed Buffett to look at a business’s earning power rather than its liquidation value, and to use Berkshire as a holding company to invest in such companies. The real money, Munger argued, lay not in a business’s fire-sale value but in its ability to generate growing profits over its lifetime. Buffett embraced Munger’s style, and thus Value 2.0 was born. With its focus on good, growing businesses, Value 2.0 was as suited to the postwar world as Graham’s defensive Value 1.0 was suited to the Depression. The United States in the 1950s was prosperous and remarkably stable, and its business dynamics were resistant to material change. Television, for example, became the dominant mass medium after World War II, and TV itself was dominated by only three national networks for nearly forty years. The same was true of print media. Earlier in the 20th century, major cities like Washington, D.C., had more than 100 newspapers. By 1981, the city had only one, The Washington Post, and Berkshire was a major shareholder. As the 1950s became the 1960s, Buffett and Munger’s key insight into this ecosystem was as simple as it was brilliant. They didn’t label it as such, but in hindsight we can say they diagnosed and then invested in what might be called the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Only a few outlets dominated the media, giving them a chokehold on advertising dollars. Using these channels, dominant consumer-product companies could take incremental market share simply by outspending their rivals. If a company like Budweiser or Coca-Cola began with 50% more revenue than its nearest rival, Bud or Coke could spend the same percentage of revenue on advertising as Miller or Pepsi and still outspend them by 50%. Buffett and Munger understood and exploited this more quickly and more deeply than anyone else. Media companies like Disney and ABC and consumer product companies like General Foods became major Berkshire investments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as did the few big advertising agencies that supported the mass brand-mass media industrial complex. Looking back, it’s remarkable how slow-moving and static competitive dynamics were in the late 20thcentury. Of course there was technological innovation—the silicon chip was commercialized in the 1950s, and on its back the transistor radio and then the mobile phone—but the companies that won in the marketplace were steady, grind-it-out growers in sectors where the battle lines had been drawn and it was easy to identify the commanding players. These sectors included not only media and consumer products but also banks, which often dominated their markets. Buffett loved banks and invested in them profitably for decades, and he extended his interest in financial services to other companies like American Express and GEICO, which combined the best of consumer product companies—brand identity—with the raw scale economies of large financial institutions. Given this, it’s no wonder Buffett came to land on the medieval term “moat” to describe competitive advantage. Buffett learned early on in Value 2.0 that companies with a solid, entrenched competitive position won, and kept winning—slowly but surely, year by year. Likewise, he learned to favor smart, cautious executives who deepened their moat but didn’t try to expand into new territory. Eisenhower, pushing the U.S. Army slowly but surely toward Germany in 1944, was the right archetype for Buffett. Napoleons made for good copy but almost always overreached. In the late 20th century, investing with this template proved extremely lucrative. Markets rewarded plodders and punished risk takers and innovators. When in 1985 Coca-Cola announced it was changing its formula to “New Coke,” its customers were so angry that Coke went back to the same mixture John Pemberton had come up with in 1886. As one of the three major national television networks, all ABC had to do was produce reasonably good programming to keep its hold on millions of American eyeballs. My favorite example of all is that of Scotch Tape, which was invented during the Depression by an engineer at 3M named Richard Drew. Despite its enormous mass-market appeal, no competitor tried to improve upon Scotch Tape for more than a generation after its introduction. Scotch Tape thus had the profitable niche of consumer adhesive to itself for thirty years. Can you imagine a company today maintaining its lead for thirty months, let alone thirty years, absent any innovation? As for investment in technology, Wall Street regarded it for much of the 20th century as a kind of social utility: It was wonderful for civilization, but it was terrible for stockholders. All too often, research and development spending in semiconductors and related technologies was deemed speculative or, just as bad, easily copied and therefore moatless. As a result, even into the late 1980s, good Value 2.0 investors like Peter Lynch dismissed tech stocks as a reliable way to make money. “For every single product in a hot industry,” Lynch wrote in One Up on Wall Street, “there are a thousand MIT graduates trying to figure out how to make it cheaper in Taiwan.” Then, sometime around the turn of the millennium, the world began to change. Ironically, the tipping point came right after the dot.com crash, which was the ultimate proof point to “good investors” that investing in tech stocks always ended poorly. What these investors failed to account for was the ineluctable power of Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law is as simple as it is profound: It stipulates that roughly every two years, computing power becomes twice as powerful with minimal incremental cost. Moore’s Law guaranteed that by the year 2000, computing power had become 30 million times more powerful than when semiconductors were commercialized in the 1950s. Thirty million times is a lot, but it wasn’t enough to generate the critical mass of a digital ecosystem. In 2000, for example, only 1% of the world’s population could access broadband internet, and only 15% could afford a cellphone. This goes a long way to explaining the dot.com crash—there simply wasn’t enough computing power to support the connected world we see around us today. However, Moore’s Law didn’t stop during or after the dot.com crash. Computing power became 30 million times more powerful between 2000 and 2002, then 60 million times more powerful between 2002 and 2004, and so on until sometime around 2010, it became strong enough to enable the technology-rich environment we now inhabit. Today, well more than half of the world’s population has both broadband access and a powerful smartphone. Today, much of the world searches, shops, chats, banks, and performs many other everyday activities online. Because consumers tend to standardize on a single application—Facebook for social media, Microsoft for office tools, Google for search—you also have tech companies that possess the customer loyalty and predictability that Buffett rightly craved. Suddenly, entire economic sectors became existentially threatened by digitally driven alternatives, and these threats extended to most of the hunting grounds that Buffett and Munger had for so long favored. Mass media, already disrupted by the advent of cable television, became even more fragmented as Google, YouTube, and Facebook usurped television’s dominion. In a fragmented media landscape, powerful brands like Coke and Budweiser could no longer press their advantage; it’s easy now to launch a niche brand using TikTok and Instagram. One of banks’ central pillars, its network of brick-and-mortar branches, is increasingly less relevant in a world that does much of its business digitally. Buffett and Munger found it hard to adjust to such changes—and at their age, who wouldn’t? Buffett was 73 when Google IPO’d. It’s difficult to fault him for not quite tuning in to the new narrative. On the other hand, at times Buffett demonstrated an almost willful resistance to the changes brought on by the digital age. He never learned how to use email, for example, and he gave up his flip phone for a smartphone only in 2020, thirteen years after the advent of the iPhone and four years after he invested in Apple. Exquisitely comfortable in the late 20th century ecosystem, he loved reading physical newspapers every morning and talking on the telephone from his office in the Midwest. Every year, he’d take the stage in Omaha for his annual meeting and drink his Cherry Cokes and eat his Dilly Bars. Munger would make a wisecrack, break off a chunk of See’s peanut brittle, and it was all good—until it wasn’t. Still, Buffett was too brilliant a business analyst not to grasp what was happening. He and Munger saw how digital businesses like Google were radically better businesses than even his best Value 2.0 investments. Coke sold sugar water, which had big margins, but to get to market Coke had to build bottling plants and establish a network of trucks and vending machines. When a software company wants to enter a new geographic market, its engineers simply write new code, hit “deploy,” and voila—the product is available around the globe, instantaneously and with almost no incremental costs. The result has been the rise of the most successful companies ever produced. Even though Coke was incorporated in 1892 and Alphabet was incorporated more than a century later, Alphabet now makes more than $100 billion in annual profit—nearly ten times more than Coca-Cola. In what amounted to an extemporaneous master class on the power of digital economics, Buffett acknowledged this superiority at his 2017 meeting. “This is a very different world than when Andrew Carnegie was building a steel mill and then using the earnings to build another steel mill and getting very rich in the process, or Rockefeller was building refineries and buying tank cars and everything,” Buffett told the crowd. “I don’t think people quite appreciate the difference. “Our capitalist system was built on tangible assets, but this asset-light model is so much better,” he continued. “Andrew Mellon would be absolutely baffled by looking at the high-cap companies now. I mean, the idea that you could create hundreds of billions of value, essentially without assets…” “Fast,” Munger interjected. “Fast, yeah,” Buffett agreed. “You literally don’t need any money to run the five tech companies that are worth collectively more than $2.5 trillion in the stock market, who have outpaced any number of those names that were familiar, if you looked at the Fortune 500 list 30 or 40 years ago, you know, whether it was Exxon or General Motors, or you name it.” This is all standard, brilliant Buffett stuff—but why, aside from Apple, did he never pull the trigger on these stocks? Over the last twenty years he has been consistently underweight technology stocks, and he forewent hundreds of billions of dollars of value creation in doing so. Having evolved so well from Value 1.0 to 2.0, why did he fail to evolve to Value 3.0? And if he had, would it have made his record better? The second question is easier to settle than the first. The answer to it is unquestionably yes—Berkshire Hathaway’s stock performance would have been materially better had he followed through on his observations about the superiority of tech’s business models and invested in more of them. When Buffett started buying Apple nearly a decade ago, if he had deployed excess cash (the cash he didn’t need for potential insurance claims) into each of the three mega-tech stocks besides Apple that he knew best—Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft—I estimate that Berkshire Hathaway’s market cap would not be the $1 trillion it is now, but at least $1.6 trillion. It’s important to note that this calculation incorporates only the market appreciation of these three stocks. If the market had capitalized Buffett’s “getting tech” and given Berkshire Hathaway’s stock a greater premium as a result, then Berkshire’s gain would have been greater. (Berkshire did buy $6.5 billion worth of Alphabet’s stock earlier this year, though it’s not clear whether it was Buffett or his lieutenants who pulled the trigger on the purchase). While rough, my estimates are not crazy. Buffett understood all three stocks well. He was close friends with Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder, who explained the company’s competitive advantages to Buffett many times. At his 2017 annual meeting, Buffett admitted that he “blew it” by not investing in Amazon and Alphabet. Investing a big slug of his cash in these liquid, mega-cap stocks would have solved the “problem of large numbers” that some who seek to rationalize Buffett’s average latter-day record point to. And my estimate assumes that Buffett bought only a single slug of each. To those who say, “Buffett didn’t miss tech—he had Apple,” I would say two things. First, thank goodness Buffett invested in Apple—can you imagine what his recent record would look like if he hadn’t? Second, I would argue that by the time he invested in Apple the company was acting more like one of his mature, moated consumer products companies than it was a company we would recognize as a “tech company:” ambitious and forward-looking in its investment and R&D spending. When Buffett first bought Apple shares in 2016, it had transformed into a business that had much more in common with Coke and Gillette than it did Amazon or Alphabet. People forget that two important things happened in the years immediately before Berkshire began to buy Apple. First, Steve Jobs became terminally ill and was replaced in 2011 by Tim Cook. Suddenly, the design visionary was out, and the man whose main achievement was perfecting the company’s supply chain was in. While Jobs brought us the iPod and the iPhone, he also was responsible for the Lisa and the Newton, and he once almost bought Universal Music, a purchase that would have meant handing over cash or stock worth nearly Apple’s entire market capitalization at the time. That wasn’t going to happen under Cook. The quartermaster had replaced the field marshal. Salieri replaced Mozart, and this suited Buffett fine. Then, two years after the management change, Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight to force Apple to stop accumulating cash and start returning it to shareholders via massive share buybacks. Icahn never said it exactly like this, but the subtext was clear: With the genius gone and the iPhone bringing in billions, it was time to act like a mature consumer products company. Cook had already begun buying back stock, but Icahn wanted him to do much more, and Cook eventually obliged. By 2015, Cook was saying things like, “By and large, my view is for cash that we don’t need, with some level of buffer, we want to give it back. We’re not hoarders.” The next year, Buffett started buying shares. Post-Jobs, Apple was exactly the kind of company Buffett understood and loved. It had a moat, it worked hard to expand that moat, but beyond that it wasn’t terribly ambitious. A technocrat, not an innovator, was in charge. You can easily see this in not only the tone of Cook’s remarks but in his actions. What is Apple’s biggest innovation since Jobs died in 2011? The Apple Watch and—it’s almost sad to say it—AirPods? As you can see from the accompanying chart, Apple ranks near the bottom of the Magnificent Seven in terms of research and development spending as a percentage of sales. Alphabet and Amazon spend nearly twice as much, and Meta spends three times more. It’s hard to argue that Cook’s plan hasn’t worked. The stock has risen more than tenfold since Buffett began buying it, and Apple remains the second-most-valuable company in the world. But Microsoft is up eight-and-a-half times since Buffett began buying Apple; Amazon is up nearly sevenfold; and Alphabet has octupled. All have dramatically outperformed the market, and Buffett had plenty of evidence almost a decade ago that they would. He understood their competitive advantages ago; he admitted he blew it by not buying them; but he didn’t. Why? Because like other good late 20th century investors, Buffett learned that reinvestment, especially in technology, leads to heartbreak rather than value creation. In his era, companies that reinvested often destroyed value rather than created it. But that is not the era we live in today. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and hundreds of other smaller and lesser-known companies all reinvest a double-digit percentage of their revenues in research and development. The superiority of digital business models permits them to. Without a cost of goods sold—zeros and ones are metaphysical rather than physical—what an average tech company spends on R&D exceeds the entire profit margin of the average American corporation by 50%. Today, unlike a generation ago, there’s abundant evidence that companies which invest in the future will and should be rewarded. Amazon’s average P/E multiple has averaged more than 200x since it went public, but the stock continues to appreciate. Why? Because investors continue to believe that Amazon is depressing current profits to maximize future ones. It’s a “jam tomorrow” company rather than a “jam today” one. Apple is more jam today. It continues to return capital, which is fine, but you don’t get something for nothing. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have plowed billions of profits into new industries like cloud computing, driverless cars, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence; Apple is not a major player in any of these mega-trends. The iPhone accounts for most Apple’s profits. What happens if geopolitical friction impairs the company’s smartphone supply chain, which is still heavily dependent on China? And what happens to Apple if worldwide demand for the iPhone falters, which it perhaps already has? Economic nationalism has begun to cause the Chinese to turn to domestic devices, and China accounts for 20% of the company’s sales. If the courts rule that Google can no longer pay Apple to be its default search engine, almost a quarter of Apple’s profit evaporates. These vulnerabilities illustrate the wisdom of Elon Musk’s 2018 dictum that “moats are lame. If your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation.” The wonderful thing about the early 21st century is that, unlike Buffett, we don’t have to choose between mature, moated companies on the one hand and high growth but speculative ones on the other. Today, in a Value 3.0 world, we can have moats and brands and high growth as well. Despite its enormous size, big tech continues to grow its topline at multiples of the growth rate of the American economy. Amazon has been in business for more than a generation but it still has only a single-digit domestic market share of both retail sales and computing operations. The company’s market cap is so large that we tend to forget such statistics, but like age, market cap turns out to be just a number. The investment landscape changed once after World War II, when American business was stable and slowly growing and Buffett could invest with confidence in dominant, moated enterprises. It has now changed again with the advent of huge, winner-take-most digital platform companies—not just the mega-tech companies, but dozens of others like Intuit and Adobe, ARM and Atlassian, Uber and Airbnb. All these companies dominate their niche as much as Coke and Bud did in their day. Because the economy has changed, as value investors we must change with it. Part of this recalibration needs to be quantitative. We need to adjust our metrics to account for companies like Amazon, who spend on the future through the income statement. Such spending penalizes current earnings and makes its stock appear more expensive, but, as GEICO did when Buffett bought the company 30 years ago, the spending boosts future earnings. There’s another, broader recalibration we must also undertake. Just as Munger told Buffett when they were young men, Value 1.0 was useful in its time but, as business and markets evolved, it ignored certain relevant facts. With its emphasis on milking a business rather than reinvesting in it, isn’t it time to say the same regarding Value 2.0? In the end, whether Buffett “missed tech” or not is irrelevant. He has now all but removed himself from the great arena of the stock market, and the best requiem we can give him is to ask how we should proceed ourselves. The only thing more pitiful than hearing about “the next Warren Buffett” is hearing his disciples parroting Buffetisms as if were still 1967, 1987, or even 1997. Many of these disciples have failed to apply the maestro’s maxims to the present day’s radically altered business landscape. “My favorite holding period is forever,” Buffett has said, and it’s a good axiom—but should we be holding businesses like Coke and Wells Fargo, whose best days are likely behind them, or ones like Alphabet and Microsoft? “Price is what you pay, value is what you get,” Buffett has said, and that’s also true—but what does the saying mean in the context of a tech company’s ambitious spending and consequently high P/E ratio? Conversely, what does it mean for a business like Kraft Heinz, a Buffett holding that has systematically failed to reinvest and has thus systematically eroded its business value? Kraft Heinz has so thoroughly failed, in fact, that it’s resorting to the ultimate refuge of corporate scoundrels: a breakup. When I go to Berkshire meetings these days or am around value investors generally, I hear these axioms endlessly repeated, but with little thought to their contemporary meaning. It’s like members of an old, established religion mumbling a catechism without thinking about its relevance to their world today. Buffett and Munger never meant their wisdom to be suspended in amber. They were far more flexible and sophisticated thinkers than that. Value investors need to be, too. Fortunately, as the 21st century enters its second generation, more and more value investors are adapting their templates to a Value 3.0 world. For every holdout like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who continues to rail against tech’s high valuations while owning coal miners and annuity companies, there are investors like Tom Gayner at Markel, Bill Nygren at Oakmark, and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital. They have all used a value-based discipline to make successful investments in tech. My favorite is Lew Sanders, the former CEO of Value 1.0 paragon Sanford Bernstein. During the Great Financial Crisis, Sanders bought banks because they looked cheap using traditional value metrics. Many were in fact worthless, and Bernstein fired him. Forced to start over with his own firm, Sanders decided that the world had changed. He changed with it: His top positions now include Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Taiwan Semiconductor.

One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.
