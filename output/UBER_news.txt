For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed groundwhere billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" fortrying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COOSheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executiveAndy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AIwill eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference,Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO,RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's newBig, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO,Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadellarecently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo's CEOJim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEODara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recentlyweighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO,Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recentlyspoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last yearexpressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEOJohn Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO,Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president,Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEOMichael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president,Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder,Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are"enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. Spanx founder Sara Blakely was still feeling the Fourth of July spirit at the conference, wearing a red shirt with the American flag on it beneath a Sun Valley 2025 jacket. She also had a drink and a notepad in hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Jump to

US stock market steadied Tuesday as Trump's tariff deadline delay gave investors hope for new global trade deals. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures showed modest movement after Trump extended the July 9 tariff start date to August 1, offering trading partners more time to negotiate. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia now have breathing space to respond. While markets remain cautious, the delay sparked optimism that Trump’s firm-yet-flexible stance may open the door for diplomatic progress. Investors now await the Fed minutes and Delta’s earnings to see what’s next for the economy.

Title: Tesla’s troubles are deeper than you think | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:23:43Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Tesla’s troubles go far beyond CEO Elon Musk’s recent dust-up with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” in a social media slap fight over the weekend. But while the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. And the company could even be back to losing money, for reasons unrelated to Musk’s personal politics. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the 2024 campaign, and was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term, with his role in slashing the federal workforce at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But Musk has since announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then. Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8%, as investors were concerned about the implication of Musk’s latest political moves, despite his promises to re-focus on the company. It rebounded only 1.3% in Tuesday trading. “Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company. Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future. “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote. Still, Ives maintained his buy recommendation and $500 price target for the stock in his note. But analysts at William Blair cut their recommendation on the stock to “market perform” or neutral, and also cut their earnings forecast for the company. Because even without the political stink, the Tesla’s financial outlook is suddenly looking notably worse. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. But when Ives posted his belief that the Tesla board should tie Musk’s future pay package to the amount of time he spends at Tesla and have oversight of his political “endeavors,” Musk responded with his own post on X, saying “Shut up, Dan.” Blair’s note pointed out that Trump’s bill not only removed the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, but also eliminated the financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions targets. Emissions fines have historically forced automakers who still build primarily gasoline powered cars and trucks to buy “regulatory credits” from EV companies. Removing those fines eliminates “market demand for Tesla’s credits,” said the note from William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter. The sale of those federal and state credits added $10.6 billion to Tesla’s bottom line since 2019 and often enabled the company to post a profit. Without the revenue from those regulatory credits, the company would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021, and it would have been back in the red again in the first quarter of this year, when its net income plunged 71% compared to a year earlier on sharply lower sales around the globe. Musk has largely downplayed all the recent bad news, saying the company’s future rests on robots, artificial intelligence and self-driving taxis. But the company’s taxi service is very limited to date, launching only in Austin, Texas, for a select group of customers – mostly Tesla fans – and with a Tesla employee riding in the front passenger seat to monitor the car’s performance. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix – by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet. And Tesla’s rollout has had its shares of problems, including a video showing a robotaxi traveling on the wrong side of the road for about half of a block and another video of a robotaxi slowly turning its front wheels into a parked car. While Musk has promised his robotaxi service will be expanding soon across many other cities, he has not given any further details. He also hasn’t said when the Austin service will be expanded to the general public, nor when the company’s human monitors sitting in the front passenger seat will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, Waymo has definitive plans to expand its service to Miami and Washington, DC, next year in partnership with Uber. “We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk’s attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,” said the William Blair note. “We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.” Then there’s the problem of Tesla’s sales. Or rather, the lack thereof. Global sales were down a record 13% in each of the first two quarters of this year, compared to a year earlier, even though demand for EVs overall continues to climb, a further sign of Tesla’s declining market share. Part of the lost EV market share is due to increased competition, both from Western automakers rolling out their own EV offerings, and Chinese automakers that have made a massive push into the market. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US. Demand is likely to weaken further come October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers expires. When a previous version of the tax credit was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company had to cut the price of the car by about half the value of the lost credit. Tuesday Tesla posted on X that “If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it’s now,” referencing the upcoming tax credit expiration and using the acronym for “you only live once.” But Tesla has also faced missteps of Musk’s own doing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales. That is likely to continue even as he moves to distance himself from Trump. In the early months of this year, hundreds of protests were held outside Tesla showrooms in the United States, Canada and Europe. Worries about self-inflicted brand damage started the company’s shares on their downward slide. It prompted Trump, who was still Musk’s ally at the time, to announce he was buying a Tesla for himself. In March, the president hosted an event at the White House urging others to buy the company’s cars. At one point, Musk and Tesla investors might have hoped that in a closely divided country, the lost sales to Trump critics might be at least partly made up for by sales to Trump fans. But Musk seems to now face the possibility of backlash from both sides of the political spectrum. “He’s been able to alienate everyone, which many thought was impossible, but he’s actually been able to do it,” Ives told CNN Monday. “And the problem is, this soap opera just keeps going on.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Shopping Writer for HuffPost With tariffs still threatening to make products more expensive, 2025’s Prime Day deals couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s worth jumping on big sales when they appear so you aren’t stuck paying significantly higher prices on items like personal electronics, tools and foreign goods with the fluctuating economy. According to previous HuffPost coverage, price hikes can affect multiple categories, including tech, major kitchen appliances, Korean skin care and more. Products in all of these categories are on sale for Prime Day July 8 through 11, so we rounded up some of the best deals to help you save on these investments and prevent yourself from having to pay even higher prices for the items you want. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective. Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval. This 10-liter air fryer has 17 preset settings and three racks, with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees. You can bake, air fry, dehydrate or even used the included rotisserie spit to cook a rotisserie chicken. There's also a drip tray to catch messes on the bottom and make cleanup easier. You can clean the air in rooms up to 1,076 feet with this large room air purifier, which has dual air intakes to purify twice as fast (it only needs 60 minutes for a room that size). It operates nearly silent at just 24 dB, and you can choose between four fan speeds or just set it to automatic mode and let it choose for you based on the air quality. There's also a timer with three settings, so you can set it and forget it. The air purifier comes in black or white. Made by the K-beauty company Medicube, this collagen face mask is made to be worn over and can boost your skin's elasticity while you sleep. In addition to collagen, the mask contains skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerin and ceramide NP for hydration, skin barrier maintenance, addressing fine lines and other benefits. The mask dries down in 15 minutes and is designed to peel off easily in one piece for little mess. According to previous HuffPost coverage, home improvement items like tools may be affected by tariffs, so why not stock up on them at a discount while you can? This kit from trusted brand Dewalt contains a cordless oscillating multi-tool, 20V Max battery, blades for cutting wood, a sanding pad with sandpaper and other handy tools. It all comes with a handy tool bag and a storage box. Reviewers say the oscillating tool works on rubber, metal, plastic and wood. More advanced than your average speaker, this amplifier can upgrade your home entertainment system with 60 watts per channel by connecting to your TV, record player and other speakers. The amp is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and you can stream Spotify, Amazon Music and more directly from it. You can use the WiiM app to adjust the volume and other settings from anywhere. A must-have home improvement tool, this cordless drill by Black + Decker uses a 20V Max battery to operate and comes with a charger. The drill features LED lights for visibility, an 11-position clutch and a variable speed trigger for easy control. There's also a built-in bit holder for easy storage. Having an extra screen can help you see everything at once when you're working on a computer or smaller device. This Arzopa monitor has a 1080P, 15.6-inch display that can connect to your other devices with a USB-C cable. The monitor has a dual speaker system to deliver powerful audio, and can connect to a Mac, PC, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and more. Great for a small space like an apartment, dorm or even RV, this portable dishwasher can go right on the countertop and can hold up to two full place settings, or 30+ items. It only consumes 6 liters of water per cycle using the built-in tank, and has five washing programs in addition to an auto-open function and a UV sterilization function. You can even use this to wash fruit. You might be familiar with Cosrx's snail mucin essence, which we've covered here at HuffPost many times. But the essence isn't the only snail mucin product out there — Cosrx also makes this snail mucin moisturizer, which we found to be at a steeper discount. The cream has 92% snail mucin for moisturizing and exfoliating, along with hyaluronic acid. The cream is lightweight and can address redness, dryness and even acne scars. Get two gadgets in one with this dual air purifier and fan from Dyson. The fan circulates air and keeps you cool while the purifier works to trap pollutants in the HEPA filter. You can use Dyson's app to track changes in air quality and pre-set the machine for intervals between 30 minutes and 8 hours. The fan also features a night mode that operates more quietly so it won't disturb your sleep. The Google Nest Thermostat allows you to track your energy consumption, offers recommendations for when it's best to use in-house heating or cooling systems, as well as offers complete control of a home's temperature even when users aren't at home. The thermostat is designed to work without a C wire in most homes and doesn't require professional help to install nor the need for any other Google smart home devices. A lesser known — but perhaps just as good as — alternative to the uber-expensive Dyson Airwrap is the Shark FlexStyle multi-styler, a tool that utilizes the same reverse directional airflow technology and functionality as the famed predecessor, but with some added ergonomic differences. The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls. This tool comes with up to five attachments to meet your styling needs whether you're creating bouncy curls, salon-style blowouts or smoothing frizz. Promising review: "I have been using this beautiful instrument for the past few months and I have to say it is definitely a major time saver in the morning.It’s pretty easy to find your groove with the tool after the first few uses. I will say the handle is long with the curling attachment so I just adjust my grip towards the center of the handle and it actually feels way more balanced. Definitely a tool I enjoy to use for my hair and would recommend!" — Ben This well-known stick vacuum from Dyson makes vacuuming easier than ever thanks to its lightweight body and extra-portable cordless design, with two powerful cleaning modes so you can tailor its suction to the job at hand while enjoying up to 40 minutes of cord-free runtime. Those with pets (or long hair) will also appreciate how effectively this thing traps fur and hair without getting strands tangled in its brush. Plus, it's designed to capture an impressive 99.99% of dust and other allergens in its filter for a cleaner home and cleaner air. Bose infused its signature high-fidelity sound and powerful noise-canceling technology into these over-the-ear wireless headphones that offer 20 hours of listening per charge. Enjoy 11 levels of active noise canceling and a microphone system that allows you to take calls and be heard, even in noisy environments. K-beauty brand Anua makes this pore control cleansing oil with heartleaf, a Southeast Asian plant that has anti-inflammatory properties. You can use it to remove makeup or SPF, or as part of a double-cleansing routine to prevent your pores from clogging. According to the brand, you may begin to see a decrease in your skin's production of sebum (the oily substance your skin produces that can clog and cause breakouts) in as little as four weeks. Instantly get coffee shop-quality espresso in the comfort of your home with this wildly popular full-service espresso machine. Lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos and espresso shots are pulled to precision alongside a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds beans on demand and a frother wand for making perfectly delicious steamed milk.It’s the stuff coffee dreams are made of. HuffPost Shopping managing editor Emily Ruane raves about this Breville machine. “I did as much research as I could and this model seemed to be a popular and well-reviewed option,” she said. “The Breville was pricy, but it gets used at least twice a day. I wake up every morning looking forward to a perfect latte and I truly feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this convenience at home.” Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speaker is an outdoor-ready and super portable device that delivers crystal-clear sound with enhanced bass and zero distortion thanks to an advanced digital signal processor. This 12W speaker is also completely waterproof so you can enjoy up to 24 hours of listening time per charge no matter where you are. It's possible you've seen some version of these overnight hydrogel masks on TikTok that start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into skin, leaving behind a complexion that's plump, hydrated and glass-like. These Biodance masks contain a collagen-peptide that's of a low molecular weight to penetrate deeper into the skin. It also has brightening niacinamide, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and galactomyces to improve skin tone and texture. These high-quality headphones are currently retailing for just $35. Enjoy up to 32 hours of battery life and if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes. Make calls on the go with a “VoiceAware” program that lets you limit how much of your own voice you hear as you talk. These earbuds are water and dust-resistant, perfect for taking on the trail, mowing the lawn or using while working out or working at your desk. When it comes to quickly brewed single-serve coffee, no one does it like Keurig, and their K-Elite model has quickly become a fan-favorite.

Title: Tesla robotaxi incidents spark confusion and concerns in Austin

Morning Rundown: Trump’s new tariff threats, GOP senator wants to undo parts of megabill, and Superman’s alien roots rile up conservatives Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC
