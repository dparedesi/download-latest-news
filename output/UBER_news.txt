Marlow/Saslove & Warwick at Douglas Elliman Real Estate) That Aspen is Colorado’s ritziest housing market has long been a given and last year was no exception — Pitkin County claimed nine out of the 10 most expensive home sales in the state. But a sale that broke the $100 million threshold for the first time in state history helped the town dominate the charts nationally.The second quarter of 2024 was especially notable, with half of the 10 most expensive home sales recorded in the country happening in Aspen, according to real estate brokerage Redfin. For the year, Colorado claimed three of the top 10 sales where a public record was available.“When I moved to Aspen 30 years ago, we were a town of millionaires, not billionaires. Now we are a town of billionaires,” said Brenda Wild, an owner broker with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices in Aspen.Casino mogul Steve Wynn, founder of The Bellagio in Las Vegas, and online stock trading pioneer Thomas Petterfy, teamed up to purchase 419 Willoughby Way in Aspen for $108 million on April 15. The home, the largest on the top 10 list at a commanding 22,405 square feet, is on a street that has earned the title of Colorado’s billionaire row.The property at 720 Willoughby Way in Aspen, Colorado, sold for $60 million in 2024. (Provided by Mandy Welgos)In the neighborhood was the state’s fourth most expensive sale last year at $60 million — 720 Willoughby Way. Four years earlier that same home had sold for $27 million, a common acceleration in value among the top-priced sellers.The desire to get away and claim more space during the pandemic contributed to a run-up in prices in several resort areas. Pitkin County added to the frenzy when it limited the size of new homes to 9,250 square feet, helping make the mega-mansions built in prior decades collectibles for the rich and famous.Wild said the uber-wealthy view Aspen real estate as an asset class where they can park their money and earn a steady return. The location offers a getaway where they can isolate and disappear off the grid if they want or rub shoulders with other shakers and movers on the slopes or at different festivals.“Aspen has the full package and people are coming from all over the world, all the time,” she said. Measured on a per-square-foot basis, the most expensive home on the list was 850 Roaring Fork Road. It went for $7,901 a square foot, which compares to $4,820 a square foot for 419 Willoughby.Outside of Aspen, only Vail managed to sneak a home onto the state’s top 10 list. That was the $40 million sale of 107 Rockledge Road, a 12,447-square-foot property that looks down on Vail Village and has direct access to the slopes.“It was the highest sales price for a single-family home that we have ever had,” said Liz Leeds, who specializes in luxury home sales in both Aspen and Vail. “Vail commands high prices, but not at the same level as what Aspen is doing.” Vail falls more in the price range of corporate executives and high-paid professionals who can’t afford Aspen, Leeds said.

Title: The Gist: AI, a talking dog for the 21st Century.
URL: https://www.thegist.ie/the-gist-3/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T16:21:57Z
Full Content:
Séamas O'Reilly on the year's biggest con, AI. This is a Christmas Cracker Gist. An invited essay by Séamas O'Reilly Joseph "Yellow Kid" Weil is something of a legend.The self-proclaimed “master swindler” was the paragon of the early twentieth century con man. In his time, he posed as the immaculately tailored owner of a talking dog, a medicine show huckster, an oil-field prospector and an infinite number of prestigious businessmen reluctantly cajoled into sharing a surefire stock tip - for a price. He plied his trade on street corners, boardrooms, race-tracks and betting shops, separating his marks from their money via means so ingenious many of them have lived on a century later. If you’ve seen the ruse which serves as the centre point of 1973 crime caper The Sting, you’ll know one of his greatest hits; the fake bookie’s shop, staffed with dozens of stooges, all working in concert to con one rich mark out of his money. He’s said to have scammed Benito Mussolini out of $2 million and, in 1899, was widely reported to have sold a perfectly unremarkable chicken to an oil baron for the measly price of a thumb sized piece of pure gold. That last wheeze was, in fact, so widely reported that it lives on in the foodstuff which was subsequently named in his honour; the chicken nugget. In Weil’s marvellous memoir, Con Man, there is scarcely a paragraph that doesn’t induce lip-smacking glee at his audacity, or the bottomless reserve of credulity he encounters from sober, serious people who, surely you think, should know better. His true genius, conveyed in great detail, was in diagnosing the psychology of the mark, which is to say the psychology of the human soul. In the business of offering “something for nothing”, the person you’re conning is almost always your co-conspirator. "Each of my victims” he writes, “had larceny in his heart.". I return to Weil’s scams, and his judgments of human nature, often. I see them each time, say, a billionaire runs for the American presidency on a platform of helping the downtrodden by cutting taxes for his wealthy friends, or a cohort of British elites succeed in selling ‘sovereignty and independence’ for the measly price of a place within the world’s largest trading bloc. Increasingly, however, I see it most prominently in the vaunted halls of tech, and nowhere more regularly than in the field of AI. To be clear at the outset, there are obviously elements of AI which show promise. The elimination of many rote and tedious tasks in our daily labours should be greeted as a boon, and AI’s work in highly specialised and technical tasks could prove more exciting still. Early developments in linguistics and pattern recognition already suggest that AI could, and hopefully will, lead to terrific advances in everything from ancient translation to early diagnosis of disease. In such use-cases, however, there is very little guff about this technology’s sentience, nor mention of that dreaded unicorn “artificial general intelligence”. They are simply ingenious and exciting tools which have solid and encouraging applications but do not, crucially, gesture toward an omniscience that does not exist, and which be undesirable if it did. As an ordinary internet user, I despise almost every in-road into my life that AI has made in the past few years, from incompetent chat services to bafflingly inchoate Google search functions, and the deadening churn of bots on every social media platform left alive. There are dozens of terrible AI versions of my own book being freely sold on Amazon, one of which I even bought in a futile attempt to scry its contents for some form of meaning. As someone in the creative field, I am sympathetic to the most common critique of AI within that sphere – namely, that its ‘artistic’ output amounts to lazy, error-riddled garbage which is morally and stylistically repulsive, while plagiarising and undercutting actual human artists – but this only nibbles at the edges of how I feel about the topic. Because my main problem with AI is not that that it creates ugly, immoral, boring slop (which it does). Nor even that it disenfranchises artists and impoverishes workers, (though it does that too). No, my main problem with AI is that its current pitch to the public is suffused with so much unsubstantiated bullshit, that I cannot banish from my thoughts the sight of a well-dressed man peddling a miraculous talking dog. The claims made by AI evangelists are so broad and plentiful that compiling a pleasingly long paragraph of purported use-cases is as simple as Googling “AI + [noun]”. Having now done just that, I am happy to report that AI will apparently make you rich, find you a date, make you a better lover, a better parent, a better writer, a better worker, a better boss, a better person, a better soldier, will fight all wars, end all wars, hobble terrorists, empower terrorists, make you immortal, end crime, cause crime, solve the housing crisis, revolutionise architecture, cure cancer, and make you a perfect creamy fettuccine with pineapple and cashew sauce. Some of the above links are more nuanced in their prescriptions, but all advance the same basic claim: AI has world-changing implications for just about every concept or phenomenon you can name, and several you can’t. The problem is, AI is not only unfit to do many of those tasks better (or even more cheaply) than humans, but if it was, in several cases, I’d set fire to every server farm I could find and urge you to do the same. Let’s take Large Language Models as an example, since they’re the most well-known piece of broadly usable AI tech on the market. Much of their notoriety stems from the fact that its hallucinations are so infamous as to be cliché. We all, I’m sure, have our favourites, like meal planners that recommend putting glue on pizza and eating three rocks a day; mushroom foraging bots which suggest users cook and prepare entirely fatal fungi; or supermarket apps that cheerfully prescribe recipes for “aromatic water” AKA chlorine gas. It should be observed that such examples are not merely failures because they advocate things that kill their users (although this is not ideal) but because they take the place of existing repositories of information which had little-to-no use case for replacement. In so doing, they’ve also managed to muddy the waters of online information gathering to the point that that even if we scrubbed every trace of those hallucinations from the internet – a likely impossible task - the resulting lack of trust could never quite be purged. Imagine, if you will, the release of a car which was not only dangerous and unusable in and of itself, but which made people think twice before ever entering any car again, by any manufacturer, so long as they lived. How certain were you, five years ago, that an odd ingredient in an online recipe was merely an idiosyncratic choice by a quirky, or incompetent, chef, rather than a fatal addition by a robot? How certain are you now? Some quibble and say that these are just teething problems, the inevitable – even amusing – first steps of a technology finding its feet. But that next step, itself, seems illusory. The scaling of AI to something more workable will require geometrically more investment and computing power than the squillions it has already swallowed up on its path to being the current shit product that nobody trusts. Even enthusiastic reporting on the success of OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, can’t avoid mentioning that the company is on track to lose $5 billion this year. Up to now, their financing has been driven by massive cash injections from the same cheery ranks of hedge funds, soft banks, and petrostates which have propped up every loss-making company you can name for the last decade, from Uber to WeWork to FTX. As recently as July, we saw signs that the market might not be quite as enthusiastic about doing so anymore. It may not be a bubble, but it certainly looks reasonably bubble-shaped, leading tech writer Ed Zitron to convincingly argue we should be referring to the sector as “Subprime AI”. Cory Doctorow goes further in arguing our only task going forward should be working out what kind of bubble it is, the kind that leaves something behind, or the kind that does not. The cost, both financially and in terms of energy resources, of making good on the promises of Artificial General Intelligence are so vast as to approach Death Star numbers, before we even contend with logistical problems of training AI in the first place. The pool of real-world information on which AI has yet to be trained is not merely dwindling but is, itself, now so polluted by AI-generated content that this task is rendered more difficult still. Chlorine gas air defusers and superglue pizzas are all well and good when they’re merely poisoning amateur cooks, but they have also poisoned the very well from which AI must now train itself, and separating out the hallucinations from real information grows more difficult with every line of robot doggerel these same companies ceaselessly barf into the digital ether. All of which is to elide the real harms of this technology we currently see in the world around us. In his recent, and spectacular, takedown of current AI orthodoxy, The Phony Comforts Of Useful Idiots, Edward Ongweso Jr lists some harrowing examples, such as the incompetent crime detection software currently putting American criminal justice in the hands of the machine, the discriminatory welfare algorithm which wrongly accused 26,000 Dutch families of fraud, and the ongoing use of AI to enable the ‘mass assassination factory’ of Gaza. In all such cases, AI’s “errors” are both devastating, and hard to even label as errors at all, so much as a bleakly useful abrogation of responsibility for the bad actors intent on protecting the dystopian interests of those in power. It is not the thought of eight fingered portraits or garbled auto-generated novels which prompt me to indulge in cheery reveries of burning server farms to the ground. It is the spectre of yet more dehumanised populations, preyed upon by dehumanised systems of state violence. I hate AI because it does not work at most of the things its promoters claim it does, and many of the things it does do are explicitly evil. Its missteps not only kill but dissolve the fragile fabric of trust in information we have left. The jargon of AI boosterism, like NFTs and cryptocurrency before them, has seized the imaginations of punters and investors who believe they’re being led to a world of ease and profit that will change the world and make them filthy rich in the process. It’s the last true “something for nothing” we have left, delivered via mechanisms so abstruse to the lay person that its powers can be described with the folkloric hyperbole of a magic chicken. As a teen, I first encountered Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, and marvelled at its concision. I was too slow, however, to realise the transitive property hidden within his neat equation: if all technology is just magic we don’t yet understand, then any old bollocks can be marketed as technology, so long as it’s conveyed to us via a mage class of tech wizards with a passion for turtlenecks, eugenics, and the removal of vowels from proper nouns. It’s a boom time for our new medicine men. Joseph Weil has nothing on them. The Government has a new policy to increase housing, which is to keep doing their failed policy, but even harder. This is the Gist. Wednesday's Dáil chaos reveals the limits of Executive power. This is the Gist. The election campaign ended with the public's vote but only now do we have a Government. This is the final Campaign Gist. The last of the holiday pieces before normal service is resumed is a short story I wrote when I was 20. This is the New Year's Gist. News, Data policy, law and the absurdity of life. A round up of what Ireland's talking about.

Title: Uber: Growth At A Reasonable Price With Ackman Backing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/02/20/uber-growth-at-a-reasonable-price-with-ackman-backing/
Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:44:11Z

By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period. While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock. Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects. Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue. The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive. Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S. Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call: Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively. Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force. While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment. Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses. Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share. The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options. Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future. Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles. The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.
