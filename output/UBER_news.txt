Great British Menu winner Tommy Banks tells the Money blog about the "political decisions" hurting hospitality in our monthly Cheap Eats feature. Wednesday 7 January 2026 18:52, UK Every month we interview top chefs from around the UK, hearing about their cheap food hacks, views on the industry and more. This week, we speak to Great British Menu winner, Michelin-starred chef and restaurateur Tommy Banks. When I was growing up my mum and dad ran a bed and breakfast... It did mean that every day was basically breakfast service in our house. Everything was just to a fine art and I probably didn't realise at the time, but it definitely had an influence on me. Because it was on a farm, my dad would collect the eggs every morning and then he would crack them all on to saucers. Then he would grade them on look and quality, and then he would decide which ones to use for each job. So only the ones in his A grade would get poached, and then it would be fried, and then scrambled would be the lowest grade. When the family took over the (now Michelin-starred) Black Swan in North Yorkshire, I was 17... I did one year of A-levels, was politely asked not to come back for a second year and started working. It was very much make it up as you go along and figure it out. But that's nearly 20 years ago now. Follow the latest consumer news here Everyone lowered prices during the 2008 crash, but we put them up... The crash was really tough on many industries, but hospitality in particular is one of the first things that suffers when people don't have money. What we noticed was that everybody was doing cheap deals, two-for-ones, all this sort of thing was the rage at the time. But realistically, you don't travel into the middle of nowhere for a bargain. So we actually put our prices up and we tried to make it more of an experience rather than just doing what everyone else did. That's easier said than done when you've got no idea what you're doing as a 21-year-old, but I think it was a sound strategy. It is probably quite an interesting strategy for today's market as well. It can be a race to the bottom if you're not careful. I won a Michelin star when I was very young and didn't have it all figured out at all. I had huge imposter syndrome... I felt very insecure about my ability and very insecure about the sort of plaudits that were coming my way. You don't really learn anything from someone giving you a compliment, do you? You only learn from mistakes and from going through tough times. I journal every day and it's very rare that I write anything negative about the future... I was really poorly when I was 18. I got ulcerative colitis. My grandfather, whom I was very, very close to, died, and the stress of that caused my body to start eating itself. I was really poorly for about a year. I had a colostomy bag and was in and out of hospital, having three bouts of major surgery. I always wanted to try to turn a negative into a positive and that's certainly what gave me a quite insatiable drive for success. If I'd never been ill, I'd have just dossed around like any other lad my age, getting drunk, playing sport and doing all the other things that you want to do when you're that age. Cheap Eats: 'I'm a head chef - this is what you should tip and one thing I hate that some customers do' Cheap Eats: Top chef on spag bol hack, the Burger King item you can't beat, and two things customers should stop doing Cheap Eats: 'It's just bizarre' - top chef vents about two things customers do in 2025 In a lot of ways, COVID had quite a positive impact... because it definitely encouraged people to be way more creative with their outlooks and more entrepreneurial. I think people diversified their offerings and you see that from the number of people who added their businesses to things like Uber Eats, because they're looking at different ways of getting to the customer. The challenges are clear though... People don't have as much money to spend. There's a clear trend towards less drinking and earlier dining, especially. And it hasn't maybe affected us as much because of our location and what we do. But talking to more casual businesses, especially in London, the invention or the take-up of weight loss drugs has had a massive effect on that area of the market because people are literally eating less. Good for the customer, terrible for the operator... From a consumer point of view, the changes are really good because there's now a more diverse, better-quality hospitality industry. It's terrible for the operator, though, because the margins are tiny and people are going out of business. The biggest effects on the industry have been political choices... Increasing the minimum wage is a good thing for people who can have more money, but increasing the younger level of minimum wage decreases the job prospects of young people. Take the hike to employer national insurance - when you add in what is essentially a tax on jobs, you are going to see many redundancies. The national insurance increase, coupled with the living wage increase last year, added £250,000 to our wage bill. We just used to make really nice food but... the creative skill of the chef now is more how you create something that people really want to buy, but at the price point that they're willing to pay, while still having a margin. It's a nearly impossible thing. Most businesses are operating at break-even or below. Fish costs have gone up astronomically... One of my signature dishes is a turbot dish, which I did on Great British Menu many years ago. And when we had it on the menu in 2017, we would pay £18 a kilo for the whole fish. When I wanted to buy the turbot about a month ago, it was £86 a kilo. An operational change that I've made is going to sound really basic but... actually just better reporting, measuring everything. Every point of a percentage actually really matters in an industry that's operating at break-even.

What I would do, though, is give businesses 10% off the first 10% that they turn over and then businesses are incentivised to increase their turnover because they get a tax break. If you want to encourage growth, you would incentivise them financially? Why do they not do that? All they do is just tax us again. I was waiting for a train the other day at York Station and there was a little independent selling coffee... and they had a cheese and ham toastie for £7. I heard someone just be like, "£7 for a toastie?" I was like, "It's not seven quid though, is it?" Just take off the VAT as the starting point, and think about how much it costs to rent in the station. People don't consider the overheads and the costs of running something. Everything is so instant now... You can do everything on your phone, AI does half the stuff for us. But there's something old school about hospitality. Something about human interaction and breaking bread and spending that time together that just cannot be replaced with technology. And I think that's what still excites me. I just don't think it'll ever go out of fashion to spend time with loved ones and enjoy great hospitality and human interaction. Why can't we celebrate this? The most memorable customer I've had was a very famous American chef... called Thomas Keller, who has several three-Michelin-starred restaurants in America. And he came for dinner at the Black Swan. It was quite a few years ago now, but obviously everyone was so nervous. It was probably the most important chef in the world coming for dinner. He came in and the first thing he did is fist-bump everyone and ask if he could go into the kitchen. He asked "How you doing guys?" I just thought, "Wow, what a way to put everybody at ease." A behind-the-scenes moment from Great British Menu that viewers don't get to see is... how challenging it is to operate at that sort of level day after day, after day, after day, over a filming day that can be 14 or 15 hours. When your adrenaline is that high, it actually gets to the point where it's a real case of stamina. And I think sometimes people watch the show and go, "God, that person just fell apart when it came to the judges", and that might be because they're absolutely spent and exhausted. The standards have got higher and higher and higher every year on Great British Menu... One chef who probably stands out above all would be Spencer Metzger. He really nailed Great British Menu. People who do well practise and practise and practise and practise. One technique to make cheap products taste even better is... knowing how to use salt. It would make a massive difference to a lot of people's food. That sounds awful. A lot of people will cook without any salt and then add it at the end. But salt is a chemical you need to add throughout the cooking process. That's how you achieve the depth of flavour and an overall feeling of being seasoned. If you add salt at the end, food will taste bland and salty. Because you just taste the salt. There are quite a few cheat codes that work quite well... if I'm trying to cook quickly and cheaply, I will use things like Worcester sauce or Marmite, which are really umami, but they're really cheap. If I were trying to make something really quickly and not spend loads of money on expensive beef stock and things like that, a little spoonful of Marmite and a little bit of Worcester sauce would really increase the seasoning without really adding much cost to the dish. We spoke to Tommy Banks following the launch of his Classic British menu, available exclusively on Uber Eats this past December in London, Manchester, and Liverpool. The menu reimagined dishes from the last 400 years, celebrating tradition with a refreshingly contemporary touch.

Title: Dynamic pricing: Could it ever come to the supermarket aisle?

Louise Byrne Prime Time Dynamic pricing, where prices rise and fall in real time, has already reshaped how we book airline tickets and hotel rooms. Now, as digital price tags appear on supermarket shelves, some experts are asking whether grocery prices could ever follow a similar model. Next time you're at your local supermarket, take a closer look at the price tags - you might notice something new. Both Lidl and SuperValu have swapped their traditional printed labels for electronic shelf displays. The digital tags use e-ink, making them difficult to distinguish from paper, but the technology is completely different. So, if the era of printing individual price labels for every item in the store is a thing of the past, what does it mean for the consumer? The price tag was a revolutionary concept when it first appeared in the 1800s. Before its introduction, sellers could charge each customer a different price, making it difficult to shop around. With the arrival of price labels, everything changed. "In the new department stores everything had a price tag so everybody got charged the same amount. It was a friend of the consumer," Damian O’Reilly, Senior Lecturer in Retail Management at Technical University Dublin told Prime Time. But technology is beginning to change how prices are managed in shops. Electronic shelf labels Retail solutions company, Mercury Retail Services provides electronic shelf labels (ESLs) to a variety of different stores across the country. Managing Director Garry Doyle is predicting the technology will be in practically every shop over the next three to five years. Retailers, Mr Doyle says, benefit not only from savings on paper and labour but also from improved efficiency in stock management. Price changes can be made instantaneously using an online portal. The discreet, low-fi look of the digital displays means customers may not have spotted them, Mr Doyle said. "It’s a sign of a good piece of technology that embeds itself and isn’t noticeable to customers." But the rollout of digital price tags has raised broader questions about how such technology could be used in the future. When Kroger, one of the largest supermarket operators in the United States, began using electronic pricing in 2024, Senator Elizabeth Warren raised concerns that the move could lead to price gouging. Kroger denied the claims, saying it had no plans to implement a dynamic pricing model in its stores. In Ireland both SuperValu and Lidl told Prime Time they do not use their electronic price tags for dynamic pricing. Lidl said its prices were the lowest in the market, Supervalu’s operator Musgrave said its digital tags were for efficiency and sustainability. What is dynamic pricing? Dynamic or real-time pricing helps companies maximise revenue by adjusting prices to reflect how much customers are willing to pay. Prices can rise when demand is high and customers are prepared to pay more, and fall when demand is lower to encourage sales. Distinct from variable pricing such as a matinee at the theatre or happy hour at a bar or restaurant, dynamic pricing is where prices change frequently and rapidly, driven by computer processing. It’s common in airline tickets, hotels and in some jurisdictions on ride share or taxi apps like Uber. It isn’t defined under Irish or European law and, in most cases, not banned. But how likely is it that the same model will ever be introduced in supermarkets using ESLs? Recent academic research from the US found no evidence that digital price tags had led to real-time pricing spikes in supermarkets, even during periods of high inflation. The joint UC San Diego and University of Texas study, which was based on data provided by an unnamed major retailer, found that the pattern of prices looked almost exactly the same before and after the use of digital price labels. TU Dublin’s Damian O’Reilly points to the potential reputational damage if supermarkets were perceived to be price gouging. "Supermarkets work off very low margins and that they've got to be very conscious of what they're offering to the consumer to build up loyalty," Mr O’Reilly said. He maintains that retailers will focus on in-store strategies that encourage shoppers to buy additional, related products - turning one purchase into two. "What the supermarkets are looking for you to do is to buy more of their product and spend more in their supermarkets," Mr O’Reilly added. There’s an added complication that some larger supermarkets sell up to 20,000 products which makes implementing dynamic pricing very complex. "In other retailers I could see it happening but it’s very difficult in supermarkets with the amount of products and the price transparency that they have." Online retailers Supermarkets may be constrained by transparency, but online retailers operate under very different conditions. One of the world's largest retailers, Amazon reportedly changes prices 2.5 million times a day. Prime Time recently tracked a basket of 20 goods on Amazon.ie and found 79 price changes in just a month. Some items didn’t change at all, but others - like a box of baby wipes - shifted almost daily. Often the changes were only a few cents, but frequent enough that the cumulative effect was a shift of one or two euros over the course of a few days. In a statement to Prime Time, Amazon said: "We monitor and match publicly available prices of a wide selection of products from all product categories on Amazon.ie with those of other relevant retailers known to offer good value to customers. "In this way, we ensure that customers find equally low or even lower prices for a wide range of products sold and shipped through Amazon.ie." The statement also noted that many of the products on its site are sold by independent third-party sellers who set their own prices. Concert tickets Dynamic pricing made headlines in August 2024 when tickets for the Dublin leg of the Oasis reunion tour were sold using the model. Fans were reportedly charged different prices for seats in the same section of the stadium. A Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) investigation into the ticket sale is ongoing. It’s likely that the investigation will focus on the transparency and fairness given existing consumer law requires customers to be given enough detail to make an informed purchase. "I think consumers have been annoyed by it but it really is a supply and demand situation. The demand was so high for tickets," barrister Ronan Lupton, an experienced Senior Counsel practising in the areas of Commercial and Media Law, told Prime Time. "We don't have any evidence to suggest there was misbehaviour. It was simply that the only tickets that were available for selection at that stage were tickets that were of a particular price," Mr Lupton SC said. A Fianna Fáil bill to ban dynamic pricing by primary ticket sellers is on hold pending the Oasis case however Mr Lupton SC suggested that a complete ban may not be required. "We have laws to protect consumers and maybe we should look to upgrade and amend those laws rather than simply blanket prohibiting wholesale sellers from dynamic pricing," he added. The CCPC told Prime Time it couldn’t comment on the Oasis investigation as it is ongoing. Regarding supermarkets it noted that if grocery stores or other retailers introduce dynamic pricing existing consumer protection laws still apply. "Clear and transparent pricing is a cornerstone of consumer protection law and any pricing mechanism, whether static or dynamic, must comply with the law." Prices displayed have to be inclusive of all taxes and charges, and the price on the shelf must match the price the consumer is charged at the till, it said. A spokesperson for the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment told the programme that while dynamic pricing is currently permitted under consumer law it is "closely monitoring developments". "The outcome of the CCPC’s ongoing (ticket) investigation will be an important factor in determining whether further policy or legislative measures are necessary." There may also be changes ahead at a European level connected with the proposed Digital Fairness Act, which involved consultation on dynamic pricing. Proposals for new laws are expected during Ireland’s EU Presidency later this year. A report on this subject from Louise Byrne and producer/director Genevieve Brennan airs on the 6 January edition of Prime Time at 9.35pm on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player.

NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments. Managing money doesn’t have to be complicated or time consuming. Still, about a third of Americans (32%) feel anxious about their finances going into 2026, according to a new NerdWallet survey. You got this. If you focus on the little things and do them consistently, you’ll feel great about your financial life, says Lisa Eaton, accredited financial counselor and founder of Firm Footing Financial Planning in Seattle. We’ll make it easier and give you six ideas to help you think less about money in 2026, in 10 minutes or less. The problem with adulting is there are too many decisions to make in a day. Alleviate many of those about money by automating the no-brainer expenses. You might already have your mortgage or rent come out automatically, but what else can you set and forget? Eaton says automate as many fixed expenses as you can to save time, thought and reduce the risk of being late. Water, electricity, trash, cable and phone are all bills better paid on autopilot. The next time you sit down to pay these, select the automatic payment option. Use your bank’s “bill pay” feature to keep them all in one place. What about the bill to yourself? You won’t miss it if you make adding to your savings automatic. “This takes about 10 minutes, to set up a weekly or monthly transfer from checking to savings,” Robert Finley, a certified financial planner in Chicago, said in an email interview. The same NerdWallet study found that 46% of Americans want to save money for emergencies in 2026. Start with whatever you can spare. Make it $20, $50, $75 or whatever jibes with your budget right now. “Even small, consistent amounts add up, and once it’s automated, it’s completely hands off,” Finley said. As you build up your nest egg, a high-yield savings account is a good place to park some of your money. The best HYSAs usually offer an interest rate higher than traditional savings accounts. Find an institution you like and feel comfortable with, and consider opening an account. A balance of $10,000 could net you an extra $400 per year at an annual percentage yield of 4%, for example. If you have money you’d like to invest, you can keep fees down and your approach simple, says Eaton. “My baseline advice on investing is most people do really well with low-cost index funds,” she says. Index funds mirror the performance of a stock market index, such as the S&P 500. When you invest in index funds, you’re putting money into many companies, instead of buying stock in just one. To get started, Eaton suggests opening a brokerage account if you don’t have one. “Pick your first index fund and automate $10 a month from now until whenever.” All that paying yourself first may mean you need to find room in your budget. Are the Bluey episodes your kids have watched 16 times on Disney+ still worth the monthly price? Can you cancel Peacock, Paramount+ or Fox One after you’re done watching football? Eliminating one unused subscription is a good way to get an easy win, said Finley. “Review your credit card statement and identify one that’s no longer adding value,” he said. Then, cancel it. Try it for a couple months to see if you miss what you’re missing. If it feels good, cut your subs down to just one for music and another for TV. Eaton reminds us that these services “are designed to be flexible.” It’s not like walking out on the team in the middle of the season. “They’ll take you back.” One hot take to delete? DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, whatever app you use to order food. Not technically a subscription, but when a lunchtime delivery costs more than a month of Netflix Premium … maybe it’s time to make changes. Consider just deleting the app from your phone. Another 10-minute task: Find a few things around the house to sell, snap some photos and create listings on Facebook Marketplace. Has your Peloton bike mostly become a place to drape stuff? Are you over the antique armoire collecting dust in the corner? Post it for sale and see what happens. It’s quick to list, but can take a while to sell on Facebook. But when it goes, you’ll be happy to have it out and the few extra bucks in your Venmo account. We bet you’ll also get the bug to sell more stuff. You don’t have to go big or go home in 2026. Finley’s advice is to set one or two simple, but strategic, goals over the next 12 months. Actionable examples: The goals you set clarify your priorities, said Finley. With a plan in place, even a simple short-term goal, it’ll make it easier to keep doing the little things right. More From NerdWallet Tommy Tindall writes for NerdWallet.
