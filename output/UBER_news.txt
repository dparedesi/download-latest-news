Yves here. Get a cup of coffee. This is a meaty discussion of where we are and where we may be heading with our oligarchs’ schemes against the general public getting a ginormous boost from the Trump demolition project. If you don’t have the time to read this talk in full, do at least read Michael Hudson’s opening remarks. The fact that the plutocrats will wind up worse off, even if their relative advantage increases, seems not to have occurred to them. More and more severe contagions? Worse medical care, even at the top? Remember that the surgeon who operated on Ronald Reagan’s gunshot wound (after the hospital’s head surgeon was talked out of it) was the ER doctor who had the most experience in gun wounds….as in treating the riff raff who happened to shoot each other in weekend rows or gang dustups. Similarly, a doctor at one of the top West Coast hospitals told me that the dirty secret of concierge medicine was that those doctors were generally much less good (despite typically superb bedside manner) because their patients were on average much healthier than the population as a whole. That meant they got much less practice with cases that were hard to diagnose and/or treat. Originally published by the David Graeber Institute Nika Dubrovsky: Hi everyone. It’s a real honor to welcome you on behalf of the David Graeber Institute. We’re especially grateful to our speakers — many of whose work aligned closely with David’s thinking and values — for joining us to reflect on how radically our world is changing. It’s in this spirit that we hope to better understand the transformations unfolding around us. Today’s conversation marks the beginning of a new series of public discussions hosted by the David Graeber Institute. With that, I’m happy to hand over to Ann Pettifor, who will be moderating today’s session. Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Thank you very much, Nika. And can I say how wonderful it is for Michael and Yanis and myself to be gathering here in the name of our very dear friend David Graeber, whom we loved very much and were so sad at his loss. And thank you to Nika in particular for establishing the Institute and for facilitating these exchanges and reminding us all of how important David was to the current public debate. So I’m feeling quite emotional even thinking about him. So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So anyway, great. So I want to just begin. Everyone here knows Michael Hudson, I’m assuming, and Yanis Varoufakis. They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They will speak about their work. And what we have in common, I think, is A, David Graeber, but B, an understanding of the international financial system and its impact on Europe, on the United States and on the South. And that’s what is going to be the major theme of this today. And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I hope to begin with Michael Hudson’s latest paper, which is superb. And Michael, you give us the title because it’s escaped me for the minute. But it really is a wonderful paper, which I think Nika will be distributing more widely. So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So, Michael, you begin our conversation by talking to us about what is actually going on, really. What is the real motives of the Trump administration? And why are we where we are right now? Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Michael Hudson: Well, there are two things that are key in this. I think that a few years ago, Trump was talking to some economists, and he said, isn’t there some way that America can get rid of the income tax? We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%. And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the economists told him, well, you know, America didn’t really have an income tax until 1913. And Trump said, well, how did we get by from the revolution until World War I? And the economists said, well, we had tariff revenues. That was almost the entire source of the American government and the Treasury, along with the sale of land that had been grabbed from the Indians. And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And so Trump said tariffs. That’s wonderful. Trump loves tariffs because they fall mainly on the consumers, not his class. They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They don’t fall on the class that he wants to untax. So he somehow thought, how do we justify a tariff policy? And if only we can go back to that golden age, of course, we have to shrink government, at least the government social spending. And how do we justify a tariff policy? Well, I think that we’re now talking about him imposing tariffs to threaten other countries with destabilizing their economy. And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And that’s the only thing that America has to offer now. It can’t offer industrialization because it’s deindustrialized. It can’t really offer much financialization because it’s weaponized the dollar. Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump wants to weaponize foreign trade as well. And he’ll tell foreign countries, well, of course, we can roll back the tariffs and let’s sit down and negotiate. What can you give back to the United States? And it’s almost as if he’s read Yanis’s articles on the role of information technology is dominating the new economic shape of the world and that of empire builders. They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They want to gain dominance in information technology and various platforms and in ship making technology with a view to making other countries dependent on paying monopoly rents to U.S. companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, which are Trump’s large campaign contributors. So it’s as if information technology monopoly rents are going to be the new buttress of the American balance of payments. If other countries can be blocked from creating their own independent technology. Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Well, U.S. diplomats can impose sanctions on this. They can try to prevent China from developing IT. They can try to lock Europe and other countries into this. And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the magnitude of this issue today is as large as that of the 19th century fight against landlords. And it was the fight against landlords that inspired classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill to Marx and the socialists to define economic rent. And they said, if we’re going to free our economies from the legacy of feudalism, a hereditary aristocratic landlord class, then we’ve got to take away their economic rents, mainly by either taxing rents away or by just socializing the land and making it a public utility. So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So they developed the whole concept of economic rent as the excess of market price over intrinsic cost value. Well, they didn’t succeed in getting rid of the landlord class, but they did define rents in a way that can be applied to monopoly rents. Again, excessive price over income and that the fight against the kind of monopoly rents that Yanis has described as the ideal of the platforms of information technology and all of its associated dynamics are a parallel to the fight today to the 19th century fight against landlords. To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino To free economies from economic rent. And in this case, from economic rent that’s been sponsored and controlled by the United States as a means of replacing the form of dominance that it had over the rest of the world since 1945. Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Fantastic. That does lead us into Yanis’ book and Yanis’ work on technology. Yanis, what would you say to Michael’s analysis of what’s happening right now? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Well, of course, I agree. How can I not? Ever since he wrote the great book, Super Imperialism, and now he’s even alluding to my work on techno-feudalism. Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Look, it’s not technology. It’s got nothing to do with technology. I mean, technology is everything. Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Since the Iron Age, we’ve had technology. And it’s not information technology either. Because look, compare and contrast, for instance, OpenAI, which is, you know, heavy duty information technology, right? But in the end, it was so easy to append it. DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino DeepSeek came out and offered a cheap version of it and essentially damaged that business model spectacularly. So what I think Michael Hudson is very poignantly bringing into the conversation about the global order of things is what I call cloud capital. So you can have an industrial robot, which is very technologically advanced, uses information technology and algorithms and so on to assemble Teslas, right? You can have OpenAI, which produces a standard service in a standard capitalist model. But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But what lives in here? What lives in here? In Google? In Facebook? In Meta? In X? In all these platforms, this is not just information technology. We get it wrong. It’s a new form of capital. Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Because every form of capital we’ve had up until now, since we created the first tool to the old singing, old dancing industrial robots that assemble Teslas, they’ve been produced means of production. That’s what capital was. With this, we had a mutation of capital. For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino For the first time, we have automated systems that are not produced means of production, but are purely produced means of behavioral modification. So unlike the machines that Henry Ford employed to produce other machines, Model Ts, and create a monopoly capitalist system whereby he’ll use the monopoly profits in order to buy newspapers to influence people and governments and to rip up all the streetcars, trams, in order to replace them with his own cars. Unlike that, you know, Jeff Bezos doesn’t sell anything. I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I mean, he doesn’t sell anything he makes. His capital, his cloud capital has created a digital fiefdom in which he’s encased producers and consumers charging the equivalent of ground rent, of the feudal ground rent, which are called cloud rent. And today, most of the value in the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, it comes from cloud rent. It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It doesn’t come from capitalist profit. It’s exactly what Michael was saying. So when you saw this cabal of Bezos and Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Tim from Apple and all these nice boys around Trump during his inauguration, I would call it the coronation this time around. And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what you saw was these cloudalists, the owners of cloud capital, who some of them are losing a lot from the tariffs, like Elon Musk loses a lot from the tariffs. They don’t like the tariffs, but what they see in Trump is the gateway towards the complete political domination of this new form of capital, cloud capital. We all suffered for decades now, the neoliberalism. Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Friedman, Hayek’s return and domination of economics, as both of you and Michael know very well. For me, neoliberalism, I mean, methodologically, from an economic point of view, from a philosophical point of view, was completely bunk and not even interesting. What made it interesting was that it was the ideology which was necessary for the emancipation of financial capital after the end of Bretton Woods. To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino To unshackle the bankers from the shackles of the Bretton Woods system of the war economy, of the New Deal, they needed an ideology. And that was liberalism. Today, there is the unshackling of cloud capital. It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It was financial capital back then, now it’s cloud capital. And Trump is a vehicle for that. And we have to see, as Michael said, what he does, not just in terms of tariffs, maybe he’s got his own fixation that comes from the 19th century, McKinley and so on and all of that. But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But there is an interesting plan happening here. Essentially, his team, if you look at Stephen Miran and his famous paper, if you look at what Scott Bessett has been saying, they have a clear plan. Not so much Trump himself. Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump is very much influenced by the last person he speaks to, right? But his team. Don’t forget that Nixon changed the world, even though he wasn’t truly familiar with the Nixon shock. He didn’t have the depth of thinking of somebody like Paul Volcker, who was in the team with Henry Kissinger. These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino These people knew what they were doing. They were bringing in what Michael’s book refers to as Super Imperialism, what I much later described in my own Greek way as the global minotaur. The same story, right? It starts with Michael’s idea. These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino These people want, they’re really worried that the world of the dollar, the dollar universe, has become so large relative to the manufacturing sector of the United States, that they want to bring some manufacturing back to the United States in order to rebalance this ratio between the dollar sphere and the actual machine sphere. They are worried about the possibility that the dollar bubble will burst. I’m not saying that they are right to worry about this or not, but they are worried. And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And for them, what is going to give the next impetus, in the same way that in the 70s and 80s it was financial capital that gave the financialized world, whereby essentially the rest of the world was selling stuff to the United States, and also sending the dollars that they were getting paid with back to the United States in order to recycle them through Wall Street. Now it’s the rise of cloud capital. And the merge, the seamless merging of three things. Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Cloud capital, what lives in here, like Google and X and all that. Digital payment systems. Digital payment systems, like stable coins. This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino This goes hand in hand with the project of dividing the dollar without the yuan or the euro taking precedence. Because if you make the Japanese sell some of their 1.2 trillion dollars of savings and buy Tether, a US dollar linked crypto, you have increased the supply of dollars, you’ve brought the value of the dollar down, but that money goes into what? American long term debt. Because Tether, the company, if you give them more dollars for their Tether coins, they will invest in 30 year long US treasuries. So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So this is the plan. But the real driver of extractive power on behalf of the super ruling class of this super imperialist new vision by the Trumpists is cloud capital. And they will have a serious, serious, serious run for their money by the Chinese cloud capital, which is already seamlessly interwoven with Chinese finance and the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino That, I think, is the reason why the Trumpists began the new Cold War against China, because they see the clear and present danger from this merging of cloud capital and finance into what I call cloud finance. Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Wow, that’s fascinating. Thank you, Yanis, for that. Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Hang on a minute. I just want to say to the audience that Nika and I would like it very much if you posed questions and asked and comments about the talk, because we’re going to address those afterwards. And already, Paul Brandon has noted that much of tech today borrows land based metaphors, platforms, domain sites, even digital real estate. Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yet the economic consequences are rarely treated as land like, he says. Anyway, that’s one comment. And there are going to be others. So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So I want to make sure that we address those at the end. So please submit your questions. I just wanted to add one thing to the conversation and to what Michael has said, and that is that, yes, you know, the United States may be deindustrializing, but there is one thing that they now control and that is causing mayhem across the world. And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And that is the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the transition away from the US dollar as the world’s as the world’s reserve currency is going to be tumultuous, really. And the impact on the South is going to be devastating. And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the other thing that really worries me is the rise of bond deals in the United States, the rise of interest, because as Michael and I, when we first met, seems like 100 years ago, was to talk about the levels of global debt. And we know from the Institute of International Finance, that both private and public debt globally is something like three hundred and thirty three percent of global GDP. So that is particularly a burden for countries on the South. But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino But it’s the role of the dollar in the global economy and the fact that it’s weakening right now, the implications of that for debt repayments in dollars, for example. But for the transition away from that without anyone offering an alternative plan. And I keep wanting to talk about the International Clearing Union as proposed by Keynes as an answer to the question of the reserve currency. And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And in particular, to talk about regional clearing unions, in particular for Africa and African Payments Union, which will enable Africa to decouple from the dollar and trade with its partners and allies on the continent. Anyway, I want us to bring the dollar into the discussion as well and very much welcome your comments, Michael, as well as yours, Yanis. Michael Hudson: Well, I think what all three of us have talked about is, of course, the point that Yanis pointed out, that finance is the mother of monopolies. And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And indeed, the financial sector has not only been I’m sorry, the IT sector has not only been sponsored by the financial sector as it’s been financialized, but the entire economy has turned away really from what began, you could say, as profit seeking to rent seeking. And Yanis makes the point that Meta and the others certainly began as capital, but capital makes profits. And what these sectors want is much more than profits. They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino They want economic rent. They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was. And I think Yanis pointed out, most of the financial sector credit is for real estate. And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what the financial sector wants is not only real estate land rent, but as it loads down real estate with larger and larger loans relative to the value of and the purchase price of the homes and the office building that it’s making, it is into capital gains. And the same thing with the economic rent that’s extracted by Meta and the other IT platforms. The financial sector wants to use this dominance to create economic rents that will have an increasing financial value, which is why Nvidia and Google and Amazon and Apple have all been really the drivers of the U.S. stock market in the last few years. So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So you have a symbiosis between economic rent seeking, finance, and any kind of opportunity that the financial sector and the IT sector and the real estate sector can impose an access price on users that is very much like landlords controlling the rents that have gone up and up and up as home ownership in the United States is plunged by about 10 percentage points since the Obama bailout of the financial sector after 2009. So you’re having a transformation of the economy away from the textbook idea of companies making profits to companies making rent to the entire U.S. economy, thinking, how can we use this rent seeking to achieve U.S. dominance over the rest of the world. Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: And Michael, can I say this? You know, I think that’s absolutely right. But what we have is, if you like, the creation of credit relative to finite assets, assets that are, as you say, declining in value and that are finite. And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I want us all, Yanis and you, Michael, to think about these in relation to the climate as well and to the biosphere. Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Before the climate, I need to answer your question about the dollar. Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Anyway, I just want to say, Michael, are you still with us? You are somewhere there. Yanis, why didn’t you respond to that? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Well, first on the dollar, and then I’ll talk to you about the climate. You won’t like what I have to say about the climate and the state of our world. I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I don’t like it either, but I have to be honest with you in answering it. Okay, let’s start from the question of the dollar. It is the end game. American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino American hegemony depends on the exorbitant privilege of the United States, still to this day. Now, I think it is a mistake to assume that the dollar is waning as we speak. I don’t believe it is waning. We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing.

Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned.

And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped?

And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino We would like to see it wane. I would like to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar go. I would like to see a multipolar world with different currencies competing with, as you said, along the lines of the ideas of Keynes in 1944 and so on, but I don’t see it yet. It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies.

And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It may well happen. This is an opportunity for it to happen, but let’s not take it for granted. Let’s not forget that the Nixon shock was utterly successful in doing two things at once: Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944.

But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Reducing the value of the dollar, increasing bonds, bond yields at the same time, and seriously enhancing the dominance of the U.S. dollar. The dollar was devalued and enhanced simultaneously. That is what the Trump administration wants to do, and we should not take it for granted that they shall fail. I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work.

The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II.

You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino I want to see them fail, but let’s not take it for granted. What it will depend on is on whether they succeed in getting holders of dollars to sell them, but at the same time not to purchase other currencies that will then essentially become competitors to the reserve currency status of the dollar. Now, you mentioned the International Clearing Union, the brilliant idea which was rejected so scathingly by Harry Dexter White in 1944. Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe.

I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated.

You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Now, look, I don’t believe that the African Union can do that, simply because the African Union, as long as it continues to rely on to run a massive trade surplus with China, with other countries, such an ICU cannot work. But where the ICU idea could work is if China decides to internationalize the yuan and to turn the BRICS area, not into a common currency area, but in a Bretton Woods-like system with the yuan playing the dollar in the BRICS area that the dollar played in the Bretton Woods system. In other words, the United States was the surplus country in the Bretton Woods system, and it was recycling its surpluses in the form of direct injections either through aid or through loans to the rest of the Bretton Woods area. China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years.

And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe.

When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino China can do that. It can do that within the BRICS area. And that is very different from the BRICS pay, which is now simply an alternative to SWIFT. But to do that, they will have to decide to take on the exorbitant power of the dollar. And at the moment, and I think the Trump people know that, I don’t know whether Trump knows it, but the Trump people surrounding him know that, the greatest ally of the exorbitant privilege of the United States dollar is China, is the Beijing government, because they have not decided yet. They may decide it soon, but they have not decided yet to compete for reserve currency status with the United States. If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino If you are a Chinese capitalist in Shenzhen and you’re exporting aluminum to the United States, you don’t want to see the exorbitant privilege of the dollar wane, because the dollar is a kind of IOU that you’re receiving from California. And then you take this money and you take it back to New York and you buy real estate in Miami. Ann Pettifor: No, no, no, no, you don’t. You buy financial assets. You don’t buy real estate. You buy financial assets and then buy real estate. Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II.

How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Increasingly, they buy real estate, because they don’t trust the financial assets as they used to. But anyway, the point is this. The point is that the Chinese Communist Party has not decided yet to pull the plug, to go for a Bretton Woods ICU version of the Bretton Woods within BRICS. Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this?

When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Some of us are working towards convincing them to do it, because that will be of great benefit to the global South. Ann Pettifor: But, Yanis, does that mean you are proposing that what should happen is an alternative hegemonic currency? Why, I mean, why should we? Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: Not at all, Anne. I mean, the reason why you and I love the Keynes idea of the ICU is that it is exactly the opposite of a hegemonic currency. The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971.

The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent.

And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino The whole point of the ICU is no hegemonic currency. You have the banker. You have a common accounting unit. And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now.

I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And you have simultaneously, you put levies symmetrically on surpluses and deficits in order not to have a hegemon. So this is what I’m proposing that the BRICS should aim at. Not another hegemonic based on China system, but a non-hegemonic multipolar world without the United States and Europe in it. Because the United States doesn’t want to, and Europe is too stupid to understand that it needs it. Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive.

Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Michael Hudson: Well, in order to achieve this independence, you have to deal with the problem of the enormous dollar-denominated debt that the Global South countries and other countries have accumulated since World War II. Well, Trump has just given a wonderful excuse for breaking away from this dollar debt, because other countries have said, with the tariffs that Trump has imposed, it makes it impossible for Global South countries, which are the most highly taxed under Trump’s threat, to obtain the dollars to pay their dollar debt. So Trump has turned this dollar debt into odious debt, debt that can’t be paid. And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And indeed, that buildup of debt was the whole objective of the U.S. alternative to the Keynesian proposals for how the post-war 1944-1945 world was going to work. And the key, in addition to suspending or moratorium on the Global South’s dollar debt, it cannot invest in its own economic infrastructure and advancement and at the same time pay the dollar debt. That’s what makes it odious. Well, the key to what Keynes proposed as an alternative to Bretton Woods was the fact, the intergovernmental character of this debt, that we’re not talking about a BRICS currency as such, and you really can’t have a BRICS currency without a political union of everybody deciding who gets what from this. But what you can get is an intergovernmental currency, like the Bancor that Keynes said, that would govern the debts between the surplus countries. In this case, it will probably be China and a few other oil-producing countries and the deficit countries. And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And what Keynes said was, if you have one country achieving dominance and chronic surplus under the international trade payments and investment relations, then at a certain point the surplus that’s accumulated will have been deemed exploitative. We’ll write that down and the countries that have become dependent, the Global South countries, will have their debts erased. Well, Keynes had in mind the US dollar and England at that time, obviously. He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino He thought that the United States aimed at creating a post-war order in 1945 that would take control of the British Empire, ending British imperial preference, making a British loan that prevented Britain from devaluing overvalued sterling until about 1949. All of this structuring of an international market was an artificially created, politically-run, American-dominated market. And Keynes’ plan for the Bancor would be to wipe out the enormous dollar debt that had been accumulated at the expense of other countries, liberating other countries from this dependency relation that the combination of the IMF and its awful, destructive austerity plans, anti-labor plans that it’s imposed, and the World Bank that has blocked other countries from creating their own domestic food independence from the United States, to force them into plantation exports and to oppose land reform and oppose any investment in domestic food independence so that the United States could its food exports, the buttress of its trade balance like oil, and giving it the ability to turn off the food spigot and starve other countries as it tried to starve China right after Mao’s revolution. These are the preconditions for how you break free of the dollar area, and de-dollarization has to impose a debt write-down of the dollar debt, I think. Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: So we agree on most of this then, but what I’m puzzled about, Yanis, was your comment about the dollar not weakening, because there are clear signs already of money leaving, of dollars leaving the United States, mainly because of the lack of confidence in the way in which tariff policy is being mismanaged. So, I mean, I see it happening and I see a general disillusion and fear of the dollar, the fear of the United States, because it’s destabilizing. No? Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies.

I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think we should confuse the drop in the exchange value, the exchange rate of the dollar, with a weakening of the dollar as the reserve currency. This is exactly what happened after 1971. You had a massive devaluation of the dollar, and yet its hegemonic position was enhanced. It may very well happen again, may very well happen again. I see no evidence. Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Look, if you want to see an example of a loss of, a tiny loss of hegemonic power by the dollar, I think a better example is the war in Ukraine. The moment the Europeans and the Americans confiscated hundreds of billions of Russian central bank monies, dollars, I’m not judging it, whether they should have done it or not. Matter of factly, I’m saying the moment they did that, there was an immediate increase in the amount of money that especially Saudis and Emiratis and Indonesian capitalists and landlords from Malaysia and so on started funneling through the Chinese digital currency system, because they were scared of confiscation, right? Not tariffs. Tariffs they don’t care about. Confiscation they care about. So if anything, if there was a blow at the hegemonic position of the dollar, it was a Ukraine war. It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this?

And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino It was not what Trump is doing. Now, of course, we’ll have to wait. Look, Ann, if you put it in terms of the timeline of the 1971 Nixon shock, which started on the 15th of August 1971, as we know very well, today we’re somewhere around October 1971. The dust has not settled. It is very possible, especially when the tax cuts come in, because he, you know, remember Trump has two weapons or two bullet cartridges in his shotgun. One was a tariff. The other one was those obscene tax cuts for the ultra rich. I bet you when that happened, there was going to be an influx of capital into the United States. So don’t count our chickens or the dollar’s chickens yet. Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness.

Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: Right. Okay. I take that point. Yanis Varoufakis: I haven’t asked you a question about climate. Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest.

If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettiffor: But tell me what you think, Yannis, is Europe’s role in all of this? You know, what is Europe? Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side.

And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Yanis Varoufakis: We’re the stupid continent. We’re the stupid continent. Look at our leaders. They’re running around like decapitated chickens. They are fighting with one another. There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on.

So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino There is no plan. Nobody’s having the conversation you should be having in Europe. One conversation is the conversation of how do you boost investment to boost aggregate demand so you don’t need to rely on exporting deflationary forces to the United States by means of the 240 billion of net exports every year to the United States. Nobody’s having this conversation. They are arguing with one another as to whether they will convince Trump to take things back through cajoling him, kissing his ass, as he said, in very scientific terms, or begging him. This is the difference between France this morning. Macron and Merz had an almighty fight. Macron was saying, oh, we have to tax services, digital services. I’m all in favor of cloud taxes, right? But if they think they will defeat Trump’s tariffs through that, they are more idiotic than I thought they were. And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And then Merz says, oh, no, no, we need a trade deal. If we need to eat lots of chlorinated chicken, let’s do it because that’s the way to get on the right side. So Europe, 30 years ago, I was talking about the need to have 5% of aggregate investment, an aggregate investment vehicle in the euro area, which was being put together back then. And that was rejected. Then when I was in the finance minister’s council in Europe, I proposed 5%, and I proposed exactly how it should be done, through a net issue of EIB bonds, European Investment Bank bonds, with the support of the European Central Bank. It was rejected by Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Mario Draghi comes last year out and says, we need 5% of investment. These people, when they leave office, they have the right ideas, only because they know that they cannot be implemented. Now, we’re not having this conversation. Instead, the only conversation they’re having is what? Because for 15 years, the combination of austerity for the many, and money printing for the very, very few, has produced an investment strike. There’s been no investment, zero net investment in Germany for 15 years. So the result is Volkswagen cars cannot be sold. Nobody wants to buy them. So what they’re doing is they’re retiring production lines of the Volkswagen, and they’re making us buy tanks that Rheinmetall would be making on those production lines. Tanks we neither need nor want. And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption.

So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And as if the European Union can emulate the American military industrial complex, as if we can start a new war every year or two, which we cannot do. So Europe is a stupid continent. I’m saying this with a lot of pain as a committed Europeanist, and very patriotic about Greece, about Europe, but we are going to go down in history as the most idiotic cabal of politicians and economists in the history of the world. Why? Because we’re not like Africa. We don’t lack resources. We don’t lack wealth. We don’t lack technology. We don’t lack the great universities. What we lack is a political system that can organize the escape out of a brown paper bag. Ann Pettifor: I think we get your point, Yanis, about Europe. But Michael, tell me, what role for China now? How is China going to handle this? I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape.

I’m conscious we’ve not got a lot of time to talk about this, but Michael, what are your views on China’s role in all this? Michael Hudson: Well, I’m surprised at how passive China has been all of this. And Yanis has said, what is their plan? Well, finally, they’ve taken the gloves off and said, well, now that the United States has offshored its industry and its dependency on China for refining vital raw materials, not only the rare earths, but even aluminum and other products, China has the ability to turn Trump’s tariff policy and U.S. economic policy against itself by isolating itself. Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye.

After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Trump has set out with the American sanctions to isolate China, Russia, and the rest of the world, but he’s overplayed his hand so much that he’s left the United States isolated. And that creates a free reign for other countries, essentially the global majority countries, to create an alternative to the dollar. Well, I think one of the things that Trump has tried to do with the tariffs and demanding givebacks from other countries, he wants to make the European idiocy, for instance, that Yanis has talked about, an official aim of American tariff policy by saying, well, one of your givebacks is you have to create a political system that is dominated not only by pro-U.S. politicians, but dominated by a right-wing, anti-labor, pro-Rentier, anti-government free market policy that defines a free market as something that the United States has created and shaped in its own self-interest. So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of a market are they going to create? To me, the essence of this alternative market would be to do what the 19th century classical economists wanted to do. You want to free that market from exploitation, especially exploitation in the form of economic rent, not only land rent, but monopoly rent, and especially financial rent. China has made money creation and banking a public utility. That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek.

Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino That is its great advantage, and that’s what’s enabled it to avoid the financialization of industry that has been responsible for de-industrializing the United States and the European economies. So that’s a precondition. But China hasn’t followed through with the logic of 19th century free market economies to want to free its own economy from land rent and from the mortgage debt that’s developed into its own economy and sort of paralyzed the financial sector for the last few years. And one of the problems is China hasn’t really federalized its economy. In the late 1970s, when Milton Friedman came there with a hundred flowers bloom, China said, okay, we’re going to let a hundred flowers bloom. And it left local localities, towns and entire cities to depend on their own revenue to develop. Well, how did they achieve this revenue from an economy that didn’t have a tax base? They began selling off the land or leasing the land to real estate developers. And that leasing led to a kind of symbiosis of finance with the real estate sector, finance, insurance and real estate, the fire sector. China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now?

Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino China has let this sector develop. And if it’s going to create a model that’s an alternative to the U.S. financialization model, it has to go back to looking at tackling the problem of economic rent. And that entails freeing its localities from dependence on privatizing and financializing its real estate as a means of financing their fiscal policy. I’ve not had very much success in China. And I’m trying to remind them that when they claim to be Marxist, they have to follow volume two and three of capital and theories of surplus value also, and realize that it’s all about economic rent seeking and land rent, especially as part of the socialist reform. So I think they’re operating partially in the dark as to what to do. And they really don’t know, haven’t set aside as America is threatening China and Iran with its military attack on Ukraine and on Russia. This is the wildcard, as you pointed out. Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped?

Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: So can we just for a moment address the whole question of the biosphere? And to come back to your point about cloud capital, which I think is very powerful, Yanis, how far can these guys go in extracting rent without also just extracting the finite assets that make up the biosphere? And there’s got to be a limit to the extent to, because ultimately that rent must depend on something real. It cannot only depend on synthetic assets. It has to also depend on real assets. And how far can they go before they blow up the ecosystem? My goodness. Yanis Varoufakis: And look, back in 2015, 2016, before Trump was elected first time around, I was particularly concerned that maybe humanity has gone past the point of no return in terms of climate catastrophe. That was in 2016. After that, we had two terms of, well, we’re in the second term of Trump and one term of Biden who waxed lyrical about the green transition, but essentially did nothing towards that except some tax credits for some green stuff along the massive subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. So if I was worried back then, you know, 10 years ago about us going past the point of no return, imagine how terrified I am now. And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped?

And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I see no evidence that we are doing anything to stop that from becoming our reality. Now, look, it’s a tale of two cities, cloud capital. Compare and contrast OpenAI with DeepSeek. OpenAI, which is based on the pure rent extraction model that, you know, Michael was talking about as well, cloud to rent extraction. They are in the business of throwing as much computing power into the AI machine as possible, hoping that data will come in on one side and the output will be intelligence. That will never happen. But anyway, this is an extremely energy intensive process because it is accumulative. DeepSeek, on the other hand, they use smart software engineering in order to produce even better results from their AI using a tiny, tiny proportion of the energy. Okay, but what is the main, why can DeepSeek do it? Because they’re not extracting any rents out of it. They have provided us with that service for free as a social gift, right? So ownership and rent seeking is at the heart of the connection between cloud capital and the impact on the environment. Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics.

Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees. This is a beautiful world powered by cloud capital as long as it is socially owned. Ann Pettifor: Right. So you are in agreement and you do like what they’re doing, which is fantastic. While we’re at this stage of the conversation, can I just bring in our dear friend David Graeber and the role of the state in all of this? As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Ann Pettifor: That’s really interesting. I don’t know if you know, we had a catastrophe at Heathrow Airport recently when the local energy substation collapsed. Apparently, the energy generated for the whole of Heathrow is a third of what is needed for a similar substation, not far away, just for generating data processing. So it is burning up huge quantities of energy. So, and making that link, of course, with economic rent is right. Now, Yannis, there is a question for you that I don’t fully understand and I hope you can answer. Do you know the copyleft and the free software movement are behind you? Will you work with the EFF, I’m not sure who they are, to start a mass movement to change the property rights of the cloud infrastructure? Yanis Varoufakis: Well, I’m always glad to have people behind or with me or alongside or just in front of me, even better so I can follow them. Look, it is true that some of us have been working very hard to free up software, to socialise cloud capital, to start imagining how beautiful cloud capital would be if it is socially owned. Let me give you a simple example. Why do we need Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, and even our banks, private banks, payment apps? Imagine if you’re a municipality, and it’s really that easy to get coders to code their own municipal, original, publicly owned cloud capital. So that I’m here and I want to go to the airport and instead of getting Uber that will always try to maximise the cloud rents of the owners of Uber that will end up in the Cayman Islands, it belongs to the municipality. And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport.

As you know, David was essentially an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period? And can I say why we’ve only got a few minutes left, but I’m deeply pessimistic about this transition. When we’ve had these tensions in the past, they haven’t led to peace and prosperity, but to the reverse. So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies. Debt has become a stranglehold and the debt in conjunction with being run up to finance economic rent is a two-pronged stranglehold. And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And I can say, look, my name is Yanis and I want to go to the airport. What do you recommend? And one recommendation is a local taxi that retains all the rents from taking me to the airport. Or the attendant says, don’t be so stupid. There is a metro bus that is much faster or it costs almost nothing. Take that. Uber will never do that. What about Airbnb? Why can’t our municipality decide on the democratic principles what percentage of our housing we want to rent out for how many days a year instead of effectively pushing everything into the tourist section and where Airbnb is lapped? Decide this democratically and run a socially responsible Airbnb. What about food delivery? What about payments? We can have the very same principles that govern the digital currency of the Central Bank of China. Imagine if we had payment systems which allowed us even to store our money and to receive the overnight interest rate of the Central Bank for zero fees.

And this is what classical economics is all about, is a logical extension of land rent by what Europe and the West inherited from feudalism, not only a landed aristocracy, but the usury oriented banks not making, creating credit for industrialization and industrial investment, but for real estate monopolies to control. And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right. Well, I think we’ve tackled the big subjects here of the day. Have we said enough about the climate? I worry that for many low-income countries being flooded and suffering from droughts when they are often, you know, producers of commodities and need to be able to produce those commodities to deal with, to actually survive, that actually we haven’t yet, the low-income countries haven’t yet come into focus in this crisis. Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino So I worry about that and then I worry about the role. What do we expect as socialists, as people who want socially owned institutions? What do we think about the role of the state? Michael. Michael Hudson: Can you rephrase the question? Ann Pettifor: In the context of David Graeber’s ideas about how… Michael Hudson: Well, David and I spent… The whole focus of what we were doing was a debt cancellation and the fact that the world is so heavily burdened by debt service, that their debt service has crowded out the money, the income needed for new investment, whether it’s infrastructure or private investment, and it’s crowded out personal consumption. And without a writing down of debt, you cannot go forward. Each recovery since World War II has been on a higher and higher debt level. And the debt is so high that it’s stifling economies. Well, what we’ve been talking about earlier today in this show is here we have a perfect example of how to at least free the global South countries and many global majority countries from their debt overhead because of Trump’s tariff policy as announced so far this may enlist countries agree to a give back in the form of abolishing democratic policy and putting forth a right-wing anti-government policy of free markets defined as those controlled by the financial sector and the monopolies that the financial sector controls in order to have a stranglehold over economies.

Entirely, the West is entirely the focus of these discussions around the Trump shock. And I want us to be thinking about both the climate impact, but also the economic impact of what’s going on. And I know that’s something that Nika is also particularly concerned about in low-income countries. Now, of course, it’s largely debt, but it’s largely also toxic emissions from the North, poisoning, if you like, the planet and making it so much harder for people in low-income countries to survive. We’re pretty much at the end of this conversation. I’d just like to say what an honour it has been to discuss with my comrades, Yanis and Michael, and to thank Nika once again for organising this and to all of those listening. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did. Thank you. Yanis Varoufakis: Goodbye. Thank you, Ann, for organising this. And thank you, Nika, for running the Institute. And thank you to Michael for sharing your platform. Michael Hudson: Well, we’ve tried to redefine the whole terms of the debate. Ann Pettifor: Absolutely. Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino And the very idea of monopoly rent, so land rent, monopoly rent and financial rent were the aims of classical free market economics. And I think David and I focused upon the role of debt cancellations is the key of this because it’s finance that has backed this rent seeking all the way from real estate rent to monopoly rent, to the privileges of the financial banking system and taking control of government. That’s the role of central banks to take control of government policy. Ann Pettifor: Sure. And what’s your view, Yanis, about the role of the states in this transition and what’s coming now? Yanis Varoufakis: I think that Michael will appreciate when I start my answer by mentioning that when I resigned to the finance ministry, my major clash with the prime minister who had just accepted the perpetration of our debt bondage and that thus led me to resign, he turned around and said to one of his colleagues, explaining why our ways had to part, Yanis, has this fixation with debt cancellation for which I said, yes, in the same way that if I were a prisoner of war, I would have a fixation with escape. So I think Michael understands that, right? Now, regarding the question about the state and the role of the state. Look, we live in a world, in a socioeconomic mode of production, distribution, exchange, and so on, which is founded at the ideological level on a major motivated error. And it is that we produce value privately. That is the error. The ideology that we produce value privately and then the state comes and collectivizes it through the tax system. When in reality, we produce value collectively and then those with the power, either the market power or the state bureaucratic power come in and privatize it, right? So if we’re going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively. Yeah. Ann Pettifor: I mean, that’s my view. And this is why I look always to Roosevelt for all his weaknesses, and they were many. He was able to defy Wall Street and he was able to make Wall Street pay the costs of the depression, if you like, by removing the power over the dollar and effectively over interest rates from Wall Street and taking that back to the treasury. So for me, he is the model. I mean, he was the one courageous leader that was happy for Wall Street to hate him. And he welcomed his hatred as is known for one of his great speeches. Right.

Goodbye. Transcription: Juan Sanguino Thanks, brilliant post! I love a good modern day take on rentierism. My (old school Scottish National Party) Director of Studies at my Cambridge college spent 55 minutes of a supervision teaching us the university mandated nonsense. Then he’d tell us “this is NOT for the economics exam. It’s how things really work”. He’d then take 5 minutes to explain how Smith hated the rentiers, how Henry George made the same case but from the progressive end of the political spectrum etc. Unfortunately it took me years to fully accept all that. But I got there in the end and also got into MMT and its associated stuff. “They want to turn what began as an industrial sector in information technology into the kind of rent seeking that land was.” Cory Doctorow, the early years, talked about this and about the great weakness of Intellectual Property which is that the concept seeks to own an idea, a thought. And so while Louis B. Mayer could boast that the movie business allows you to sell something while still owning it–charge a rent–the move to digital meant that movies were no longer two mile long strips of celluloid but a collection of pixels that could fit on a thumb drive. The “ownership” side of the great scheme was suddenly in peril. So that’s a new wrinkle to our new age where physical things are replaced by digital things. And just as the movie industry is now going down the tubes the useless eaters around Trump and the man himself are fighting a rear guard action against countries that actually make things while we, as Larry Summers said, give them pieces of paper. Money too has become an idea of power without even a physical token. Trump just got rid of the penny. The rest to follow? Haven’t yet the time to read the entire post, but if we are talking paradigm shifts, I could offer a couple of obvious ones; Millions and billions of people working COLLECTIVELY, then having to save individually is one of the greatest scams in history. As people are linear, goal oriented creatures in this cyclical, circular, reciprocal, feedback generated reality, we see money as signal to save and store, while markets need it to circulate. Consequently Econ 101 considers it both medium of exchange and store of value. These are not synonymous. In your body blood is the medium, fat is the store. Mix them up and see how long you live. Roads are a medium, parking lots are a store. If we treated roads like we treat money, everything would be paved over, but we would still be fighting over the lots. As a medium, you own money like you own the section of road you are on, or the air and water flowing through your body. Given it is a social contract, not a commodity, storing the asset side of the ledger requires a debt on the other side. So much of our economic activity is primarily designed around generating debt in order to store the illusion of wealth. As states function as super organisms, government forms as the nervous system, while money and banking approximate blood and the circulation system. We have evolved enough to understand that as the purpose of government is the health of the entire society and not just the accumulation of power by those at the top, it qualifies as a public utility. We have yet to understand the same principle applies to banking. Consequently the banks are having their let them eat cake moment. “Roads are a medium, parking lots are a store. If we treated roads like we treat money, everything would be paved over, but we would still be fighting over the lots.” More like all roads would be toll roads. When that federal bankruptcy occurs, Blackrock will own I-70 and it will be a toll road. It’s called “disaster capitalism” when the bankers do it to other countries. …dirty secret of concierge medicine was that those doctors were generally much less good (despite typically superb bedside manner) because their patients were on average much healthier than the population as a whole. I’ve always wondered about this, or if they were burnouts or recovered addicts, but the only people I know who have access to concierge doctors are their clients. But why would our betters think any negative effects of anything would enter their bubble? They can just drink raw milk and avoid tap water. The looming botox shortage might be a bit of a hiccup, requiring the inconvenience of a quick holiday in Ireland. The medics in my family have been telling me this for several decades. If you are sick, the best place to go is a big public teaching hospital, the stats are very clear on this. There are a number of reasons – one is that the doctors in private clinics and hospitals don’t get the throughput and variety of patients to build up their skills fully. They also don’t have the benefit of daily rubbing shoulders with other specialists and picking up informal information. Another is possibly that there is an element of overspecialization in profitable procedures. Another key issue is that small hospitals don’t have the range of expertise to hand if something unexpected happens (e.g. you go in for a procedure, and they discover something unexpected outside the expertise of the hospital). Its not a particularly well kept secret that many private hospitals will put you in an ambulance to the nearest big public hospital if something is going wrong. Thanks. Another warning concerns psychiatrists. It may be a joke or stereotype but it is rooted in a crumb of truth: many are themselves “nuts”. I recognised projection in my first regular shrink in UK. He is gone and hasn’t returned. The other one gave off weird vibes to me and someone else…… he now seems much more grounded and was courageous enough to admit that the antidepressant cocktail he pushed (unsuccessfully) on me in 2015 went nowhere. Kudos. He’s really standing up for me in fights with local funders to get me the meds I need easily. I’ve a friend doing a psychology undergrad. She opined to me recently that at least 60% of her class seemed to have some sort of personality disorder or mental issue. And as for the lecturers… As an anecdote about private hospitals, a few years ago a retired cousin who spent her entire career as a senior nurse in NY came down with a particularly dangerous cancer (thankfully, she survived). As she had lots of medical contacts and good insurance she was directed to the foremost private hospital in NY for cancer treatment. They refused her – she guessed the reason was that they thought she would negatively affect their stats. My 2nd PhD student did thesis on mental health. Though I was not the clinical co-supervisor I did sit in on one or two focus groups. I tried to non verbally warn her not to reveal her own history when a client asked but she went right ahead. In the end no harm and it arguably got more out of the clients. But I’m hyper aware of the mental state of anyone I encounter working in mental health. And yeah health economics 101 is case-mix and playing the system. I must have missed this one, thank you for posting. In addition to all the great points raised, it is still a question for me of how stable “cloud capital”, crypto and all electronic tech will be in a context of unstable, and/or crumbling electrical infrastructure? (in the US, at least). All of these systems are 100% dependent on a safe (and cheap?) stable supply of huge amounts of electricity (energy). On that level, nothing has changed because, like traditional industrial production, tech systems rely on huge amounts of energy. If/when a serious crisis comes, how can one access the cloud data? how can one access the crypto etc.? And the old questions are who will control the flow of energy to power all this? Or local nuclear power? (leaving out environmental destruction and climate issues) All these techno feudalists are going to be very very sad when an EMP makes their Kingdom suddenly unfunctional To be honest I’ve been thinking for a while now that major powers (if they have even half a brain) will be working on a directional EMP to instantly bring down an enemy. Particularly if that enemy no longer has the manufacturing capability to replace loads of fried transformers. Michael: “So the question for China and the global majority countries will be, what kind of market are they going to create?…you want to free the market from exploitation…especially in the form of economic rent…” Ann: “As you know David was an anarchist in the true sense of the word. What do we think the role of the state ought to be in this period?” I’m extremely pessimistic about this transition.” Yanis: “So if we are going to use the state, it should be to diffuse power in order to make sure that value that is produced collectively is enjoyed collectively.” For me, it”s not clear from this discussion where the progressive left and the MMT left stand on the issue of the decentralization of power and the role of the State. What is the future economic/political architecture being alluded to? Most MMTrs are hesitant to talk about ancillary political issues, so as not to invite dissension from the main points that they are making. The fact is that MMT can be consonant with policies from left to right (e.g., Cheney and Bush Jr. saying that deficits don’t matter). So MMT wasn’t the topic here EXCEPT regarding China’s keeping money as a public utility — in the Treasury (Bank of China), not a “central bank” like the Fed serving the commercial banking interests. Thus the problem with dollar domination seems to be that there is an entrenched oligarchy all over the place that is very very comfortable with using USD, because USA IS par excellence, the protector and defender of the oligarchic system and oligarchs, in most of the countries do control the levers of political power. With China, as it was with Russia, things will be sorted out when overt or covert attacks on China will be launched by the USA. So it has to get worse before there is a chance in hell to get better. Increase impacts of climate change will also help in their twisted ways… Ann Pettifor: Yes, let’s get there. But let’s not forget, because we always do the role of the biosphere in all of this, how much more extraction and exploitation are these guys capable of before we, you know, collapse the whole ecosystem? Unfortunately, in many economic discussions, climate change is the elephant in the room, and gets rather short shrift, if any mention at all. While climate distortations may effect the poorest countries first, and undoubtedly there will be massive migrations away from places where there is flooding by saltwater into agricultural land, or conversely, devastating droughts, ultimately those people will seek other places to survive. In short, if migration now into the U.S. and Europe is a social challenge, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Imagine regional wars breaking out over resources, land, etc., and we may be plodding our way into WW III. And the other issue that gets little attention is the idea that even with the best efforts, there may not exist, as authors like Richard Heinberg discuss, enough basic resources remaining for us to be able to have a sustainable world. Here, a rational population policy might be a good place to start. And so, unless we address this core issue of an out-of-control climate, all of our efforts may be for nought. Perhaps our primary focus needs to be human and planetary survival Yes, but some humans, and those who wield the most power, believe that they will be insulated from all this by their wealth and power. They believe the problems will be only for the “little people”. So, nothing to worry about: the High Priests of Techno-Feudalism will save the day through wonderful technology. Or, using some dark sarcasm, Nuclear Winter (Global Dimming) can ameliorate Climate Change. Our wonderful tech overlords will come to the rescue. “We want to get rid of taxes, at least on my constituency, the donor class, the 1%.” Once enough people understand this is the reason oligarchs have funded the conservative and libertarian movements, we may have a chance for real political change. Then, it will be crucial to have in place the idea that in a republic, taxes are one of the most useful tools for eliminating oligarchs and their influence on the political system.

Title: South Florida’s Real Estate Center Of Gravity Is Finally Moving West

ByPeter Lane Taylor ByPeter Lane Taylor, Contributor. By dollar value, it’s been a big month for Florida luxury real estate. Last week, a 15-acre Naples waterfront estate closed for a whopping $225 million, the second highest home sale price in U.S. history and a new state record, dwarfing the $173 million Oracle’s Larry Ellison paid for his Manalapan estate south of Palm Beach in 2022. According to news reports, activist investor David Hoffmann is also under contract on a separate Naples estate for an undisclosed sum north of $100 million. Across the Everglades on the other side of the state, high eight-figure deals are closing at an equivalent clip, including a La Gorce Island estate in Miami Beach which recently settled for $75 million. In total, sixteen homes priced at $40 million-plus have sold in Florida in the past six months. The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg just launched sales. The development is the fourth Waldorf Astoria Residences in the U.S. after Miami, Denver, and Pompano Beach The islands between downtown Miami and Miami Beach on Biscayne Bay, including Star Island in the foreground, feature some of the most expensive waterfront estates in America These are outsized numbers in short order even by Florida’s recent standards, particularly with the stock market whipsawing, the full measure of President Trump’s tariffs still unknown, and the risk of a wider economic downturn looking more plausible by the day. More broadly, the sales reaffirm several current trends. First, the asymmetry between the two ends of the housing market is widening further. On the mid to lower six-figure pitch where most Americans play, the majority of buyers are still spooked by punitive interest rates, stubborn inflation, and a legitimate unease about buying high. Not surprisingly, overall inventory is up, appreciation is decelerating, and sellers no longer have the stronger hand. The other end of the housing market is showing more verve and braggadocio: before COVID, multi-million dollar properties could sit for years. Today, in most markets, they are still trading briskly while largely resisting the headwinds depressing the rest of the industry. Affluent real estate markets with limited inventory like Aspen have experienced a noticeable increase in sales activity since the pandemic The growing asymmetry signals a hardening of a second trend originally triggered by the pandemic. With fiscal certainty still at a premium, wealthy buyers who can close all-cash deals are continuing to seek safe harbor in hard assets with limited supply: ergo, ultra-luxury real estate in NIMBY-enclaves where tight geography and even tighter zoning regulations keep inventory scarce and prices elevated. The S&P 500’s 77% bump since COVID also has roughly doubled the world’s eight and nine figure multi-millionaires. As a result, the overall demand for high-end residences in rarified communities with small airports and long runways, such as Aspen, Park City, Palo Alto, and Naples, looks to remain frothy for the foreseeable future. The third trend borne out of the past month’s lather is geographic. If anything were poised to suck the oxygen out of Florida’s luxury real estate boom since the pandemic, it still hasn’t happened yet. More noticeably, the state’s financial center of gravity is finally, inevitably moving west. Billionaire's Row: The Central Park (l) and Steinway Towers (r) at sunset along 57th St. in Manhattan This is all welcome news for Ryan Shear, Managing Partner at Property Markets Group (PMG), a Miami-based real estate development firm founded by Kevin Maloney in 1991 that’s behind some of America’s most architecturally iconic — and exclusive — residential high rises, including 111 W. 57th St. on Manhattan’s ‘Billionaire’s Row’ (a.k.a. “the world's skinniest skyscraper”) which, at 1,428’, ranks as the second tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. This week, Shear and PMG’s other Managing Partner, Dan Kaplan, announced the launch of the firm’s newest precipitus opus: the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, a soaring 50-story tower that will be the Florida city’s tallest, priciest, and most palatial building once completed in 2030. For the storied hotel brand — originally founded in New York City in 1893 (now owned by Hilton) — the new development will be its fourth residential high rise in the U.S., following groundbreaking on the Waldorf Astoria Pompano Beach this month, the launch of Waldorf Astoria Denver Cherry Creek last year, and the Waldorf Astoria Miami which is currently under construction. For PMG, the project signifies an ever-deeper push into the luxury branded residence space and its biggest bet yet that the hyper-posh, super-amenitized, starchitect-designed high rise formula the company has mastered in Miami is just getting started on the other side of the state. Floor to ceiling windows frame endless Tampa Bay and Gulf views from every floor of the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Gourmet kitchens at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Priced out of Miami, many high net worth individuals are moving their money and Florida's real estate momentum to the state's Gulf Coast including cities like St. Petersburg and Naples The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg (pictured center) will transform the city's skyline and is anticipated to usher in a new wave of luxury development downtown In many respects, Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg is surfing a wave that’s been breaking for years. The branded residential real estate space has been on a tear since well before the pandemic, outpacing the wider housing market by almost every metric and fueling a free-for-all of new entrants and partnerships both in South Florida and around the world. The forces and factors driving the sector — 5-star service, brand loyalty, and higher re-sale value, among others — have been exhaustively covered in dozens of articles, mine included, so I don’t need to undress them further here. What’s noticeably different this time around, though, is the place on the Monopoly board Shear and PMG are putting new foundations in the ground. Historically most high-profile brands that have waded into the fray — among them early pioneers like Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons and, more recently, Nobu, Aston Martin, and Armani — have tended to cluster in glitzy, global metropolises where real estate values already are sky high and the world’s 1% like to throw their money around, such as Manhattan, Miami, and Dubai. They also tend to congregate in exclusive resort destinations in Los Cabos, the Yucatan, and the Caribbean. A dining room rendering at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg Every residence at the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg has its own private foyer That makes the prospect of a Waldorf Astoria tower in downtown St. Petersburg an outlier on the trend line which, in turn, portends a potentially significant shift in how the luxury branded residence game is played. If Florida’s central Gulf Coast — traditionally a magnet for Midwestern retirees and spring break beach benders — is worthy of world-class architecture and a high-society brand like Waldorf Astoria, who’s to say Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs aren’t next? The reality is more complicated. Notwithstanding its fixed, physical form, real estate is innately fluid, albeit on a relatively more molten scale. Tastes change. Buildings decay. Neighborhoods evolve. Consequently, up-and-coming locations that simmered with possibility two decades ago might very well be tapped out today (think Fort Lauderdale). Similarly, cities and commercial corridors currently deemed ‘second tier’ or not befitting a Fendi, Cipriani, or comparably premium brand could be the next Nashville or Park Slope hiding in plain sight. St. Petersburg, Florida is often ranked one of America's best places to live and retire due to its affordability, safety, and healthy quality of life St. Petersburg Beach and Clearwater Beach are two of the state's most stunning stretches of Gulf Coast By this measure, St. Petersburg is definitely having its ‘moment’ — along with the rest of the greater Tampa Bay region for that matter. The drivers behind the boom are the usual Florida suspects: warm weather, low taxes, a healthy lifestyle, strong job growth, and a blossoming entrepreneurial scene thanks to a widespread in-migration of talent during the pandemic. Yet, what’s currently happening in St. Petersburg is also part of a longer-term demographic shift. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties on the state’s Atlantic Coast have finally begun to spill over, and savvy investors and wealthy buyers now priced out of traditionally tony waterfront enclaves like Bal Harbor, Surfside, Jupiter, and SoFi (‘South of Fifth’) in Miami Beach are taking their money — and Florida’s center of affluence — westward. “Florida’s Gulf coast is among the most under-valued real estate markets in the country,” Shear tells me, “Especially compared with cities like Miami and West Palm Beach. St. Pete is a hidden gem that’s been under the radar for a very long time and it’s just beginning to come into its own. The city is also becoming a magnet for high net-worth individuals thanks to its vibrant cultural scene, stunning waterfront, and exceptional quality of life.” Th architecturally iconic Salvador Dali Museum houses the largest collection of work by the famed artist outside of Europe An aerial perspective of St. Petersburg. Tropicana Field in the foreground is the home of MLB's Tampa Bay Rays For the locals and snowbirds who discovered St. Petersburg long before Wall Street and Big Tech did, none of the current praise-heaping comes as a surprise. The city often rates as one of America’s best places to live and retire on account of its affordability, walkability, beach access, up-and-coming culinary scene, and world-renowned art museums, galleries, and performance venues, including the Salvador Dalí Museum as well as the Chiluly Collection at the Morean Arts Center. Socially and economically, St. Pete is also safe and inclusive and boasts a diversified economy with industries like healthcare and technology playing a significant role in the city’s sustainable growth in addition to tourism. In a recent study by WalletHub ranking the “Best-& Worst-Run Cities in America”, St. Pete ranked #1 in Florida overall. Nationally, the city’s economy ranked second, ahead of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Austin (by comparison, Miami came in #62, Fort Lauderdale #121). St. Petersburg Pier is one of the city's most popular tourist attractions Old Southeast is one of St. Petersburg's most historic downtown neighborhoods Sunshine Skyway Bridge connects St. Petersburg to Tampa Bay “St. Pete has arrived,” says Larry Feldman, CEO of Feldman Equities which is co-developing the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg with PMG. “Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed the city’s incredible rise. And the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria brand is testament to this extensive growth and the natural progression St. Pete has undergone. We’re eager to deliver a branded residential development that meets the elevated caliber of living the city’s new residents desire, and I can’t wait to see all of the opportunities and incredible experiences this project will contribute to the downtown area.” The Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg will add a striking new silhouette to the city's waterfront skyline Beach Drive in downtown St Petersburg is one of the city's primary thoroughfares On this last point, Feldman made me realize something else the Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg says about the current state of the branded residential real estate space: that it’s actually quite symbiotic. For Feldman, Shear, PMG, and Waldorf Astoria, St. Pete offers a rare opportunity: a lead position in an A-series funding round if Facebook were luxury real estate. In return, St. Pete gains global credibility virtually overnight thanks to Waldorf’s ‘legitimatizing’ effect on the city’s stature and prestige, much the same way a James Beard Award-winning chef opening up a new restaurant in a neighborhood that’s revitalizing is usually a sure sign it’s “arrived” As a result, the value of Waldorf Astoria coming to St. Petersburg is far from simply architectural or temporarily economic in terms of job creation and investment. The original Waldorf hotel on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan hosted diplomats and distinguished foreign visitors and catered to the needs of New York’s socially prominent, “upper crust". The Waldorf brand was also renowned for setting the original standards for luxury and indulgence in hospitality, including becoming the first hotel in the world to offer electricity and private bathrooms in every room. “A project of this scale and caliber with a globally revered 5-star brand like the Waldorf Astoria attached has a profound, legitimizing effect on a city like St. Petersburg,” explains Shear. “It serves as a powerful signal that the city is not just on the rise, but poised for its next chapter of growth and transformation. St. Pete is a major luxury market that deserves to carry on the Waldorf legacy, and this project will help the city gain global recognition, bring long-term development benefits, and I’m confident that other 5-star brands will follow suit.” Clearwater Beach Pier Kiteboarding on Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg captures the essence of the region's healthy, active, outdoor lifestyle The Museum of Fine Arts in downtown St. Petersburg is one of many nationally and world-renowned arts and cultural institutions in the city Another powerful side effect of a high-profile branded residential real estate project coming to a city like St. Petersburg is its ‘globalizing’ effect, especially when an internationally recognized brand like Waldorf Astoria is involved. Shear anticipates that at least 30% of his buyers will come from Europe and Latin America, most of whom will reside in St. Pete part of the year and all of whom regard their purchases as a long-term financial investment (the other 70% will come from the Midwest and Northeast). “We’re all selling sunshine and low taxes in Florida,” Shear says, “But along the West Coast in areas like Tampa and St. Petersburg specifically, premium real estate remains resilient, driven by sustained demand from both domestic and international high net-worth individuals who view the current market conditions as an opportunity to invest in tangible U.S. assets like real estate, which has long been a cornerstone of long-term wealth building. But unlike other investments, real estate offers the added benefit of personal enjoyment and use, delivering value beyond just financial returns especially when you consider that you’re living in a 5-star hotel.” The Waldorf Astoria St. Petersburg will be the tallest building in the city once it's completed offering endless horizon views from every residence No luxury or amenity is spared at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg, in keeping with the original legacy of the brand Custom made Italian vanities are one of many lavish fixtures and furnishings that are featured in the residences To merge Waldorf Astoria’s rich legacy with St. Pete’s unique history, character, and charm, PMG has tapped CUBE 3 for the tower architecture with interiors curated by the award-winning design firm BAMO. The high rise’s fully finished two- and three-bedroom residences will range from 2,031 square feet to 3,408 square feet and feature private foyers, custom closets, Italian vanities, chef’s kitchens, and expansive terraces with Tampa Bay views along with finishes, furnishings, and appliances befitting the Waldorf reputation for unparalleled décor and design. The tower’s top two-stories will be combined into the penthouse residence that will encompass 10,000 square feet overall with a private pool. On the amenities side, a 20,000-square-foot, resort-style pool deck will feature a 160-foot east pool with Bay views, a sunset pool with dual spas, elegant lounge areas, and a bar, while the Amenity Suite on Level 18 offers a thoughtfully curated wellness center prioritizing holistic healing and connection with nature. Spaces in the center will include private massage rooms, his and her saunas and steam rooms, as well as a state-of-the-art fitness center and movement studio. On Level 46, residents will have exclusive access to the legendary Peacock Alley-inspired Sky Lounge, a signature space that captures the legacy, elegance, and sophistication of the Waldorf Astoria brand. The end of another perfect day at St. Pete Beach As for the next evolution in the luxury branded residence space? Shear remains bullish on the niche market as well as the long-term drivers underpinning it. “We never really know until we launch a new project, but we feel strongly that there is real depth for branded real estate developments not just in cities like Miami, but in cities like St. Petersburg too,” he says. “All indications are that there continues to be strong demand not only for seasoned, well-capitalized developers who deliver on time, but also for 5-star brands like Waldorf Astoria that offer buyers peace of mind, an exceptional quality of life, and design, quality, and craftsmanship that are second to none.” If Shear’s instincts are right — which, based on PMG’s track record, they usually are — St. Petersburg and the wider Tampa Bay region, including Sarasota and Bradenton, are just getting started. Residences at the Waldorf Astoria Residences St. Petersburg start in the mid-$2m.

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement From setting timers to controlling your smart home, here's how Amazon's voice assistant has evolved with new features to make your life easier this spring season. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has evolved far beyond a simple talking speaker. Like Siri on your iPhone, playing music or checking weather updates only scratches the surface of what this technology can accomplish. Today's Alexa can handle sophisticated voice commands, controlling Fire TV devices, managing daily routines and transforming your home into a fully automated smart environment. As we enter spring cleaning season, these capabilities become even more valuable for organizing your home and schedule, especially now with a smarter Alexa Plus with AI-powered features now available. Recent research reveals many users have concerns about these increasingly capable assistants -- a recent CNET survey found 73% of US adults using home voice assistants have privacy concerns about AI integrations, though Amazon's Alexa remains the most trusted voice assistant among respondents. Want to unlock Alexa's full potential? You just need to learn the right commands. If you have an Echo device at home, here's a complete guide to all the voice commands worth trying. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis Topic:Tariffs While Donald Trump focuses on trade deficits with other nations, the US budget deficit continues to grow. (Reuters: Nathan Howard) The turmoil on global markets has taken a breather ever since US President Donald Trump backed away from his grand plan to impose tariffs on almost every other country. Stock markets have recovered almost all the ground they lost in the aftermath of the Liberation Day chaos and even bond markets have scaled back the panic, with yields continuing to edge lower. But the turmoil is likely to resume soon. Consumers globally have scaled back spending, corporations are calibrating the extent to which earnings expectations need to be lowered, American retailers are bracing for shortages and economists now are tipping much lower global growth and the possibility of a US recession. That's because Mr Trump's main target, China, is still facing a broad-based tariff of 145 per cent, which effectively is a ban on Chinese imports. On-again-off-again tariffs and an intensifying trade war with China are taking their toll on ordinary Americans. Even if the China tariffs are halved, that would massively increase US costs and slow output across the globe. And, for what? The White House is convinced that America is a victim of half a century of unfair trade policies that have forced the American people to buy necessities from elsewhere and weakened its global position. According to the president: "It's not just China, the European Union, they ripped us off for many, many years and those days are over," he repeated over the weekend at a doorstop interview. So, is America being ripped off? And will tariffs fix the "problem"? Financial markets have recovered ground since the initial tariff shock and turbulence, but America's economic woes are far from settled. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) In Donald Trump's world, deficits are always bad and surpluses are always good. In isolation, it's an easy concept to sell to a deeply divided nation. You can point to a problem and then apportion blame. But it ignores the fact that the US economy has powered its way to global domination during this period. So, it can't be all bad. Most economists dismiss the idea that a trade deficit, even an ongoing one, is bad. America's trade deficit occurs for the simple reason that Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more from offshore than they sell to foreigners. No-one is forcing them to buy the stuff. It's not the fault of China, or that of Mexico or Canada for that matter. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. Last year, America exported $US4.8 trillion ($7.5 trillion) worth of goods and services and imported $US5.9 trillion in goods and services. That left a $US1 trillion gap, or deficit, which it financed by borrowing. Mostly, it is big corporations buying either finished goods to sell to US citizens or components they need to manufacture goods in the US. It isn't foreign governments behind a grand conspiracy to "rip off" Uncle Sam. It's American companies choosing to buy in goods from offshore. As economist Jeffrey Sachs notes: "Suppose that you go on a shopping binge, spending more than your earnings by running up credit-card debt. It's also worth noting that it is not all gimmicks and gadgets coming across the border. Often, it is high-end equipment needed for industry and specialist services. Put another way, America invests more money than it saves. Tariffs build a wall around your economy. Those walls protect local industry from outside competition and allow industries and firms that ordinarily wouldn't be able to compete to survive. The offset, however, is that consumers have to pay more. Importers pay the tariff and then pass on those higher costs to customers. Many products US shoppers buy are imported from China and now face steep tariffs. (Reuters: Brendan McDermid) Many Americans faced with the prospect of paying far more for imported goods may then switch back to locally-produced goods. But they would be buying items that they previously decided they couldn't afford. That means consumers will have less money to spend on other things and US economic growth is likely to slow. And the price hikes on imported goods means inflation will rise. Another downside is that businesses become accustomed to the protection and, with less competition, don't innovate, so falling behind the rest of the world. From toy brands to fashion labels, some Australian firms are facing tariffs way above the 10 per cent "baseline". There are other issues as well. As we saw in recent weeks, as soon as the US announced the tariffs, those on the receiving end retaliated. That makes it harder for US suppliers to sell into foreign markets. So, while American firms may end up selling more product to Americans, their offshore sales are likely to slump. Any benefit they may have received from being protected at home will be eliminated by penalties in their export markets. This Boeing jet landed back in Seattle, Washington after being returned by a Chinese airline last week. (Reuters: David Ryder) The same goes for foreign firms — offshore sales will fall, which means global growth, not just America's, will slow. While the president bangs on about goods, he rarely mentions services. America exports a large amount of services to the rest of the world. In this area, it racks up a surplus. We're talking about things like education, tourism, software and information services. While the surplus is not enough to overcome the deficit in tradeable goods, the recent tariff hits have enraged other countries and seen a marked drop in foreign students wanting to enter the US, as well as an international backlash from tourists. As a result, the US trade deficit is likely to deteriorate as a result of the tariffs. America doesn't just run a trade deficit. It also runs a massive internal or budget deficit — and that is a far bigger problem. Years of handing out tax cuts to the extremely rich and vast overspending on defence has seen ongoing US budget deficits. You need to borrow to finance that, so the national debt has blown out to 122 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Tesla boss Elon Musk will cut back on his commitment to the Trump administration's DOGE and recommit to the carmaker, in a move cheered by investors after what analysts have called a "disaster" result. Those deficits continue to grow — during Trump's first term, he added $US8 trillion to the now bulging $US36.2 trillion in national debt, mostly through tax cuts. Joe Biden added a similar amount with his Inflation Reduction Act. America now spends more on servicing that debt each year than it spends on defence and the interest bill is the second biggest expense after social security. The White House often incorrectly mentions the national debt as being caused by the trade deficit which it then uses to justify tariffs. But if the tariffs cause GDP growth to slide or, worse, turn negative, then that debt situation could suddenly turn toxic. That's now becoming a real threat as large numbers of economists tip a US recession this year. Even worse, if the tariffs add to inflation and cause higher interest rates, servicing the debt will cost even more and the American economy could end up in serious trouble. America's financial stability has already been called into question by global investors. In the past month, they not only dumped Wall Street stocks, they abandoned US government bonds and the US dollar as well, a previously unimaginable set of events. While the Trump administration has taken aim at the US budget, hacking away at essential government services, it is looking at another massive tax cut for the wealthy which could further undermine the national finances. Globalisation was supposed to usher in a new era of wealth for the planet. Poorer countries would advance into the upper ranks more quickly and developed countries would reap the benefits. Many of those things came to pass, at least on paper. The problem was that the riches weren't doled out fairly. And the US was among the worst in shuffling the benefits through to the uber-rich. Wealth inequality blew out during the past half century. America may be rich on paper but the gap between the haves and the have-nots has widened into a yawning chasm. Mortality rates have risen, life expectancy has dropped, crime and incarceration levels have soared. The chaotic and hasty introduction of protectionism won't solve those problems. It could make them worse.

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!
