A New York financier and his publicly traded firm that bankrolled loans to taxi drivers were fined $4 million for allegedly planting fake news articles online to boost the company’s stock price. Medallion Financial Corp. — which got hit a decade ago as ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft began to tank the value of taxi medallions — will have to pay $3 million as part of a settlement after a judgment by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the US Southern District of New York. Medallion president Andrew Murstein — who made headlines when he hired Nicki Minaj to perform at his son’s bar mitzvah in 2015 — must fork out $1 million in a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a May 29 securities filing. The SEC complaint contained “more than sufficient allegations to support the claim that Murstein and Medallion Financial misled investors by withholding information material to Medallion Bank’s fair value,” Kaplan wrote in his opinion denying the company’s motion to dismiss a case brought in December 2021 under the agency’s President Biden-appointed chair Gary Gensler, The Post previously reported on Murstein’s alleged brazen scheme to secretly pay for “fake news” stories as the rise of Uber and Lyft caused investors to sour on taxi-related stocks, leaving Medallion’s share price floundering. The top executive hired media strategists to place at least 50 stories from 2014 to 2017 on sites such as HuffPost and Crain’s New York Business, according to the SEC complaint. The taxi medallion lender also failed to disclose that the authors of the bogus blogs were being paid, and that many of the stories had been personally tweaked and edited by Murstein, the complaint said. Instead, the posts were written in a way to make it look as if they had been penned by actual investors who were bullish on Medallion stock, the SEC complaint alleged. According to the SEC complaint, he had gone “opinion-shopping” when one valuation firm refused to ignore his deteriorating medallion portfolio and accept his inflated view of the company’s actual worth of $193 million. It resulted in the value of Medallion’s banking unit jumping to $280 million at the end of 2016, from $166 million just two quarters earlier, even as the price of medallions slumped, the complaint said. California PR agent Lawrence Meyers, one of the main communications specialists hired by Murstein, must also pay a $100,000 fine, according to SEC filings. As part of the settlement deal, all defendants neither admit nor deny the allegations, the judgment said. “Our agreement with the SEC puts this nearly decade-old matter behind us and enables us to apply our full focus to continuing to grow the company,” a Medallion spokesperson told The Post on Wednesday. “It removes the distraction, cost, and uncertainty of continued litigation and is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders.” News of the settlement was first reported by American Banker on Tuesday. The brash boss and his father, Leon, raked in more than $42 million from 2002 to 2014, according to the New York Times. Aside from spending lavishly on the “WAP” singer, Medallion Financial bought up professional lacrosse and NASCAR teams, the paper reported. “One wonders if the SEC is going easy on them a bit, due to the change in administration or lack of staff,” a source close to the situation told The Post. “That should give investors pause for thought if boards and executives can get away with such behavior.” President Trump-nominated SEC Chair Paul Atkins replaced Gensler. Rebecca Fike, a partner at Vinson & Elkins and a former SEC enforcement attorney, added that it shows “a desire to wrap up actions that were initiated under the previous administration.” “I expect the Atkins SEC to favor quicker resolutions and accept much lower civil penalties, particularly where the staff cannot show a corporate benefit from the fraudulent acts,” she told The Post. The company’s stock closed Wednesday at $9.50. By law, there are only 13,587 taxi medallions in New York City, and each yellow cab must have a medallion linked to it. Prices for a prized medallion soared to as much as $1 million under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But they plunged under tougher competition from the ride-sharing apps, leaving the drivers drowning in debt and piling the pressure on Medallion’s profit margins. Medallion went public in 1996. The company had been originally set up by Murstein’s taxi-driving father, a Polish immigrant, who started trading some of the cab medallions. A driver would put up roughly a third of the purchase price when buying the permit, with Medallion financing the rest with interest over a fixed period of time. After years of protests from drivers amid the rise of digital rivals, former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a deal in November 2021 to cap medallion loans at $170,000 and interest repayments at 5%. Medallion has since tried to shift to more traditional consumer and commercial banking over the past few years. Advertisement

Title: 3 Key Tax Considerations For The $1,000 Trump Savings Accounts

ByNathan Goldman ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 06: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) An important provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the House of Representatives is the creation of the Trump Accounts. According to a Forbes article, these savings accounts will be funded by the federal government and they will provide each baby born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, with $1,000 for investment. This benefit is a unique solution to some of the problems plaguing taxpayers who struggle to invest in their and their children’s future. The Milken Institute estimates that this $1,000 investment would grow to over $8,000 by the time the child reaches the age of 18, providing substantial financial support that can be used for education, starting a business, or property ownership. According to CNBC, business leaders like Michael Dell (Dell Technologies), Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber), and David Solomon (Goldman Sachs) have all pledged significant support for this proposal. Despite the benefits of receiving $1,000 from the federal government, the initial set of rules is complicated, and there are three crucial tax considerations based on the current drafting of this provision. Stock prices go up and down on a continuous basis. Investors do not pay taxes on those fluctuations. When investors dispose of their stock, they recognize a gain or loss on the difference between the purchase price and the sales price. However, if the stock is invested in a retirement fund (i.e., a 401k or IRA), then the gain is deferred until the money is withdrawn from the account. This allows the account to grow tax deferred. Tax deferral is a valuable financial tool since it allows taxpayers to pay current tax liabilities at a future date. Given that inflation typically hovers around a couple of percentage points, time value of money principles suggest that deferring tax liability to a future year can save the taxpayer significant amounts of money. This deferral also applied to the Trump Accounts. Taxpayers’ children will receive this $1,000, and the money will be invested and tax deferred. Once the child turns 18, the money can be withdrawn, and the person can pay taxes on the difference between the current value and the initial amount invested. Built into the rules is a complex treatment for how the gains will be taxed. According to the Tax Foundation, if the funds are withdrawn and used for school tuition, a first-time home purchase, or a small business expense, they will be subject to capital gains tax. In 2025, single taxpayers who earn less than $48,350 pay 0% capital gains tax. As a typical 18-year-old does not make above this amount, these individuals will tend not to face a tax liability if the funds are applied toward one of these qualified activities. However, if the funds are applied toward a non-qualified activity, the individual will pay taxes on the gains at an ordinary rate. Even among the lowest-earning taxpayers, they would face a 10% income tax rate on this income. Even though the program provides a universal and automatic benefit to taxpayers, according to CNN, it is regressive in nature. Being regressive means that due to some of the tax considerations, it has the potential to benefit higher-earning taxpayers relatively more than lower-earning taxpayers. This relative benefit that makes it regressive is twofold. First, higher-earning taxpayers have a larger tax benefit from these funds. For instance, consider a married taxpayer with $1 million in taxable income. If this taxpayer invests $1,000 for their child when born, the high-earning taxpayer would owe 37% tax on the growth in the fund (20% if the growth receives preferential capital gain treatment). Meanwhile, a married taxpayer with a taxable income of $75,000 would only face a 12% ordinary income tax rate and would not owe any taxes if the gain qualifies for the preferential capital treatment. Thus, the tax treatment for this program has a relatively larger benefit for the higher-income taxpayer. Second, while the federal government will provide $1,000 to all children born during the specified time period, the child can have these contributions of up to $5,000 per year. Even though nothing expressly prohibits families from contributing additional funds to their children’s account, this portion of the provision has a clearer benefit for higher-earning families, who are in a better position to provide the additional contributions. Put differently, this provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows taxpayers a vehicle to defer taxes, and this vehicle can be taken advantage of by higher-earning taxpayers generally more easily than lower-earning taxpayers.

Is dinner time a daily struggle? If you have more than a few mouths to feed, it sure can feel that way. As a toddler-mom, I know the challenge all too well. If half my daughter’s food doesn’t end up splattered across the floor, I consider that a win. A big win. Sometimes, that simply means resorting to pizza delivery. Other days, it means digging through the pantry until I find something I purchased in 2018. Neither feels like the solution I’m looking for. Suffice it to say, family meal kits have turned into our saving grace. Everyone has their own taste, and if there are kiddos involved, half the battle is searching for a recipe that will appease those uber-picky eaters. Lucky for you and your little ones, most family-friendly meal kits offer a rotating menu curated across a variety of diets and preferences, from crowd-pleasing comfort foods to keto-friendly options for health-conscious households. There are even some gourmet plans to try for the families wishing to brush up on their chef skills. To guide your search for easier meals (and more sanity), we’ve spent hours researching, ordering, cooking, and taste-tasting some of the best meal kits for families on the market. We considered top-rated delivery services, from Factor to HelloFresh, as well as dedicated kids’ options like Little Spoon, too. Whether you’re looking for the best made-from-scratch meals, microwave-ready options, or a subscription service that will save you time and a few bucks, this roundup has got something for you. Behold, the best meal delivery service for families, delivered right to your doorstep. Pros: Cons: A family meal kit roundup is not complete without HelloFresh. The company is one of the first brands to enter the meal-subscription service, and today, they go by the simple motto: Eat Well. Feel Good. Save Time. Our editors have tested HelloFresh many times since it opened in 2012, and this time around, we decided to look into their family-friendly meal kits. For a free high-protein item for life and 10 free meals, use code “NYP10FMFS“. New York Post Review: HelloFresh has managed to maintain a stellar reputation for years, so I was curious to see just how seamless the service was. Spoiler: I was sold in the first five minutes. My daughter and I aren’t afraid of some flavor (and spice), and it wasn’t hard to find meals that could satisfy both cravings on its menu. We ordered the Coconut Curry Chicken, Apricot, Almond & Chickpea Tagine, Coconut Curry Tofu with Bok Choy, and Sweet Sesame Udon with Chicken & Red Peppers. My order arrived right on time for its scheduled Wednesday delivery, dropped right on my doorstep. The box was stacked with ice packs, and each meal was neatly packed into a brown paper bag with proteins stored on ice below. The recipe pages were placed on top, with images and easy step-by-step directions so even amateur home-chefs can follow along. Overall, I was very impressed. Everything was neat, aesthetic, and my favorite part, easy to get rid of. The expected preparation time for my home-cooked meals was around 25 minutes, but we clocked out in about 20. I’m an avid believer that your toddler doesn’t need to eat separately from the adults, and I found that HelloFresh had options that were enjoyable for all parties. Finetuning the recipes is easy. For my daughter, I cut the serving size in half and used the spice packets a bit more sparingly. I was pleasantly surprised by how filling everything was. HelloFresh isn’t pretending to be gourmet, but the meals were appetizing and on the heartier side. Some leftover can be expected. HelloFresh offers a variety of plans suited to different needs. Simply select the number of meals needed per week and the number of mouths to feed (up to six people). From there, you can select preferences — meals in under 20 minutes, protein-packed varieties, and the easiest family-friendly options. HelloFresh generates a menu that works well for you, and you won’t have a hard time finding something everyone can agree on. Pros: Cons: Little Spoon is a pioneer in the kids’ meal kit space, setting a new standard with its diverse menu for picky eaters and their health-conscious parents. All recipes are certified organic, developed by experts, and packed with real ingredients that little ones love (heavy on the fruits, veggies, and whole grains). In 2024, Little Spoon became the first U.S. baby food brand to adopt EU-aligned safety standards for its Babyblends. New York Post Review: To be completely candid, it’s pretty slim pickings when it comes to kids’ food delivery services. When I heard about Little Spoon, I knew I needed to give it a shot. These beautifully packaged kids’ meals come in every shape, size, and flavor profile, so you can stock your fridge and forget about the rest. The subscription service is very straightforward. It’s also easy to filter for gluten-free, dairy-free, and nut-free items, so families with special diets or allergies should have no problem finding what they need. I settled on a mix of their best-sellers like Turkey Kale Meatballs, Rosemary Chicken, Spinach and Cheese Ravioli, Pizzalicious Veggie Loops, the Golden Apple Pie Smoothie, and more tasty snacks. The order arrived a few days after it was placed, in a durable box with all heat-and-eat meals completely frozen. Everything was clearly labeled and vacuum-sealed in BPA, BPS, and Phthalate-free packaging. The best part about this service is easily the fact that no preparation is necessary. For the frozen meals, you can simply pop them in the microwave. Snack bags and smoothies are also resealable, so you can take them on the go. My daughter greets each Little Spoon meal with delight; the portions are just right, textures are easy, and flavors are bursting. Half the time, she’s begging for more, which is quite the 180 from the finicky eater I used to know. I had to try a taste for myself to see what it was all about, and I can affirm — Little Spoon understands how to lock in freshness. I wouldn’t know better if you said they came right from a restaurant. Yes, this service is made for kids, but I’d be lying if I said I haven’t popped a meal in the microwave for myself, too. From hearty chef-curated Lunchers and Plates suited for every eating stage, to slurpable Smoothies, perfectly-portioned Biteables, and Puffs for school lunches and snacking. Little Spoon has a little bit of everything, making it a great choice for families with young children. All products are USDA-certified organic, non-GMO, and Clean Label Project certified. Little Spoon offers a selection of meals tailored to different age groups, each with its own price range. The subscription service is simple. Following the first order, all future deliveries are scheduled to ship every two weeks. Customers can also skip, cancel, and edit menu plans at any time. Larger bundles offer the best meal discounts. A standard shipping fee of $10 is applied to all orders. Pros: Cons: Factor might be the best prepared meal delivery for families, especially if you’re factoring in calories while counting the clock. These meals require no prep and no cooking. The entire menu is dietitian-approved and chef-prepared, and all you’ll need to do is pop your plates into the microwave for two minutes and enjoy. The protein-heavy menu spans from seafood delicacies like Salmon Piccata to Fajita-Spiced Shrimp and Filet Mignon, as well as tasty plates like Blueberry Pancakes and Kale and Mushroom Egg Bites, so you could have breakfast, lunch, and dinner covered. Get up to $130 off and free shipping on your first box with promo code “NYP130FS“. Families barely have enough time to set the table, let alone prepare homemade meals. Factor is an attractive choice for those who would prefer heat-and-eat meals that can be stored in the fridge and freezer. This entirely pre-made delivery service also offers protein shakes, snacks, and fresh juices that are perfect for families looking to meet health goals. Simply order as many as you’ll need to feed the entire family. Pros: Cons: Feeding the whole family gets pricey. EveryPlate has positioned itself as a more budget-friendly meal delivery service, and they’ve made good on that promise. Meals start at around $5.99 per serving, making it more affordable than strong competitors like Blue Apron and even HelloFresh. The recipes are a bit simpler, as is the packaging, which helps keep prices lower for customers. To pay just $1.99 per meal on your first box, use code “NYP199EP“. New York Post Review: EveryPlate’s menu may have been absent of filets and fancy recipes I can’t pronounce, but I was still pleasantly surprised with the options. I ordered a sampling of the Hawaiian-Style Loco Moco, Saucy Black Bean Fajita Burrito Bowls, and Soy-Marinated Steak Fried Rice. Everything was delivered in a brightly-colored cardboard box that arrived ahead of schedule. Upon breaking it open, I noticed the ingredients were all placed together in one bag, with meat and fish placed below. This is a bit different than HelloFresh, which wraps meals separately, but it’s no bother as long as you save some time to sort through the ingredients. It took some time to find what I needed for the different recipes, but once that was out of the way, the rest of the preparation process was seamless. The meal cards have large photographs for those who are more visually oriented. I probably could have figured out how to make the black bean bowl from pictures alone, and for busy parents, that type of intuitive cooking is greatly appreciated. It saves time, energy, and takes out the guesswork. Another big draw: The recipes are simple, so simple in fact that my toddler was able to assist in stirring up some sauces. Sure, EveryPlate cuisine might not look like it came out of a Michelin-star restaurant (frankly, kids don’t care about that), but the meals were still tasty and just as good as leftovers the next day. My daughter devoured the Saucy Black Bean Fajita Burrito Bowls (pictured above) within minutes, and it’s typically a battle just to get her to try any type of veggie, let alone peppers, onions, and tomatoes in one dish. Since EveryPlate has a smaller menu to choose from, you may notice some repetition. However, families who value affordability, consistency, and practicality might appreciate having fewer choices — we sure did. EveryPlate caters to a more value-driven crowd, ideal for college students, first-time meal kit users, and families with young children. Meal plans range from two to six people, with three to five meals per week. The menu rotates with about 20 choices, and most meals are ready in 20 minutes or less. Customers can filter for family faves, quick and easy recipes, healthier options, and more suited for different diets. Pros: Cons: If you’re all about options, Blue Apron is hard to beat. The rotating menu features over 100 meals every week, which makes it easy for foodies to find something fresh and exciting every time they put in their order. It’s easy to filter for carb-conscious options, family favorites, seasonal veggie varieties, and more categories customized to your liking. There’s even a section dedicated just to desserts, so sweet-tooths are satisfied too. Blue Apron has also positioned itself as a more sustainable choice, as far as subscription services go. Their team partners with experts to create better standards for growing food and raising animals, committing to antibiotic and hormone-free meats and selecting seafood recommended by Seafood Watch, so customers know they’re meals are sustainably sourced and safe to eat. Blue Apron isn’t just a meal kit subscription, it’s designed to teach you how to cook new recipes you may have never tried before. This service is a great way to introduce kids to new flavors and spend quality time with each other in the kitchen. As far as meal plans go, customers can choose from over 20 weekly options of never frozen, microwave-ready meals in 1, 2, 3, or 4 serving sizes. You can stop or skip at any time and shop single-serve options from the Marketplace, no subscription required. Based on our testing and research, EveryPlate was the most cost-effective meal kit for large families. Meals average at roughly $5.99 per serving, with a shipping fee of $9.99 per order. However, the overall price-per-meal decreases with orders of larger quantities. For five meals that cater to six people a week, the total cost comes to just $1.99 per serving. First-time customers can also score a discount of up to 66% off the total cost of their order. To review the best family meal kits, we evaluated the meal delivery services on a few factors: taste, nutrition, convenience, variety, and overall value. Each factor played a key role in determining whether the service was worth the cost for parents. Looking for a headline-worthy haul? Keep shopping Post Wanted.

Title: Uber CEO Says Stablecoins ‘Super Interesting’ Play for Transportation Giant As Circle Debuts on US Stock Market

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says that the ride-sharing and delivery company is eyeing stablecoins as a tool for business. In an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, Khosrowshahi says that Uber is looking at the use cases for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets such as the US dollar. “We’re still in the study phase, but I think stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value. Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and people have different opinions on where it’s going.” One stablecoin use case that Khosrowshahi believes could benefit Uber and other companies is its potential to reduce the costs associated with transferring money internationally. “I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs in terms of moving money internationally. So that’s super interesting to us. And we’re definitely going to take a look.” Khosrowshani’s statements come following stablecoin giant Circle’s debut as a public company on Thursday.

Title: Have Reporting Burdens Led To More Firms Staying Private?

ByShivaram Rajgopal ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 10: The Uber banner hangs outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ... More before the Opening Bell at the NYSE as the ride-hailing company Uber makes its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) on May 10, 2019 in New York City. Uber will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange after raising $8.1 billion in the biggest U.S. IPO in five years.Thousands of Uber and other app based drivers protested around the country on Wednesday to demand better pay and working conditions including sick leave, over time and a minimum wage. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The best evidence for this hypothesis comes from micro-caps. Confounding trends and offsetting benefits of being public are often ignored by advocates for reducing reporting rules. The number of US public firms has fallen in recent times. Prof. Jay Ritter, who tracks these numbers, documents that we had 3,804 US listed firms at the end of 2024 relative to the peak of around 8000 in 1996. Remarkably we had 1,384 foreign firms listed at the end of 2024. Many blame higher costs reporting and auditing for the smaller number of US listed firms. They point to the cumulative onslaught of Sarbanes Oxley 2022, the 2003 Global Settlement that alleged made it harder for analysts to cover small firms, Dodd-Frank 2010, and the supposedly relentless pace of accounting and auditing regulation pushed by Congress, the SEC and the FASB. The question I want to address is whether there is any evidence for that claim. Trend depends on benchmark period In a research note, Vanguard points out that if we go back to 1972, the decline shrinks to a third. On top of that, 1972 was the year NASDAQ was set up and 3,000 odd new companies entered the public arena. Why the fall? Doidge, Karolyi, Shen and Stulz (2025) list two potential underlying reasons: (i) it is easier to stay private because restrictions on staying private have softened and it has become easier to raise funds for private firms, perhaps due to the low interest rate environment; and (ii) antitrust enforcement over the last decade has been relatively lax and product market competition has heated up leading to a greater number of mergers. They don’t seem to devote much space to reporting cost burden. Acquisitions drive most of the decline A McKinsey piece shows that 95% of the exits from our markets are driven by acquisitions. Thus, the so-called missing companies have not left the investible universe for the US investor as the investor gets indirect exposure to the target via the acquirer’s stock. Espen Eckbo makes the acquisition point more rigorously. However, the rate of entry and exit into public markets is not uniform across industries. We had more IPOs, relative to exits, in pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The number of IPOs, relative to exits, are more or less the same in retail, materials, consumer apparel and durables. Exits far exceed IPOs in banking, software, technology hardware, media and telecom. Any theory that argues reporting burdens are a first order problem needs to explain why such burden has massively increased for banking, software, tech hardware, media and telecom relative to pharma. Smaller IPOs, mostly micro-caps, gone The McKinsey piece also makes the interesting point that we have far fewer smaller IPOs now relative to the past. This suggests that more of the earlier value is captured by private investors, as private equity firms seem to take longer to exit their positions now relative to before (3 years in 2007 relative to 6 years in 2015). One could argue that the costs of reporting, auditing and compliance have become too large for smaller IPOs to even think about going public. Vanguard points out that the missing IPOs are micro-caps. Is the loss of micro-caps a policy concern? Moreover, Mauboussin, Callahan, and Majd (2017) and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017) note that half of what can be referred to as the “listing gap” (exits more than IPOs) occurred before Sarbanes Oxley became law. Start-ups have declined too Somewhat intriguing, the number of start-ups appears to display mixed patterns since 1996. The Kaufmann index of startup activity falls from 1996 to its nadir in 2013, after which it picks up till 2017, when the index was last published but the 2017 number was still lower than the 1996 number. This suggests that there may be fewer businesses even available to go public. International exchanges I am in the UK as I write this and an institutional investor I know here suggested that the London stock exchange has suffered a similar decline in IPOs. In fact, there is some angst in the UK that they are losing listings to the US. The loss in listings applies to other advanced economies as well, as Espen Eckbo points out. The theory pushing for reporting burdens as the primary explanation will have to explain why UK reporting and reporting in other advanced economies has also become onerously burdensome. Burgeoning private equity (PE) A senior executive tells me,” the payouts achieved by management and their VCs by arranging acquisitions to PE firms, as well as PE to PE sales have been, in recent times, just as compelling as anything other than a truly dramatic IPO. Smaller companies, companies with significant internal ownership, companies without strong growth or high investment opportunities (that is to say not pharma or biotech who absolutely need risk capital), companies where management would like to stay involved but are not keen on public company visibility. These are all great reasons to be acquired by PE rather than either IPO or even getting acquired by a public company rapidly, with certainty, without much publicity. PE is incredibly well equipped at maximizing ongoing cashflows, and growth, while still maintaining: (i) particularly attractive incentives for management in the transaction, (ii) management that stays post transaction with significant incentive retentions and milestones -- all without pesky proxy announcements about executive compensation; and (iii) objectively great returns to those equity holders that are just selling.” The role of reporting for intangibles Rene Stulz (2018) has suggested that new firms heavily invest in intangibles and forced disclosure of intangibles by securities laws, all else constant, encourage firms to stay private. I am not sure of this argument as US public firms barely tell us anything about their intangible investments, especially home grown ones. Papers suggesting that SOX increased regulatory burdens Zhang (2007) finds negative returns of around -15% to -13% around the events surrounding the passage of SOX. I find these returns too large to be credible. Engel, Hayes, and Wang (2007) observed an increase in decisions to go private after SOX. But this evidence is mixed. Bartlett (2008) of the Stanford Law School re-examines this question and concludes, “non-SOX factors were the primary impetus for the "name brand" buyouts commonly evoked as evidence that SOX has harmed the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets.” Iliev (2010) is perhaps the best cited paper in the area. Using careful research designs, Iliev documents that section 404 of the SOX, which mandates that the auditor attest the internal controls of the firm for the absence of a material weakness, led to conservative reported earnings but also imposed real costs. Iliev compares audit fees and earnings quality for firms with float of $50-75 million to those just above at $75 million-$100 million. The idea is that firms in these two partitions are mostly similar except that Section 404 applies only to firms with float greater than $75 million. He concludes, “on net, SOX compliance reduced the market value of small firms” and increases audit fees by 167%. Atanasov and Black (2020) replicate Iliev (2010) and conclude that not controlling for firm growth led Iliev (2010) to overestimate SOX compliance costs in his analysis. However, the increase in audit fees suffered by the small firms is real, by about 80%. The dollar numbers underlying these estimates are worth reiterating. The average firm in Iliev’s affected firm sample pays more than $0.7 million in greater audit fees. The mean and median earnings of sample firms is -$4.8 million and -$1.4 million respectively. Iliev uses this comparison to argue that the compliance costs of section 404 were substantial. Were they? Would these firms have survived had section 404 not been enacted? Is it obvious that investors would have wanted to invest in such firms? And, how much of the audit fee hike is temporary for a year or two. Even more noteworthy, this evidence relates to micro caps (defined as stocks with market capitalizations of between $50 million and $250 million in 2024). These numbers would be smaller if we went back in time as stock markets have gone up quite a bit in the last 20 years or so. The bigger question is how can we possibly generalize evidence reliant on a sample of microcaps to the entire corporate ecosystem? Ewens, Xiao and Xu (2024), in a new paper, move this literature forward and consider three such natural breakpoints to estimate costs of mandatory reporting: (i) firms below $25 million in float in 1992 were designated as “small businesses” and escaped a few disclosure requirements; (ii) the $75 million float threshold that Iliev looked for section 404 of SOX; and (iii) the $700 million float threshold used in the 2012 JOBS Act. The 2012 JOBS Act is interesting because the point of that legislation was to exempt smaller firms from a few reporting requirements. So, the JOBS Act presents a bit of a counterfactual to the usual setting whereby regulation increased. Based on these events, they claim that the median firm spends 4.3% of its market capitalization on compliance costs. I find the 4.3% number somewhat big. Moreover, even with the clever econometrics used in the paper, can one really generalize estimates from SOX and JOBS Act to the universe of firms? I don’t know. Interestingly, Ewens et al. themselves seem to conclude, “heightened regulatory costs only explain a small fraction of the decline in the number of public firms over the last two decades. Our results suggest that non-regulatory factors likely played a more important role in explaining the decline in the number of U.S. public firms.” Evidence around the 2012 JOBS Act Researchers are generally good at coming up with unintended consequences of regulations that public firms are required to follow. But we don’t often see studies that document the offsetting benefits of going or staying public. The 2012 JOBS Act presents a rare opportunity to consider whether relaxing reporting regulations encourages more IPOs. Dambra et al. (2015) conclude that the 2012 JOBS Act led to an increase of 21 IPOs a year, on average. Ewens et al. (2024) find a slightly higher estimate: roughly 28 additional IPOs. One must wonder whether 20 odd IPOs per year are worth the potential collateral damage to the credibility of US reporting and compliance systems, if the PCAOB were to be dismantled or SOX were to be repealed. Incidentally, many other advanced economies passed regulation, modeled on SOX, in their own countries. Did they not conduct a careful assessment of costs of such regulation on their IPO activity? Or did they recognize the need to tighten up reporting and audit rules after the tech bubble burst in 2001? IPO Tax Robert Jackson's, the ex-SEC commissioner, analysis highlights the 7% tax that middle market IPOs must pay even before they go public, to investment bankers, lawyers and the like. Surely, the IPO tax, which has little to do per se with the reporting and compliance costs of 4.3% highlighted by Ewens et al, deserves more attention. The advocates of cutting reporting burdens are somewhat silent about reducing the 7% middle market IPO tax. And I am aware of startups that are working on software that can write an S1 in minutes with AI. Shouldn’t the 4.3% reporting costs, estimated by Ewens et al., fall? Benefits of staying public are often ignored Owners, VCs, and capital providers get liquidity. Public firms can potentially pay labor mostly via stock and hence attract higher quality talent. Stock can be used as a means of payment to buy another company and hence take out a rival or to buy a complementary firm. If you get acquired, the acquirer is usually expected to pay a 25% control premium over the prevailing stock price. In sum, the case for reporting burdens forcing companies to stay private is far from clear. The best evidence relates to micro-caps and generalizing from that set to other companies is not straightforward. Partisan debate about the evidence often tends to ignore the vast number of confounding factors such as low interest rates, falling number of start-ups, special time periods chosen for the analysis and large number of acquisitions of public firms and the 7% IPO tax. If anything, US reporting rules need to be strengthened, not weakened. I have pointed out, time and again, the deficiencies in our financial reporting system and how auditors could potentially do a better job. Regulators may want to proceed with caution the next time someone brings up the hypothesis that reporting burdens are a significant barrier to US firms going public.
