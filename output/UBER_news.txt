Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

Become a Member for as little as $4/mo and enjoy unlimited reading of TSLL blog. Bursting at the seams in all the right ways. We’ve got books – fiction, cookbooks, inspired by French history, hopeful books, health books and more. Films for Anglophiles and films for family reconciliation, returning favorite television dramas with engaging leading ladies, clothes – oh my! – to continue to polish your autumn wardrobe – loafers, sweaters, totes and still there is more. Did I mention there is a must-see exhibit in London to check out? Yep, that too! Art —Marie Antoinette Style exhibit at Victoria & Albert Museum, London If you will be in London between September 20th through March 22nd of 2026, and if Marie Antoinette’s style piques your interest, be sure to put a visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum on your itinerary. The Maria Antoinette Style exhibit centers around the “complex fashion icon, Marie Antoinette’s timeless appeal, [ever so much] defined by her style, youth and notoriety. Explore the lasting influence of the most fashionable (and ill-fated) queen in history – with over 250 years of design, fashion, film and art.” Books —Beyond Blue and White: The Hidden History of Delftware and the Women Behind the Iconic Ceramic by Genevieve Wheeler Brown Delft anything. Vases, tiles, bowls, you name it, most of us can identify these beautiful pieces when we see them, but where did it all begin and how did they become iconic? And more interestingly, who are the women that were part of the history that made it so? All of this is the focus of Genevieve Wheeler Brown’s new book Beyond Blue and White. Having read a recent review in the WSJ, and being fortunate to have found a Delft vase that I now regularly use and love, I always love learning more about the history of items that catch my eye, and Delftware is one of them. In the book you will “meet female Delftware makers, including Barbara Rotteveel founder of ‘The Three Bells’ Delftware factory in 1671, be introduced to female Delftware patrons such as Queen Mary II, who found her means of expression while creating a vogue in the 17th century for Delft blue and white across royal courts. And then there are the female collectors beginning in the 19th century who saw the artistry and craft in these ceramics others had overlooked. Foremost among them was Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II who came together with fellow New York women and laid the groundwork for women in the museum world while preserving decorative arts with an educational mission.” “What begins as a curatorial exercise quickly evolves not only into an exploration of this colorful, expressive, and sometimes even humorous decorative art, coveted for hundreds of years, but also an unexpected uncovering of forceful female lives yet untold.” —Books: A Manifesto, Or, How to Build a Library by Ian Patterson Looking forward to getting my hands on this one and adding it to my library, and if you too are a fellow bibliophile, this is a book for you! Currently only available in the UK (ship to the US from Blackwells), Books: A Manifesto, or How to Build a Library is “Wise, irreverent and exhilaratingly wide-ranging” Ian Patterson “insists on reading not as a luxury but a necessary part of reality: we live within language, and when we think, it’s with the tools that reading gives us.” “Our time of cultural and political crisis demands more than books – but without them, and without the breadth of knowledge, sense of history, awareness of alternatives and hope for the future they offer, things will not get better. At once a primer for enriching your own library and a manifesto for why that matters, this book is an invitation to a deeper, richer world of thought and feeling – and a reminder of just how much books matter.” Just released yesterday on September 11th, you can find it available to ship now from Blackwells. —History Matters by David McCullough A book about and written by one of the bestselling historians of the 20th and early 21st century, History Matters, released on Tuesday the 16th, is a posthumous collection of thought-provoking essays—many never published before—[from] Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and author David McCullough affirms the value of history, how we can be guided by its lessons, and the enduring legacy of American ideals.” “Edited by McCullough’s daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, History Matters is a tribute to a master historian and offers fresh insights into McCullough’s enduring interests and writing life. McCullough highlights the importance of character in political leaders, with Harry Truman and George Washington serving as exemplars of American values like optimism and determination. He shares his early influences, from the books he cherished in his youth to the people who mentored him. He also pays homage to those who inspired him, such as writer Paul Horgan and painter Thomas Eakins, illustrating the diverse influences on his writing as well as the influence of art.” To be released on September 16th One of my favorite titles by McCullough was The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris —Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki Released earlier this month, and a book determined to demonstrate how the less we know and take at face value – headlines, screaming viral social media moments, you get the idea – the more we can buy the hype of hopelessness. Thankfully, Hope for Cynics argues that “we don’t have to remain stuck in this cynicism trap. Through science and storytelling, Jamil Zaki imparts the secret for beating back cynicism: hopeful skepticism—thinking critically about people and our problems, while honoring and encouraging our strengths. Far from being naïve, hopeful skepticism is a precise way of understanding others that can rebalance our view of human nature and help us build the world we truly want.” I am here for it. Thank you Zaki for writing this book. —No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek While listening to book recommendations from the staff of NPR as they shared what they read and enjoyed this summer, Haley Mletek’s memoir sounded intriguing. No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce was inspired by the author’s own navigation through divorce and comes at this often talked about subject in a different way. Released back in February, Mlotek “combines her personal story while searching social and literary exploration [to share] a deeply felt and radiant account of 21st century divorce—the remarkably common and seemingly singular experience, and what it reveals about our society and our desires for family, love, and friendship. Mlotek asks profound questions about what divorce should be, who it is for, and why the institution of marriage maintains its power, all while charting a poignant and cathartic journey away from her own marriage towards an unknown future.” —Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body by Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D From the podcaster behind Huberman Lab, and neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Huberman “introduces Protocols, an essential guide to improving brain function, enhancing mood and energy, optimizing bodily health and physical performance, and rewiring your nervous system to learn new skills and behaviors that can transform your life.” Being released next Tuesday, “Protocols provides simple, powerful, and evidence-based solutions to life’s most common challenges. Designed to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance, these guidelines are customizable, allowing you to adapt them to your specific needs. With his clear and engaging style, Dr. Huberman explains the scientific principles behind each protocol and how they can deliver immediate, effective results.” British Finds —Barbour x Tuckernuck collection Tuckernuck has partnered up with a favorite long-standing British brand, Barbour, to come up with a collection of quite a few good items for the autumn wardrobe. Loving the scarves, the travel umbrella, and there are a few classic quilted Barbour coats to peek at was well. Don’t forget about the sweaters and button-ups. I have shopped a few below in the scroll. —SHOP THE COLLECTION: —Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale It’s here folks. Both absolutely beyond eager to watch, and yet, reticent as well. Reviewers are in agreement that the finale will please fans – read NYTimes review here, Daily Beast and AP, with The Guardian is skeptical this film will really be the true finale of the Crawleys. And at some point this weekend, I will be watching it in the theater where it deserves to be watched. If you too will be joining the throng of crowds, I hope you enjoy the two hours of this captivating family’s story we’ve been watching since September 2010. Watch an official clip from the film about why Lady Mary’s divorce occurred that begins the film. Cookbooks —Abundance: Stories and Recipes from a Gardening Cook by Mark Diacono Only available in the UK (but you can have it shipped to the US from Blackwells), Abundance: Eating And Living with the Seasons from cook and gardener Mark Diacono looks delicious both in its approach and in its ideas. “With his days distracted by the ping of communication and the tug of commitments, Mark Diacono wondered how he might better savour this one precious life. He started to write and photograph each week, hoping that this simple commitment might sharpen his appreciation of the magic in the everyday and his time spent in the kitchen. It reminds us that abundance comes in many forms – the passing of the seasons, our connection to the world around us, and the wealth that a garden, a town and its surrounding landscapes offers. “With over 80 recipes like Early summer shakshuka, Salsify and radicchio gratin, Onion seed and oregano flower focaccia, Fig leaf and olive oil ice cream, and a Mulberry martini, there are dishes to inspire and satisfy every week as the year unfolds before you.” —Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love by Samin Nosrat Long awaited from international bestselling cookbook author and star of the Netflix series inspired by the book, Samin Nosrat’s new book Good Things will be released on Tuesday. Described as ” an essential, joyful guide to cooking and living, whether you’re looking for a comforting tomato soup to console a struggling friend, seeking a deeper sense of connection in your life, or hosting a dinner for ten in your too-small dining room. Here you’ll find go-to recipes for ricotta custard pancakes, a showstopping roast chicken burnished with saffron, a crunchy, tingly Calabrian chili crisp, super-chewy sky-high focaccia, and a decades-in-the-making, childhood-evoking yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Along the way, you’ll also find plenty of tips, techniques, and lessons, from how to buy olive oil (check the harvest date) to when to splurge (salad dressing is where you want to use your best ingredients) to the best uses for your pressure cooker (chicken stock and dulce de leche, naturally).” “Enjoy 125 meticulously tested, flavor-forward, soul-nourishing recipes that bring joy and a sense of communion.” Film —Looking Through Water Almost immediately, this new film, starring Michael Douglas and his son, reminded me of On Golden Pond where another real-life parent and child take to the screen to tell a familiar story of healing. Looking Through Water will premiere this weekend in select theaters and tells the story of a father’s attempt to reconnect with his estranged son, doing so by inviting him to compete in a father-son fishing competition.” Have a look at the trailer below. Francophile Finds —French Country Crocks New to the shop at Farm House Pottery from Farmhouse Pottery fromVivi et Margot are French Country Crocks drawing inspiration from “the charm of the French countryside blended with Vermont’s artisanal spirit. These handmade crocks, available in two distinct stoneware finishes, reflect the calming hues of nature and the timeless art of wheel-thrown pottery. Perfect for any kitchen looking to add a touch of rustic beauty, each crock is designed to be a treasured piece in your home, blending form and function for generations to come.” —Van Gogh’s Lover: A Novel by Michael Hetzer I want to first begin by thanking TSLL long-time reader and member Christine for recommending this book to our community. Knowing that art and of course France are frequent subjects of interest, this title is definitely one I think many will enjoy. Released eaerlier this year, Van Gogh’s Lover is inspired by the true story of Vincent Van Gogh’s years in France. The plot begins twelve years after “a high school accident derailed Jane’s once-promising future. When the owners of the powerful Firth Gallery invite Jane to bring her beloved family painting, The Lover, to Switzerland, it looks like a second chance. But on her first night in Geneva, the painting goes missing, and she suspects the Firths.” “Determined to recover her painting, Jane is led to a dying village in the high Alps where an enigmatic man living in a château is waiting for her. Within the château’s walls, she uncovers a history of lies, murder, and, at its heart, an appalling injustice that will shake the art world to its core.” “But not everyone wants these facts brought to light. Jane will need to find the strength she lost in her accident and face the shocking truth about her past, her painting, and, finally, an epic love affair between a destitute painter named Vincent Van Gogh and a mysterious woman who inspired a portrait that may be his greatest work.” Shopping —Banana Republic’s Friends & Family Event, 40% off full priced purchase Beginning today (12th) and running through the 21st, enjoy 40% off any full priced purchase. Yep, including the new arrivals. I have shopped a few items below to get us started. ~SHOP THE SALE: —Flattered Bon Bon Leather and Suede Loafers, many colors While putting the finishing touches on TSLL’s forthcoming 4th book, which will include a reference to the four seasons and wardrobe must-haves (along with many other seasonal sharings and life inspiration), I also made sure to include brands worth investing in. Enter à la Flattered. Their loafers offer supple leather, a streamlined style, and classic design and colors. Recommended by a variety of top fashion editors, if you are on the hunt for a pair of loafers, you have just found them. —Kaai’s Pyramid tote, many colors Another quality purchase – Kaai’s Pyramid tote. If you are a frequent traveler carrying oodles of items in your tote, or when you head to work each day, you carry your life with you, the Pyramid tote has a spot for just about everything so you can easily find what you are looking for. I learned about this brand while reading the article “Can a bag make you more organized?”[FT.com, gift link], and quickly wanted to know the answer to the posed question. —Me + Em’s White Nautical Stripe Relaxed Forever Shirt A classic with a touch of modern subtle style. —RSVP Paris’s Parachute medium tote, cognac (more colors and different sizes) One more tote that while an investment, if it is your style, will be a trusted and dependable tote for many years to come. The subtle slouch totes are quite popular at the moment, and so long as they provide the structure and the storage paired with comfort to swing over your shoulder, I will take note. RSVP Paris’ parachute appears to check all the boxes. —Varley’s Enrico Knit Jacket, three colors available Autumn is for all intents and purposes, has technically arrived here in Bend, and this knit jacket with flattering collar (and thus warmth when needed but only when needed) with its zipped front looks to be a go-to item to elevate a casual outfit. —Varley’s Tomlinson Belted Long Coat This coat has been getting a lot of buzz as of late, and for good reason. For fewer than $500, a timeless houndstooth (puppytooth, technically) long coat. Not a bad price if it fits your silhouette, and I think it just might fit even thos of us who are tall! Made with double-faced, unlined Melton fabric, it would be a wonderful autumn coat as we transition from cool to colder temps. —Vince scarves, various fabrics Light cotton gauze or sheer wool fabric, the simple color choices to flatter your skin tone, choose a solid or a stripe, and this accessory will be with you for years. Television —77th Primetime Emmy Awards, CBS When the Primetime Emmy Award show arrives, we know that the fall season on television is about to kick off officially. And on Sunday at 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern), the 77th annual show takes place. Cue the premieres of just about every returning and new show to begin in the days and weeks to come. —High Potential, season 2 (US version) ABC/Hulu Speaking of which, the mystery series adapted from the original French series HPI (Haut Potentiel Intellectuel) – which by the way you can watch on Hulu as well!, is returning for a second season. High Potential premieres Tuesday September 16th on ABC/Hulu. Having watched a the latest season (4th) of the French version (there are five seasons so far – the fifth is being developed right now), I am curious to know if the American version will follow the same storyline for its main characters. We will see! We will see! Have a look at the trailer below. —The Morning Show, season 4 – AppleTV+ And after two years, The Morning Show is back! And boy, does it look to be high drama scene after scene! Whoa! This year Marion Cottilard and William Jackson Harper join the season for a couple of episodes and Jeremy Irons stars in season 4 as Alex Levy’s (Jennifer Aniston’s) father. Wednesday evenings are booked! Have a look at the trailer below and enjoy 10 episodes, taking us all the way to middle of November. The rain came, continued to fall, gushed, created temporary ponds in the roads and roundabouts, then Mother Nature gave us a day of sunshine before cuing the rain’s return. As many will have guessed, the happy dances at Le Papillon were in full swing! So happy am I that we are now tuckered as Nelle demonstrates above. But tuckered in a very good way ☺️. With the weather as it was, the encouragement to stay inside after our walks, meant quite a bit of work occurred on the fourth book, and as I put in the last few sections that after two months away from the book this summer, I realized the book would absolutely do well to have, we’re getting close to done. And that feels amazing. 😌 Last weekend a new family member for the garden was planted, a tree I thought I would have to wait until spring to plant, but it sort of plopped into my lap and I couldn’t say no. I will be sure to share exactly what and where it is in the Garden post later this month, and TOP Tier members can look for the monthly Ponderings . . . post to be shared this weekend. We will be talking about all sorts of stuff including the beginning steps on the Guest Bedroom project. Now that the peaches have been made into jam after sharing the rest with the neighbors, weekends shift away from garden projects (although soon, soon! the cottage gate will be installed!) and into home and life projects which coordinates well with the seasonal shift. Wearing my first scarf on a walk this week, the Outfits of the Month post is full of five outfits taking inspiration from the British while we bring on the layers for fall. And on Monday, Part Trois (3) of What Lies at the Heart of Living Simply Luxuriously was shared as we talked about savoring the everyday ‘sides’ of living well. And before I sign off and send you exploring the links below, check out this photo by enrollee of TSLL’s Intro to French Cooking class. Cassandra knocked it out of the park with her Tian de Légumes didn’t she? Yep, included in the Lesson all about “Vegetable Sides as Decadent as a Sauce”, throughout the course, students are encouraged to share what they create, and I so appreciate her sending her pics! I am hungry now ☺️ Keep them coming everyone! And don’t forget that there are 12 more days to save 20% off the regular price of enrollment for active TOP Tier members! Cassandra’s Tian de Légumes!

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response.

Title: Forbes Daily: What’s Behind Larry Ellison’s Unprecedented Wealth Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/09/11/forbes-daily-whats-behind-larry-ellisons-unprecedented-wealth-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T11:58:59Z

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Larry Ellison is coming for Elon Musk’s crown as the world’s richest person. The Oracle chairman became nearly $100 billion richer Wednesday—the biggest single-day gain ever—as shares of the cloud computing giant rallied. Ellison briefly became the second-ever person to cross the $400 billion mark, before falling back down to $388 billion by late afternoon. Oracle’s stock surged 36%, largely on the company’s projection that cloud infrastructure revenue, primarily to power AI, will skyrocket. There’s a key reason Ellison benefits so much from Oracle’s gain: stock buybacks, which the company has spent $142 billion on since 2011. As a result, Ellison’s stake nearly doubled to 41% in that time. Conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk died at age 31 on Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk was a prominent voice in culture wars on college campuses and hosted a popular daily radio show and podcast. Utah and federal law enforcement authorities are still searching for the shooter as of Thursday morning, after two people were detained and later released. MORE: The fatal shooting drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers and public figures, with President Donald Trump saying that nobody “understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Kirk,” while California Governor Gavin Newsom said the killing was “sick and reprehensible,” adding that he admired Kirk’s “passion and commitment to debate.” The buy-now, pay-later hype has made its way to Wall Street, as Swedish firm Klarna surged in its IPO on Wednesday. The company, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $52, up 30% from its IPO price, is the first of three high-profile fintech firms aiming to go public this week. In a surprisingly positive development in the fight against inflation, wholesale prices fell in August after Wall Street expected an increase, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a note, Comerica Bank’s chief economist Bill Adams said wholesalers and retailers have been “slow to pass on the costs of tariffs” to consumers—but President Donald Trump celebrated the report while reiterating calls for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. Melinda French Gates announced Wednesday at the Forbes Power Women’s Summit that she is backing a $100 million partnership to address women’s health, targeting long-underfunded research on conditions like cardiovascular disease, women’s mental health and autoimmune disorders. The need is clear: Just 1% of global health research beyond cancer focuses on conditions unique to women. The succession battle over the future of FOX and News Corp came to an end this week, and 94-year-old Rupert Murdoch’s wish to leave control of the trust that holds his family’s $8.1 billion combined stake in the two media giants to his son, Lachlan, will be fulfilled. Lachlan’s two siblings, Elisabeth and James Murdoch, and his oldest half-sibling, Prudence MacLeod, will be bought out—which should let them each walk away with about $1.4 billion. Jared Kushner’s brother Josh has been one of the most active investors in AI through his firm Thrive Capital, and now Jared is getting in on the action by cofounding AI startup Brain Co. The firm, which aims to help big corporations and governments use AI to improve their operations, announced Wednesday it had emerged from stealth and raised $30 million in its Series A funding round. South Korean nationals who were detained after a raid on a Hyundai plant in Georgia last week were released early on Thursday, a day later than initially planned, as South Korean officials claimed that President Donald Trump “wanted to explore whether they could stay in the U.S. to continue working and training American workers.” However, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun turned down the offer, saying the detained individuals were “extremely shocked and exhausted.” As ICE ramps up for an agent hiring surge, the agency has acquired a slew of new armor, drones and weaponry, records show. The military-grade gear ranges from Glock handguns to an AI-powered drone for “surveillance,” as the Trump Administration has promised to carry out more mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. The U.S. job market just got a big rewrite. On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than previously thought—the largest downward revision on record. The timing isn’t ideal, as the agency itself has been under fire. President Donald Trump accused former commissioner Erika McEntarfer of manipulating data during the 2024 election and has said the BLS “rigged” its numbers. He replaced her with Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, a move Democrats condemned. But the explanation for the correction has to do with small businesses. Nonfarm payrolls (the proper name for the official monthly jobs number) aren’t an actual count of every worker. It’s a survey of employers. The BLS asks firms how many people are on their payrolls. The survey then gets adjusted to try to capture the parts of the labor market the survey misses. Introduced in 2003, the birth-death model uses historical patterns to estimate how many new firms are likely opening or closing each month. It works well in normal times. But not all times are normal. And for the last two years, it has looked out of step with reality. Census Bureau data show that before 2020, Americans were filing about 300,000 new business applications a month. The number was steady for years, but then the pandemic hit. Since then, filings have averaged more than 400,000 a month. Some months have been higher. People want to work from home, and more are willing to try entrepreneurship. New tools, including AI, make it easier to start. WHY IT MATTERS “The jobs report is one of the most watched economic indicators,” says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. “Big revisions shake confidence in the numbers and can move markets. They also provide fodder for political fights. Understanding what drives the revisions can help you make sense of the noise.” MORE Forget BLS. Here’s How To Take The Economy’s Temperature Without Using Government Data Amazon’s robotaxi unit Zoox is now offering free rides to the public in Las Vegas, as it aims to compete with the autonomous ride-hail service from Alphabet’s Waymo. It’s a big step for the company, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020: Five: The number of locations around the city that Zoox vehicles will pick up and drop off passengers $1.2 billion: The price Amazon paid to acquire Zoox The end of 2024: When Zoox started building up its fleet of robotaxis at a 220,000-square-foot factory in California As the job market continues to weaken, young people are feeling the effects the most. But to stand out in a crowded field, consider skipping LinkedIn and instead opt for the niche job boards where recruiters actually hunt. Rewrite your résumé for each role, and be sure to share your salary expectations with prospective employers up front—especially if you’re short on time. Uber will offer a few unconventional rides starting next year after its acquisition of a firm for $125 million. Which of the following is one of the types of vehicles that users will be able to ride in? A. Boat B. Seaplane C. Motorcycle D. Bus Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price. His portfolio also includes “Magnificent Seven” stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater’s assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman’s ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company’s shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm’s principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw’s flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments. Tudor Investment Corp., which manages $17 billion in assets, gained a modest 6.5% last year, and its macro-focused founder is cautioning investors about what he views as an overheated stock market and the underlying dangers of artificial intelligence. In an op-ed he wrote for Time in June, Jones cited the rising unemployment rate for recent college graduates and said, “As someone who has spent nearly half a century as a professional risk manager, every alarm bell in my being is ringing.” Two Sigma’s two founders have a strained relationship that boiled into the open when a 2023 SEC filing disclosed that they were “unable to reach agreement on a number of topics.” But the quant hedge fund is still a powerhouse with $60 billion in assets under management. Overdeck and Siegel stepped back from their co-CEO roles last year to become co-chairmen of the firm, but Overdeck returned to its management committee earlier this year.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Uber Stock Drives Higher; CVS Slides

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher as markets kicked off a new trading week. Inflation is likely to remain in focus as investors look toward Thursday's release of the latest Consumer Price Index data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% to a record closing high, and the Dow ended 0.3% higher. Shares of video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) surged 3.8% to reach an all-time high and secure the top daily performance in the S&P 500 after the company launched its latest professional basketball game and announced plans to develop a college basketball game. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares drove 3.7% higher after it announced plans with self-driving technology firm Momenta to begin testing autonomous vehicles in Munich, Germany, in 2026. The company also moved to sell $2.25 billion in investment-grade bonds, Bloomberg reported, with the proceeds directed toward general corporate purposes. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) added 3.2%, extending strong gains late last week after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings. A surge in artificial intelligence revenue underpinned the strong performance, and Broadcom said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new client, which reports said could be OpenAI. CVS Health (CVS) shares dropped 4.8%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, after top executives at a Morgan Stanley investor conference did not offer new financial forecasts or updates on the federal government's impending release of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans, which could have a significant impact on revenue CVS derives from plans operated through its Aetna insurance business. One of the executives speaking at the conference reportedly stressed CVS has a policy of not updating its guidance between quarterly earnings releases. Shares of alcoholic beverage maker Brown-Forman (BF.B) fell 4.6%. The stock has been trending downward since the Jack Daniel's parent last month posted a lower-than-expected profit. The company noted a negative impact from the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The company said it also faces headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the potential for price pressure related to oversupply in the American whiskey market. Including Monday's decline, Brown-Forman shares have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) announced a plan to offer around $3.25 billion in senior and exchangeable notes, as well as launch a registered direct offering of ordinary shares. The former adds to the company's debt levels, while the latter dilutes the ownership stake of existing stockholders. Shares of the cruise operator sank 4.4% on Monday.

Reviews ethics statement Use these Alexa commands to manage your life without lifting a finger. These voice commands make Alexa the ultimate sidekick. Alexa has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple voice assistant for setting reminders and playing music. After 11 years, it finally got a significant upgrade with the introduction of Alexa Plus. This new iteration is powered by advanced AI, making the assistant smarter, more conversational, and, for the first time, proactive. With Alexa Plus, the assistant can manage your smart devices, organize a dynamic calendar, control your Fire TV, and even follow you from one speaker to another as you move through your home. This deeper integration makes for a more seamless user experience. If you haven't used Alexa in a while, its new commands are designed to keep up with the demands of a busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $20 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa Plus aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies. Robinhood’s inclusion validates a maturing, retail-first fintech that happens to have crypto in its product mix; it pulls another crypto-adjacent revenue stream directly into America’s most-tracked benchmark without making a call on any single token. By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.
