Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury trend-setter, Strategy, has resumed its relentless quest for accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) after a brief pause during the first week of this month.

Strategy now holds over 600,000 BTC, further solidifying its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), disclosed in a Monday 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had snagged an additional 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin between July 7 and July 14.
