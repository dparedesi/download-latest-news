Title: Tesla gets approval to start offering robotaxi rides in California as stock bounces back

Tesla moved one step closer to its goal of operating a fleet of autonomous robotaxis on Tuesday when California regulators granted Elon Musk’s electric car maker a license to begin offering rides in the state. The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit “does not authorize them to provide rides” in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public. Instead, the limited license issued by the California Public Utilities Commission grants Tesla permission to transport its employees using Tesla-owned vehicles on a prearranged basis. Tesla’s stock — which has been hammered with weeks of punishing losses that have slashed its value by nearly half — rose by nearly 4% as of 1:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. While this authorization is an initial move toward Tesla’s long-term goal of deploying a fleet of self-driving cars, it is just one of many approvals the company will need before the technology will be available to the public in California. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, remains the only company offering autonomous rides to the public in California. Its erstwhile competitor, Cruise, previously offered self-driving taxi services primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, but a series of accidents involving the vehicles prompted state regulators to suspend its permit in late 2023. More than a year later, Cruise’s parent company General Motors decided to discontinue its investment in the robotaxi program after spending over $10 billion since acquiring it in 2016. Tesla has long been seen as a potential major contender in the autonomous vehicle industry. Musk has expressed confidence in the financial impact of robot taxis, stating that they could add trillions of dollars to Tesla’s market valuation. Despite optimism over the company’s autonomous driving ambitions, Tesla’s stock has faced recent struggles. Tesla was the beneficiary of a post-election “Trump bump” when its stock price soared to an all-time high of almost $480 per share in mid-December. But Musk’s active role in slashing the federal bureaucracy and his proximity to President Trump as well as his touting of far-right parties in Europe have put a dent in the company’s sales. Since mid-December, Tesla’s stock has lost nearly 60% of its value. As of Wednesday afternoon, it was trading at around $235 per share. Musk’s embrace of MAGA politics has also sparked a rash of vandalism and arson attacks against Tesla vehicles and car dealerships nationwide in recent weeks. In October, the company unveiled a prototype of its anticipated autonomous vehicle, which Musk refers to as a “Cybercab.” Just a month later, Tesla submitted an application for the newly granted ride service permit. However, the company has not yet applied for the additional regulatory approvals necessary to operate a commercial robot taxi service in the state. Musk has suggested that Texas could be the first location where Tesla deploys its robot taxis — with a potential launch as early as June. Unlike California, Texas has relatively relaxed regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles, making it a more favorable environment for initial testing. In December 2021, Tesla officially moved its corporate headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas, after Musk bitterly criticized California regulators for imposing closures on factories during the pandemic. Waymo has already introduced its own self-driving taxis to the public in Austin this month, signaling increasing competition in the sector. For Tesla to legally operate autonomous taxis on public roads in California, the company must obtain additional approvals from both the CPUC and the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. The CPUC oversees ride-for-hire services like Uber and Lyft while the DMV is responsible for evaluating vehicle safety — a significant regulatory hurdle for any company seeking to introduce self-driving technology. Tesla has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny over its safety record — particularly as it pertains to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Last fall, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation after an incident in which a Tesla driver who had been using FSD — the advanced driver assistance system that enables semi-autonomous driving on highways and city streets — struck and killed a pedestrian.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Liquid Mercury, a renowned provider of professional crypto trading and digital asset marketplaces, has announced a strategic partnership with dVIN Labs to launch an investment-grade wine trading platform collaboratively. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury provide a mechanism capable of powering the global order book for trading tokenized wine on the dVIN Protocol. With its design, the dVIN protocol seeks to leverage a combination of data, DePIN, DeFi, and tokenization to bring wine on-chain. Notably, dVIN’s mission to revolutionize the wine industry with blockchain-powered transparency and unified liquidity aligns greatly with Liquid Mercury’s decision to debut wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors. dVIN is a great fit for this partnership because it can solve the authenticity, verification, and provenance challenges that have relegated wine investment to an inefficient, niche activity that appeals to the well-connected uber-wealthy. David Garrett, co-founder and co-CEO of dVIN, commented on the partnership, saying, “The $300 billion investment-grade wine market is ready to be exposed to new investors and to become a liquid, tradable asset.” “Our goal is to make investing in wine as easy and efficient as investing in your favorite stock, cryptocurrency, or other favorite asset. We chose Liquid Mercury as our partner to create a liquid, global marketplace because our expertise in the wine market is matched by their team’s expertise in financial markets, laying the groundwork to unlock this exciting new digital asset class,” he added. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury, and dVIN join efforts to release a platform that will unify previously fragmented liquidity and turn investment-grade wine into a scalable asset class with democratized tools and access for retail investors and institutions alike. Furthermore, Liquid Mercury will provide white-labeled platforms for dVIN channel partners to onboard individual investors. These investors can gain instant access to wine from their favorite winemakers and exclusive wines held at bonded warehouses around the world. Also, Liquid Mercury will provide support for the dVIN global order book, which aggregates regional marketplaces and utilizes trading technology purpose-built to get the best price for buyers and sellers. Liquid Mercury CEO Tony Saliba also commented on the development saying; “Liquid Mercury is thrilled to partner with dVIN to unlock wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors…Our thesis for real-world assets has been that investing in culture is a powerful secular trend, and we know our battle-tested technology can reliably power new digital marketplaces, so we see massive potential in this partnership.”

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.

Title: Gensol fast-charged Blu-Smart. But their ties are a governance puzzle

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: On 16 January, Refex Industries Ltd, a manufacturer of refrigerant gases, informed the stock exchanges that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Refex Green Mobility, had agreed to buy 2,997 electric cars from Gensol Engineering Ltd. Refex Green Mobility would take over Gensol’s existing loan of ₹315 crore as part of this transaction. Gensol Engineering Ltd also informed the same to the exchanges. Shares of Refex ended 1.6% higher the next day, while shares of Gensol remained unchanged. This transaction came under the spotlight after Gensol, a solar engineering, procurement and electric vehicle (EV) financing company, saw two rating agencies downgrade its borrowing to default earlier this month. Rating agency Icra even said Gensol is falsifying statements. Gensol denies any wrongdoing and claims that this sale should help reduce its debt, from ₹1,146 crore to ₹831 crore. So, why is there a problem? Many unanswered questions linger, particularly around the company’s ties with the privately held Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd, the electric cab-hailing service. Blu-Smart was co-founded by Anmol Singh Jaggi; the 39-year-old is also the chairman and managing director of Gensol. In Gensol’s EV financing business, the company buys cars and then leases them to other companies. Gensol acknowledges that it owns 2,997 EVs that are part of Blu-Smart’s fleet. But that’s not the complete story—Blu-Smart’s fleet consists of 8,000 cars and Gensol, according to people Mint spoke to, owns a meaty share of this number. While Gensol didn’t disclose the overall number of cars it owns, and the number it leased to Blu-Smart, a spokesperson for Blu-Smart stated that multiple lessors lease out vehicles to the ride hailing company. According to two investors courted by Blu-Smart, two board members, and one proxy advisory firm executive, Gensol’s lack of transparency about its close ties with the cab-hailing company, particularly around the money spent on cars and loans granted, raises questions around Gensol’s corporate governance practices. Essential details, including the terms of lease partnerships, remain shrouded in mystery. Above all, a Mint investigation reveals that Gensol’s balance sheet has been used to build Blu-Smart’s business even as the cab-hailing company continues to be a privately owned one. Mint reviewed Gensol and Blu-Smart’s financials, including an investment proposal made by the electric cab-hailing service to prospective investors in October last year. We also spoke with seven executives to piece together this story. Growing togetherJaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. View Full Image A file photo of Anmol Singh Jaggi, CMD of Gensol and co-founder, Blu-Smart. (Mint) First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. View Full Image Blu-Smart EVs being charged at a charging hub in Bengaluru. The loansGensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company. The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Jaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. View Full Image Blu-Smart EVs being charged at a charging hub in Bengaluru. The loansGensol buys cars, leases them to Blu-Smart, and tops it up with more loans to the private cab-hailing company. The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore).

The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. The close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart.
