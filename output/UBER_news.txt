Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Cecilia Lallmann Cecilia Lallmann Leave your feedback Maybe your resolution for 2026 is to pay down debt, start your retirement savings, or save for a big ticket item. Maybe you need help with personal finance but don't know where to start. Either way, prioritizing your goals for the New Year comes down to understanding what you value the most, Kumiko Love, an accredited financial counselor and author of "My Money, My Way," told PBS News. That's because, in "the world of finance, everything is a trade off," Love said. WATCH: Should you use a buy now, pay later loan? Here's what to know Of the 30% of Americans who say they make at least one resolution, 61% say they are focused on money or finances, according to Pew Research. And a majority of Americans – 87% – say they accomplish at least some of their annual resolutions. To Love, mapping out small wins along the way can help you stay the course. "What we need to be doing is celebrating all the consistent habits and actions and mindset that we're doing to get us there," Love said. "The honest truth is we live more in our day-to-day than at our end results." To help you set yourself up for financial success this year, PBS News asked experts for tips on reaching different financial goals. Fear around your money "most of the time comes from the unknown," Love said. "You're not scared of looking at your money. You're actually nervous and stressed out because you have no idea what's going on with your money," echoed Tori Dunlap, a self-taught money and career expert who founded the financial education platform Her First 100K. "We can't make changes unless we actually know what's going on, unless we know where our money's going." "Paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." When you sit down to look at the numbers, "rewire all of that shame and the fear and the guilt you feel," suggested Dunlap, author of "Financial Feminist. The first step to that is "looking at your money in the most neutral way possible and just figuring out, 'OK, what am I gonna do to fix the things that aren't working and continue doing the things that are?'" There are also resources for people who need support. "The most important thing in this day and time is that if you feel overwhelmed, if you feel burdened, that you reach out and say, 'I need help,'" said Michelle Singletary, personal finance columnist at The Washington Post. She suggests looking into personal finance classes or community programs, or finding an accountability partner. "Maybe there's somebody in your life who's really good with money" who you can ask to help you on your personal finance journey, Singletary said. Love wants people to understand that "paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." She said if you don't learn the healthy habits to stay out of debt, "you can pay off debt but go right back into debt again." So the first step of what she calls a "debt payoff journey" is to understand "why you're in debt in the first place." "This is not a blame game," Love said. "This is simply understanding how you got here so you can set better management and healthy habits to maybe correct some of those things and or make different choices." WATCH: Why it's getting harder to find a new car under $25,000 High-interest debt should be the first kind you should tackle. "Credit card debt always is going to have a high interest rate. That's probably the debt you need to work to eliminate first before you worry about your lesser interest debt," Dunlap said. If you have multiple credit cards with different interest rates, start with the one with the highest interest rate. Dunlap also suggests "looking "into a personal loan to help consolidate your debt, especially if you have a lot of debt at a higher interest rate and it's not going down." "The thing with credit cards is that the interest compounds. It's very high and it compounds every day," Dunlap told PBS News. "So, every day you spend in debt, it gets more expensive. Personal loans allow you to typically take out a loan at a lower interest rate with one single monthly payment that isn't going to compound every day." The personal loan route to pay off high-interest credit card debt can be "a nice reset for your money." Dunlap said the strategy for paying off your student loan debt depends on what kind of loans they are and what the interest rate is. If you have multiple sources of debt, federal student loans can be your last priority since there are other options for repayment, Love said. You may qualify for an income-based repayment plan that could help give you "some breathing room" to focus on whatever debt is most eating into your cash flow and destroying your budget, she added. Dunlap shared what she calls the "7 to 8% rule." If the interest rate on your student loan debt is more than 7 to 8%, then it costs you more money to be in debt, so you should pay it off faster. Put extra money into the principle so your interest is calculated off of a smaller balance. If the interest rate is less than that, Dunlap recommends sticking with monthly payments and focusing on investing any extra income instead. If you have private student loans at a high interest rate, Dunlap said it might be worth refinancing, but she said "do not take your federal loans private." "That takes you out of potential student loan forgiveness in the future," Dunlap said, and won't allow you to get on an income-based repayment plan. "Investing should not be sexy," Dunlap said. "It should be safe, consistent, and over a long period of time." She said day trading or picking "a hot stock" is very risky. The first place to start when investing is using your retirement account to its full advantage, both Dunlap and Love said. "Investing should not be sexy." "People don't understand that retirement accounts like a 401k or an IRA are investing accounts and they're tax advantaged, meaning that the government is incentivizing you to save for your retirement by offering you tax breaks," Dunlap said. Plus, a lot of employer sponsored plans offer a match as part of your benefits package, Love said. "It's like free money" you can use to invest. But, Dunlap said to remember to choose your investments. Otherwise, you'll spend "years in what I call financial purgatory," Dunlap said. Dunlap recommends " something like an index fund, which is a group of stocks" that is "well diversified." Love said if you want more specific advice, you'll typically "have access to the financial advisor that is managing" your retirement account on whatever platform you use. "If you have questions, reach out to them. That's what they're there for," Love said Love stressed that while she is an accredited financial counselor, she is not a fiduciary. So her advice shouldn't take the place of recommendations from an adviser with specific information about your assets. But there are three steps that come to mind for how you could begin "upping your retirement game." First, "start with your [employer] match." Then, if you want to go above and beyond, "I would move to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax bracket and where you're gonna be in retirement." And then "I [would] look at something called a health savings account," where individuals can set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. Love recommends looking into an HSA because it's a triple tax-advantage account, since you can contribute to it before taxes, earn interest on the account tax-free, and withdrawals are not taxed as long as they're used for qualifying medical expenses. Since the funds don't expire and continue to roll over year after year, "it turns into quite a retirement account when you become of age for retirement." Dunlap said if you are nearing retirement, you can contribute more money through a "catch-up contribution," which varies based on the account. She recommends looking into what type of retirement account you currently have and what the catch-up contribution is if you're looking to save more as you get closer to retirement age. Before you think about the financial part of homeownership, the first question you should ask yourself is "is this something you want to do or just something that you were told to do?'" Dunlap said "Renting is not throwing away money. You are paying a fee to live in a place and also a convenience fee where somebody else is gonna handle any problems that come up," Dunlap said. She said homeownership comes with many more expenses than just the down payment and monthly mortgage, and you should ask yourself if you're ready to pay for everything that could come up. READ MORE: Is the 30% rule for rent still relevant? Here's what experts think Some expenses to consider include property taxes, emergency repairs, possibly a homeowners association fee and property insurance. So, "the second question is, can I afford to do this?" Dunlap said. If the answer is yes, Love said you need to determine how much to save, which "starts with understanding what you want to buy." "Until you know how much house you can afford and what you want, it's really hard to start the planning process," Love said. Love said some of the questions to ask yourself when determining your budget include: "Are you buying a fixer upper? Are you buying something that you're going to only live in temporarily for a short amount of time under five years? Are you buying your forever home? How big do you want it? Do you still want to extend your family? Because then you have to think if it's going to be your forever home, you better make sure it's big enough." Dunlap suggested using a high-yield savings account to use as a place to save the money you will use for a down payment, and to automate contributions so it's easier to meet your monthly goal. If you want to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, the easiest way to do this is by having 20% of the home price for the down payment. If you're like the 80% of buyers who financed their home purchase in 2024, you will want to think about how to improve your credit score to get a better mortgage interest rate, Dunlap said. And don't forget about an emergency fund, Love said. You can also use the questions you asked yourself at the beginning to determine how much to save for house maintenance. As soon as you know an estimated total for the purchase, you can start a sinking fund, where you save a small amount from each paycheck for a planned expense. This should be separate from your emergency fund, which should only be used for unplanned expenses. Both Dunlap and Love say the easiest way to determine your monthly savings goal is to take the amount and divide it by however many months you have to save. If you do this and the amount is unrealistic, Dunlap said, you should pick a different destination, a more affordable item or give yourself more time to save, if you can move the date. In 2025, more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. were laid off, according to the career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. When trying to make up for lost income, Love said, "lean in on the skills that you possess" and "get on places like Upwork where you can work for yourself." You may feel like you are overqualified to drive for Uber, but you could be surprised and make way more than you thought you could, Love said. Places like Upwork can also connect you with temporary gigs that match your skillset. Dunlap said a high-yield savings account can come in handy during this time. Even small contributions could return $20 to 40 a month, compared to the few dollars you'd get in annual interest with a traditional account. It's also a good time to make a sustainable budget. Like a car gas gauge, "budgets tell you how far you can get," Dunlap said. "Knowing what's going in and going out, and allowing your budget to adjust accordingly is one of the ways we get control during a very uncontrollable situation." Also, "remind yourself that this season is temporary," Love said, and give yourself grace. More than half of the U.S. workforce in 2024 were paid hourly rates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . These workers tend to have less predictable paychecks compared to salaried workers. If your income fluctuates, the first step is to know the minimum amount of money you need to make each month to meet the basics. (Love calls this a "bare bones budget"; for Dunlap, it's the "ramen noodle number.") Start with a revolving checking or savings account, where you'll deposit your checks or tips. "Pay yourself" your bare bones budget from this account to cover your monthly expenses. If there is extra money left, leave it in the revolving account so you can make up for expenses when you don't meet your bare bones budget in other months. Love recommends having at least one month of bare bones expenses in the revolving account. Keeping the baseline in the account can help stabilize your cash flow. Gradually, "you can start giving yourself more for more wants" as you continue to build up this account, Love said. If you make more money than you expect, Dunlap suggests going through a "financial priority list" for that extra income. "Contribute to your emergency fund," Dunlap said. If you already have three to six months of living expenses tucked away, pay off credit card debt and then "contribute more to your retirement accounts," Dunlap said.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

“Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others.” —Pema Chodron 2026 is the 250th anniversary of our country’s conception. A few years later when the Constitution was ratified, we became a republic — “if you can keep it,” Ben Franklin cracked to anxious citizens waiting outside the great hall in Philadelphia. Our country was predicated on the resolve of virtuous men operating under the rule of law. We are lately under an astounding siege of villains without principle seeking to wreck the republic. The big question facing the USA is whether our political life can become even more deranged than it has been in the past ten years, or can we possibly sober up. How is it we’re still arguing about men in women’s locker rooms? The self-evident has gone missing. A lot has gone very wrong. The Woke-Jacobin war against our country continues, led by a Democratic Party made even more vicious, depraved, and insane by the 2024 election victory of Mr. Trump, who was left a broken polity after the four-year tableau vivant of “Joe Biden.” Can our nation recover its balance, its sense of purpose, its traction in history? Can we reconstruct a coherent common culture that will afford us some means to carry on as an upright people? I will try to answer without wasting pixels. Hijacking the Law Nothing is more urgent than cleaning up the machinery of our elections. It is overloaded now with deliberately devious complexities that invite fraud. We must put an end to mail-in ballots with the sole exception of traditional absentee ballots for citizens out of the country on election day, with proof. We must eliminate all electronic interfaces between the vote and the tally, including all ballot-counting hardware, and return to paper ballots tallied by human beings. We must require voter ID, proof of citizenship, and proof of local voting-district residence. Automatic motor-voter registration must end. Ballots must be cast on election day only (absentee ballots must be received by election day) and the results reported out in twenty-four hours. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication.

But, understand that an industry has evolved to take full advantage of that. It’s personified by the Democratic Party-allied lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, who played a significant role in the legal expansion of mail-in voting that led up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Democracy Docket org is funded by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, associated NGOs (the Hopewell Fund, the North Fund) used as pass-throughs for the Arabella Fund, the MacArthur Foundation, and the David Rockefeller Fund. In 2021, Marc Elias founded the Elias Law Group after leaving Perkins Coie, the Washington DC power firm that played a significant role in the RussiaGate crimes centered around Hillary Clinton’s Steele Dossier. At Perkins Coie, in advance of the 2020 election, Elias was extensively involved in challenging, litigating, influencing, and re-engineering state election laws and advised on “dark money” strategies for Democratic voter “outreach” (that is, ballot-harvesting). It was all meticulously gamed-out beforehand by an NGO called the Transition Integrity Project founded by Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center. The objective: to maximize opportunities for improper balloting. After the 2020 election, Marc Elias defended the suspicious results from counties in swing states against Trump campaign lawsuits (winning 64 of 65 cases on specious grounds). The last thing Marc Elias has been interested in is election integrity. His focus is strictly on winning elections for the Democratic Party by any means necessary. The war cry about “defending democracy” is the exact opposite of what the lawfare ninjas actually do. Through 2025, Congress has entertained election reform bills, most recently, the SAVE Act (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility), which has languished on the House side for months awaiting deliberation in the Senate. Prediction: Mr. Trump will turn up the heat on Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to expedite passage of election reform. This partly depends on the dark business now occurring in Venezuela, which is the suspected hub of a global election rigging apparatus engineered around Dominion / Smartmatic technology. Prediction: Marc Elias will be indicted for activities related to election fraud. Norm Eisen is the point man for Democratic party Lawfare, which is warfare against the citizens of the USA by means of the courts. Eisen is affiliated with the Brookings Institution and the States United Democracy Center, which is supported by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation and activist orgs associated with Arabella Advisors, a hub fueled by dark money. He was an active participant in the Transition Integrity Project of 2020. Norm Eisen’s general mission for years is to drain the resources of the Democratic Party’s political opponents in frivolous lawsuits — working in partnership with Democratic activist judges — and to overburden the federal court dockets to paralyze the working-out of our nation’s disputes. Eisen was counsel to Jerrold Nadler’s 2019 House impeachment committee and was involved in the machinations of then-Rep. Adam Schiff with CIA-agent “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella, Intel IG Michael Atkinson, and NSC staffer Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, who cooked up the Ukraine phone call scheme to impeach Mr. Trump. After “Joe Biden’s” fake election, Eisen was deeply involved in choreographing the scope and format of the House Jan-6 hearings for which the Republican minority was not allowed to choose its own committee members. The committee proceedings were arranged as a prestige docudrama TV show, under the direction of former ABC network president, James Goldstein, hired, in effect, as the producer of a show. The committee destroyed its entire evidence cache after it issued its final report. That’s how much confidence they had in their methods and findings. After that exploit, Eisen acted as a facilitator and strategist for “Joe Biden’s” DOJ in the 2024 Jack Smith Special Counsel prosecutions of Donald Trump, and acted as a go-between for the DOJ in the various New York State cases against Trump and the Fulton County, GA, case brought by DA Fani Willis. All of these actions amounted to election interference — a concerted conspiracy to eliminate Mr. Trump by putting him in prison by way of specious, malicious prosecutions — and, one way or another, they all failed to accomplish their goal. Norm Eisen and Marc Elias, along with their lawfare cohorts Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Ben Wittes should be subject to prosecution under federal criminal statutes for their wide-ranging activities, including: 18 U.S.C. § 241 (Conspiracy Against Rights); 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements); 18 U.S.C. § 594 (Intimidation of Voters). The next big hairball is the politicized judiciary, federal judges who consistently interfere in executive actions (the President), a clash between Article II and Article III of the Constitution. It amounts to Democratic Party-designated plaintiffs getting injunctions and restraining orders through partisan judges against policies issued by the White House around deportation of illegal immigrants, firings of federal employees, funding freezes, the termination of “birthright citizenship,” and more. The funding freeze and firing cases were aimed at keeping taxpayer dollars flowing out federal agencies to Democratic Party NGOs and for keeping the so-called “resistance” operators in positions of influence within government agencies at their desks and on the payroll. Many of the NGOs promote activities aimed at dismantling the government and fomenting racial animus. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite that. The president must be allowed to fire employees of the executive branch engaged in slow-motion sedition. These court rulings are choreographed by Norm Eisen’s lawfare operation which has enough money from the aforementioned NGOs and billionaire-funded foundations to bring endless lawsuits in order to gum up the works of governance. The remedy for all this is knotty. The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) has reversed many lower court rulings, but these are provisional actions, pending the SCOTUS entertaining any particular case decisively in regular session. The myriad cases end up jamming the SCOTUS docket. The net effect is to slow down policy that President Trump was elected to pursue. Federal judges can otherwise be removed only via impeachment by the US Senate, which is a practical impossibility at this time since it requires 60 out of 100 votes and the Republicans hold a mere 53 seat majority out of 100. Perhaps the best remedy is to prosecute the lawfare ninjas who are ginning up all those court cases. Their activities can be framed as a conspiracy against rights (18 U.S.C. § 241). Against whose rights? Against the rights of the people of the US to an executive that is able to discharge its Constitutional duties — to provide for the public safety, to enforce the law, and to carry out foreign policy. Norm Eisen, Marty McCord, and Andrew Weissmann might also be subject to a charge of seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 2384), as when two or more persons conspire to “levy war against the United States. And it is warfare using the mechanisms of the law. Norm Eisen is behaving like a spike protein in the nation’s bloodstream, turning the nation’s immune system, the rule of law, against the nation. Prediction: Norm Eisen and cohorts will be hiring criminal defense lawyers in 2026. Hijacking the Truth “. . . the dirty little secret is that the same people pretending to be fighting fascism are the fascists.” —Sasha Stone The American people have been increasingly subjected to a contrived permission structure that has normalized lying and deceit about everything and anything, leaving every major institution in the land damaged or wrecked. Lying has become the default position of many in authority, and no one has been held accountable for it. Medicine is wrecked due to the dishonest behavior of doctors colluding with the pharmaceutical industry and officials of the Health and Human Services agencies on the Covid-19 op — mandates, lockdowns, lying about efficacy and harms, hiding true remedies, cover-up of the origins of Covid — as well as the medical establishment’s regular ongoing “health care” racketeering operations in concert with insurance companies, hospital conglomerates, and other players. The cruelty and incompetence of these medical rackets is one thing, but the moral failure is spectacular. Medicine has forsaken the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. The many agencies under US HHS, plus the university labs, the medical journals, the state medical boards, and the mainstream media’s health reporters are all implicated in these ongoing misdeeds. Until late in 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr., was sore beset by “resistance” at the FDA, CDC, NIH, and everything else under the giant agency’s umbrella. In December, 2025, things are changing. The CDC’s ACIP vaccine advisory committee stopped recommending Hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. Then the CDC officially acknowledged that COVID-19 vaccines have caused injuries in adults, previously stonewalled. These might be signs that Mr. Kennedy is finally getting a grip on his sprawling agencies. Prediction: in 2026, expect criminal referrals against former senior management at CDC, FDA, and NIH for a range of crimes in the Covid-19 operation. In the larger picture, the whole scaffold of health care is in the process of imploding. Predictions: In 2026, doctors will increasingly bail out of big corporate practices and go freelance on a cash payment basis, leaving behind the corrupt and onerous insurance racket. Hospitals will shutter. Giant medical insurance conglomerates will go out of business. Millions will be left without coverage. Medicine will be forced to begin reorganizing on an emergent, provisional basis. The net effect will be doctors who make less money but control their own medical practices and much more limited access to specialty medicine for the general public, including now-common surgeries like joint replacement and cancer therapies. It will be most difficult for doctors to regain their authority and the esteem of their patients. Alt medical practitioners of every sort will multiply, many on the down-low evading regulation, as sick citizens desperately seek relief from illness while they navigate around the ruins of the old standard medicine. Quackery will flourish and it will be difficult for ordinary people to discern which health care services are of value and which are scams. Higher education is obviously ill. It bargained away its legitimacy by participating in the college loan racket with the equally deleterious overlay of pervasive DEI racketeering (and inevitable lowering of standards). That opened the door for grievance-oriented Marxists, and race-and-gender hustlers to take the curricula hostage — wholesale intellectual racketeering. That, in turn, led to the abolition of truth-telling for the purpose of advancing agendas. Reality on campus became purely transactional and contingent. Free speech was suppressed. All of this was supported by pusillanimous college deans and cowardly university presidents and now they are paying the price. Too many young Americans do not believe that a college degree has value, especially at the price of six-figures in debt. Most colleges and universities are not backstopped by big endowments like the big Ivy League schools and a lot of them will be going out of business in 2026. Graduate schools and PhD programs will be especially hard hit. It’s not clear what role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in paring down the numbers of candidates for certified expertise, but it’s not looking good. Any earnest young person can already find an adequate education post-secondary education on the internet, for instance the Khan Academy, a long-running, pre-AI, free website of courses from the rudimentary to the advanced. The arts and the cultural media (including news media) have been disgracing themselves frantically for years. Film production in Los Angeles dropped 63-percent in 2024 extending into 2025. The feature film is being replaced by short-format Instagram and Tiktok videos. The multiplex cinemas are empty. The theatrical exhibition of movies is on its deathbed. They can’t compete with giant flat-screens in the comfort of your home where microwaved popcorn is only a buck a bowl (compared to $32 at the cineplex.) Management of the Hollywood studios was taken hostage by race-and-gender hustlers, with permission structures engineered by financial reliance on Chinese (CCP-affiliated) investors and distributors. The result was Woke cinema, girl-boss movies, DEI-oriented storytelling, and one flop after another. The replication of streaming channels has only invoked Gresham’s Law in culture: bad content drives out good content. The next development, moving very rapidly now, is AI applied to cinema, which implies the end of the acting profession at least, and perhaps screenwriting, too. The end product is liable to be something more like an hallucination than a story told in the language of dramaturgy, following the logic of authentic human behavior. I’d expect even more corrosive effects of Gresham’s Law in the new AI regime as genuine human creativity becomes ever more mediated and abstracted from the end product. You must also wonder about the long-term prospects of the Internet as we know it. The sheer stress on the electric grid from the demands of AI suggests problems with reliable electric service in the years ahead. The whole thing begins to look like a self-limiting problem. Ten years from now, we might be back to entertaining ourselves with puppet shows. News as we knew it for much of the past 200 years is also gone missing. The remnants exist on cable channels and internet sites as a commerce in gossip, rumor, and opinion. The legacy TV news channels no longer employ reporters in the field. Even under Bari Weiss’s new management, CBS’s 60-Minutes still broadcasts rafts of mendacious propaganda each week. “X,” formerly Twitter, is a colossal grape-vine, and is now touting itself as the world’s leading news source, though it still engages in surreptitious censorship. These days, you must be your own gatekeeper (managing editor), combing through bales of crap to find the scattered gems of real news. The authoritative, trustworthy editors of yore are no more. Hardly anyone in the public arena speaks with authority, and reputations are easily assassinated by interested parties with agendas. The newspapers have made themselves pathetic jokes — The New York Times with its Pulitzer Prize for lying about RussiaGate and routine spin services for the corrupt Democratic Party. . . The Washington Post acting as publicist for nefarious cabals in and around the intel blob. Local newspapers lie dead everywhere, and hardly anyone knows what is going on in their own towns. The people are horrifically misinformed and uninformed. Don’t expect AI to make the situation any better. The years ahead may therefore be a nadir of public confusion, delusion, and generalized ignorance in societies whose complexity cannot survive such derangements. What was not so many decades ago a high trust society based on a coherent common culture and broadly agreed-upon values seems to be devolving into babel and anarchy leading eventually to a generalized social collapse. Out of that, a new consensus about reality will emergently and eventually self-organize, but it’s impossible to say how long that might take, what degree of disorder will have to be endured on the journey to resolution, and what the reorganized template for human behavior might finally look like. Humans organized in societies need the truth. They need trustworthy authorities. Authority without truth is just cruel, faithless power. The Democratic Party in our time has given you a nice demonstration of how that works. The party deserves to be put out of business. Perhaps that will begin the process of reconstructing a coherent common culture. War is Politics by Other Means “The self-described Coalition of the Willing was always little more than a public relations exercise. Today – after almost four years of bloody fighting – it is evident that the main concern of this Coalition is to limit the damage caused by its posturing.” —Frank Furedi Interested parties in the USA and the NATO deliberately started the Ukraine War in 2014 while transforming that sad-sack nation into a global money laundry. The reasons appear to have been nefarious and reckless. By Christmas 2025, Mr. Trump’s attempts to negotiate a peace had not succeeded. Even now, the big dogs of NATO make noises and idle threats about going to war with Russia. The rationale for that is preposterous, since they lack the military manpower and the armaments to prosecute such a war, and open themselves to nuclear destruction if they even attempt such a folly. The USA, at this point, has no vested interest in Ukraine. It is in everybody’s interest that the Ukraine revert to its pre-2014 condition as an uncontested frontier nation within Russia’s sphere of influence that does not make itself a pain-in-the-ass for the lands adjacent and proximate to it. It is very much in the USA’s interest to develop respectful, transactional relations with Russia a nation which, paradoxically, under Vladimir Putin, is making itself a last bastion of Western Civ while the EU nations commit economic and cultural suicide, make war on their own citizens, and beat a path to some grim, neo-medieval future. At this moment, there are three plausible endings to the Ukraine War. One is a simple armistice, a cessation of military operations, but without any formal peace settlement. That would look like the long and contentious irresolution of the Korean War, a suspended animation of hostilities at the current battle lines. A second potential outcome is a straight-up Russian victory, leaving Russia to pick up the pieces of what will be a failed state, will require Russia to take administrative control and rebuild what can be afforded, perhaps with international help, or not, and to see if Ukraine can stand on its feet as a sovereign state — understood to not be subject to outside manipulation. That is apt to be the outcome when money and arms from the West stop flowing into Ukraine, which is about exactly where things stand on New Year’s 2026. Mr. Trump appears to want out of supporting a war that Ukraine is clearly losing at this point. The EU’s option of underwriting the Ukraine war machine by confiscating Russian financial assets trapped in Europe’s banks was eight-sixed by Hungary and Belgium just after Christmas. Confiscating Russia’s sovereign wealth would have probably destroyed Europe’s bond markets and blown up the entire financial system of Western Civ. Europe’s economies are in enough trouble as it is, with industry failing, energy resources getting scarcer and less affordable, and social welfare systems under a mighty strain — not to mention the demographic fiasco of falling indigenous birthrates and the ongoing invasion of so many migrants from the global south. The third possible outcome of the Ukraine mess is that the Ukrainian people themselves will opt out of the war by getting rid of the Zelenskyy regime. Zelenskyy is already engulfed in a scandal over all the money that he and his cronies creamed off out of US and NATO financial support. Also, Ukraine has lost 10-million in population since the start of hostilities in 2022, more than a million of them soldiers killed in action. The lack of young men on the scene is an economic and demographic disaster. The Ukrainians know that Zelenskyy is a criminal as well as an incompetent war commander. They are sick of war, of carnage, of wreckage and ruin. Forecast: Zelenskyy will be ousted as president by elite Ukrainian military units before the four-year anniversary of the war’s onset in February. Ukraine then concedes the loss of its territories. . .the war ends. . . and Russia supervises an election at the earliest opportunity. The world moves on. Euroland Cracks Up Europe’s days as a tourist theme park draw to a close. A new era dawns: the Neo-medieval. The ancient competition for power and resources between language groups and geographic regions heats up again, with even fewer goodies to fight over this time around. EU-style cooperation breaks down. The Big Dogs (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) can no longer stand the grotesque over-regulation of their businesses and their energy needs. They withdraw from the EU and the union dissolves in a matter of weeks. Hard borders are reinstated. Old currencies reappear: the franc, the mark, the guilder, lira. Diplomats make frantic rounds to renegotiate trade agreements and financial arrangements, including how to deal with the many failed European banks and the broken bond markets. Skirmishes break out along contested national frontiers and the sea lanes become danger zones. Meanwhile, Europe’s people endure a severe slowdown in all business activity, loss of pensions, a broken social safety net, and a gross loss of trust in the political class. Populations grow restive. Indigenous Brits, Frenchmen, Germans, finally express their pent-up resentment with third world migrants and a movement grows to expel as many as possible back to their nations of origin. That sparks a violent response from the migrants, especially the jihad-inclined Islamists. It blossoms into medium-grade urban warfare. Militaries are called in to clean out the migrant ghettos and deport non-citizens. It is a high-tech Reconquista, but much more difficult than previous episodes on the continent, bloodier and less successful. In some localities, migrants gain the upper hand by sheer numbers. It could take decades to resolve this, if at all. There is even the possibility that some countires will be overtaken by Islam. The UK is a candidate for that. It has already shown abject submission, and it’s not going too far to imagine the Islamic population could attempt the extermination of native Britons. Many of their imams say as much out loud, one way or another, and the demoralized Brits do nothing about it If hostilities break out, I would not expect the USA to come to Europe’s rescue this time around. America is already showing signs of dissociating from Europe and NATO. It is in the NATO by-laws, for instance, that America is not obliged to defend countries that militate against support free speech, and there are already multiple aggressive censorship programs enacted around the continent. “X” was just fined $140-million by the European Commission for refusing to censor so-called “hate speech” — which is any sundry utterance that some low-level European bureaucrat deems offensive. Prediction: Macron, Merz, Starmer will be run out of office in the coming year one way or another. It will look a little like the year 1848 all over again, when revolt broke out all over the continent. The Marxists will be very active and aggressive, as ever, but they will ultimately lose. Nobody really wants to try communism again. The farmers, especially, have been in the vanguard of protest because of the EU’s onerous and idiotic regulatory regime. 1848 was mainly a revolt of urban industrial labor — the workers! Industry in 1848 was a pretty new thing at the grand scale. The deleterious effects on the laboring class came on quickly and had become too terrible to ignore. It reached a critical threshold before authorities were prepared for it. The next revolution will resolve initially into systems collapse, deep economic contraction, and continued population decline. Generalized, intractable hardship will become the new normal in Europe. Large nation states might de-consolidate, fracture into smaller autonomous regions, to keep public affairs manageable. Some regions may just get chaotic, and stay that way for a long time. Germany has only been a nation since 1871, prior to which it was a crazy-quilt of kingdoms, grand duchies, principalities, and free cities (e.g., Bremen, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Hamburg). The spectacular failure of liberal democracy in our time could easily usher in a period of autocracy — managers who can expedite problem-solving without the intercession of parliaments — and that might even mean a return to monarchy that actually rules. We thought that humanity had moved beyond that, but history is a prankster. Anyway, the USA will increasingly be an observer of all this from our remove across the Atlantic. For now, we are preoccupied with our own backyard. Return of the Monroe Doctrine A friend writes: “Trump has made the wise (and unavoidable) decision to recognize that we don’t and can’t rule the world, but we can be secure in the Western Hemisphere.” Already, under Mr. Trump, US foreign policy is recalibrating to clean up our own hemisphere — to make things a lot harder for China to surreptitiously colonize South America as a resource depot, to smash the drug cartels that are killing off Americans, bust the mafia-like governments associated with them, and aggressively discourage communist movements where they crop up. The obvious case-in-point just now is Venezuela and its long-running Chavez-to-Maduro regime, accused of hosting CCP operations, meddling in elections via internet fuckery in every place it can install Dominion / Smartmatic machines, offering a platform for Iran to antagonize the USA, expropriating US oil leases, and working hand-in-hand with Cuba’s intel services, Brazil’s Lula da Silva, and Mexico’s drug cartels to wage a new generation of warfare against the USA. Mr. Trump is going after Venezuela hard now. Don’t know how he’s going to bust up the place, exactly, but it’s coming, perhaps even without a whole lot of kinetic action. Prediction: a new government and new rules for Venezuela in 2026. US oil companies come back in and get the stuff back pumping. Venezuela gets the licensing fees, royalties, all above-board. Rule of law returns, including property law. Venezuelans can open businesses again. They send us major league baseball players instead of Tren de Agua gangsters and fentanyl. As a side effect of choking-off Venezuela, Cuba’s communist regime finally falls, too. They have depended utterly on Maduro’s oil and with the tankers blockaded, the island will soon go dark. The Castro brothers are gone. Communism, can no longer rely on their charisma. The current president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, is a nonentity. He will be overthrown in 2026, and for the first time in nearly 70 years, Cuba will be a free society. The election of Javier Milei in Argentina has turned that country back in the direction of economic liberty by severely paring down the size of parasitical government and all the racketeering associated with it that has dragged Argentina down since rise of Juan Peron and Peronism after World War Two. In October 2025, the Trump admin offered to help stabilize Argentina’s currency with a $20-billion currency swap line, conditioned on Milei’s ongoing free market reforms. His reforms will continue in 2026, lifting Argentina yet closer to its former status as one of the world’s richer nations. On December 14, 2025, Chile elected a conservative, Jose Antonio Kast, replacing the leftist government of Gabriel Boric. Kast’s election victory, with a 58-percent margin in the runoff against leftist candidate Jeannette Jara. This was a sharp rejection of Boric’s leftist administration, driven by crime, immigration, and economic dysfunction, leading to a significant rightward shift in Chilean politics. Kast’s victory aligns with a regional trend toward right-leaning leaders in Latin America, emphasizing security and migration controls. President Lula of Brazil represents an ongoing irritant to the USA. With Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, plus the Castro brothers, Lula organized the São Paulo Forum (Foro de São Paulo), a coordination platform for leftist political parties, movements, and organizations. You probably noticed that Lula’s 2020 election showed similar earmarks of fraud as “Joe Biden’s” election in the USA. Unlike “Biden” versus Trump, Lula managed to jail his rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, whose party has been shattered. Prediction: Trump and Marco Rubio will work hard to neutralize the Foro de São Paulo’s operations across South America. Prediction: they will attempt to spring Bolsonaro from prison in time for the October 2026 election. Prediction: Lula will encounter strong, Trump-induced headwinds in the election. Mr. Trump is leaning hard on President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico to cease support of the drug cartels sending fentanyl into the USA. (Ha! How is that even plausible?) He’s gone as far as threatening to send American troops after the cartels’ headquarters in Mexico, and he imposed a 25-percent tariff on Mexican goods exported to the USA, but the duties were “paused” pending progress on border security and drug cooperation. At least, crossings of illegal migrants through Mexico has been reduced to near-zero on the cusp of 2026. Trump and Rubio would like to think they can work with Sheinbaum. Altogether, President Trump is reawakening interest in the America’s relations with South America after a long coma-like period of official inattention. He can already claim a substantial victory in reinstating American control over the Panama Canal with almost zero fanfare and no negative blowback. China still controls ports associated with the canal. They will probably be encouraged to sell those assets. In 2014, China broke ground symbolically for a new trans-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, estimated cost $50-billion. Since then, nothing has happened with it. The project remains suspended and no construction begun. China might be discerning that further colonialist activity in this hemisphere is a low-percentage, unwelcome move. Rampant Dragons and Rising Suns The far east is now a region of fully modernized sovereign states with high-tech armies, heavy industry, and rising prospects compared to Europe (now headed in the opposite direction), with China the biggest dog in the yard. China’s swift thirty-year lift out of something like 12th Century darkness has been an amazing spectacle, for sure. The USA is deeply intimidated by China’s manufacturing dominance, its technological prowess, and its growing military capability. There’s been plenty of loose talk about China’s “long game” aspiration to acquireNorth America as a resource depot. Sending tens of thousands of military-age men through “Joe Biden’s” open border 2021 to 2025 reinforced that worry. We still don’t know what they are up to here, what they are programmed to carry-out, and what we’re going to do about it. The news media isn’t paying attention to that for now. Many expect China to attempt some form of creeping world domination in the decades ahead. As Martin Armstrong put it (paraphrase): Cycles are a kind of religion in China, and they believe now is their turn in history. Yes, they probably think so. But I tend to view their rapid rise to world power as a self-limiting condition. We Americans know something about how quickly great techno-industrial surges can turn and go to shit. Just look around the midwestern rust-belt. The citizens of Detroit back in 1955 would be astonished at the current condition of what had been the seventh-richest city in the world then. A similar fate might await China, since it still depends so heavily on oil and natgas imports and coal-fired power plants. China also lacks the sturdy body of property law that tends to prevent hot battles over domains and the things of value built on them. For now, that authority is vested in the caprices of the CCP. But you must wonder how much possibly independent authority is lodged in the Peoples’ Liberation Army and its generals. Though the CCP has managed to remain in operation for a long time, it is not necessarily a permanent installation in the human condition. China’s population — which, by the way, is rumored to be well under the 1.4-billion claimed (estimated as low as 775-million now) — has been getting restive as the country’s industry matures and begins to show signs of similar sclerosis as seen in America. The financial condition of the country remains especially sketchy, since the CCP controls the banks and can stage-manage their outward appearances. Inside, Chinese banks are a vast chaos of janky loans based on a collateral of hopelessly crappy, fast-disintegrating high-rise apartments that China’s new middle class was swindled into buying for investment purposes, not to live in. Youth unemployment is trending at around 15-percent now. Prediction: expect more social unrest in China, with a destabilizing effect on the CCP’s ability to control events. The world’s attention tends to be focused on the fate of Taiwan, the island nation that was under direct Chinese mainland rule from 1683 to 1895, after which it was briefly swapped to Japan, who lost it in World War Two. In 1949, Chinese nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to the island from Mao Zedong’s communists. It has evolved into a stable democratic republic and a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse. The USA is addicted to Taiwan’s computer chips, but then we are addicted to scores of products and resources from mainland still-communist China, too. It appears that the Trump admin is trying to wriggle out of that dilemma by re-industrializing the USA. Prediction: China, has been playing the long game as usual, and will keep hands-off Taiwan in 2026, while continuing to signal its control over whatever comes in and goes out of the island. China does not want to commit to a financially ruinous war over Taiwan at this moment of financial instability on the mainland. Prediction: The long game doesn’t pan out. This will be Xi Jinping’s last year as leader of China. Economic turmoil will prompt the CCP to replace him, and serial replacements won’t last. China slips and drifts as no one can consolidate power. India slips and drifts too, unable to overcome its predicament of reliance on imported oil and foreign investment. Prediction: Narendra Modi loses his grip on power. India’s economy falters and the subcontinent begins to fracture into regions. All major nations of Southeast Asia struggle to stay afloat on the cheap labor manufacturing boom largely pegged to a wobbling global economy with the US as consumer of the first-and-last resort. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia will all come under a strain in 2026 as their factories idle. Radical groups begin to rise and challenge established power bases. Things go sideways. Global Jihad They’re not subtle about it. Islamic Jihad advertises itself loudly at the local grass-roots level. Imams in the UK, France, Germany, Dearborn (MI), all proclaim that the places they have migrated to will become Muslim-dominated. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani says he believes in global jihad. For mysterious reasons, this seems to tickle the uber-woke liberals of the Upper West Side who voted for Mamdani. The Jihadis shout about the death of America, the death of Western Civ, the death of all who are not Islamists. It’s woven into the Muslim theology. Muslims who kill “infidels” get super brownie-points in the permission structure of Islam. The west has rolled over for this malevolent nonsense for some years now, and it is all coming to a head in 2026. Prediction: EU nations and the UK will begin deporting recent illegal migrants back to where they came from, starting slowly and accelerating as resistance and violence by the designated deportees (and their allies) make it ever clearer that it is an existential necessity to get them out — and beef up their coastline protections so that new migrants cannot enter. Mostly freelance non-state Jihadis will attempt bloody operations against the property and interests of the deporting nations. They will bomb and massacre inside EU countries (likely here in America, too), and outside America against embassies and corporate property. Prediction: The mass deportations will mark a major turnaround in the West, and will be accompanied by changes in government, including the dissolution of the EU bureaucracy itself. Brussells, Belgium, the EU headquarters city, with a large Muslim population, will be a violent hot-spot. Islamism will begin to be turned back. Street protests only just erupted in Iran after Christmas, and are reaching impressive levels quickly. It’s too early to say where it is going. New Year’s Day, businesses, schools, and government offices were shut down — but, the holiday and all. Growing severe water shortages might be behind the unrest as much as dissatisfaction with decades of mullah rule. Trump and the US Domestic Scene At holiday time late in 2025, after nearly a year of exhilarating and tumultuous Trump 2.0 activity, a dark cloud swept over MAGA and many Trump supporters started gobbling up black pills and getting super-depressed. The assassination of Charlie Kirk tripped a lot of that off. It was a significant event. In a nation where reality is now optional for many groups and individuals, every niche of uncertainty and doubt gets filled with narrative battles that harden fear and paranoia. Oddly, with so much of the Woke Left pimping for Hamas the past two years against Israel, elements of the MAGA Right picked up that gonfalon and ran with it, too — led by podcasters Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, and Tucker Carlson. Candace put out the idea that Israel killed Charlie, and many others just twanged against Israel on the general principle that Israel showers too much money on congressmen and senators — and that the executive branch is too cozy with the Jewish state — and, of course, Gaza (“Genocide.”) So now, you have both the Wokesters and part of MAGA hatin’ on Israel. A lot of this heat was probably generated by the RINO / NeverTrumper branch of the Republican Party seeking to wrassle back its hegemony over the party’s electoral apparatus from Trump / MAGA forces. Ron DeSantis is the RINO / NeverTrumper stalking horse, with that gang setting-up a potential switcheroo for JD Vance’s expected run in 2028. The bottom line, as advanced by the inimitable “Sundance” writing at The Last Refuge blogspot is that the RINO / NeverTrumper gang actually wants to lose the 2026 midterms so that Mr. Trump will be hamstrung for the remainder of his term. Prediction: MAGA has strategic and tactical capabilities that shouldn’t be underestimated. They will fight hard against their in-party enemies moving through the coming year and the fight will reveal the bad intentions of their enemies. Meanwhile, on the other front, the Trump admin is working hard to sever the NGO revenue lines that support the Democratic Party’s shock troops, Antifa, what remains of BLM, the lawfare ninjas, the From-the-River-to-the-Sea crowd, and assorted cadres of the mentally ill. The DOJ, along with its subsidiary, the FBI, is preparing to go medieval on these groups. AAG Harmeet Dhillon is turning the mojo of her Civil Rights division against anarchists who operated freely under “Joe Biden” — and they will liberally use the “domestic terrorist” tag to make this happen. AAG Dhillon is also keeping pressure on the colleges and universities that permitted Jihad on-campus and will take the federal funding away from the grownups who run these joints — who stand by and do nothing in the face of violence and intimidation. Prediction: Anti-Israel activism has gone as far as it can go and will start tailing off now as Israel’s operations in Gaza rachet down. Hamas is defeated. That’s a plain fact. It’s over over there. The surviving Palestinians will be living under a protectorate that requires them to give up devoting themselves to terror. As averred to previously, Jihad will not be greeted favorably in the USA, whether in Mamdani’s New York City or Ilhan Omar’s Minneapolis. MAGA will screw its head back on and re-focus on our country’s priorities: rebuilding productive infrastructure, carefully dismantling rogue financialization like the colossal IED it is, rescuing the American family from Woke depradations, making the people healthy again, reestablishing a coherent consensus on culture, values, right-and-wrong, and getting violence out of public life. The biggest head-wind that Trump faces, of course, is a sociopathic Democratic Party that will do anything to return to power and resume its racketeering operations. Prediction: In 2026, many of their point-persons, past-and-present, will be headed into a courtroom, possibly to a guilty verdict for conspiracy to overthrow the government and other serious charges, such as election fraud. “Joe Biden’s” blanket pardons will be declared illegitimate by SCOTUS due to the profligate use of the autopen by “JB’s” reckless subordinates (some of whom will also land in court). Higher-ups in the health agencies who took part in the Covid-19 operation will also find themselves in legal jeopardy, including the Covid Pimpernel himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, if he remains alive. Some military figures such as general Milley will face charges. Nothing less than a comprehensive cleanup will do. If Mr. Trump lets the seditions continue, he’ll be buffaloed for the next three years just like the first time around. It’s possible that he will have to invoke a national emergency in order to overcome the resistance of the lawfare federal judge coterie. And I would not feel too sanguine about the members of Nancy Pelosi’s J-6 House Committee, or Ms. Pelosi herself in connection with the FBI / Democratic Party J-6 fake insurrection prank at the Capitol itself. Justice is coming before the 2026 midterms. Finance and Economy Mr. Trump’s biggest headwind is the ever-jankier finance sector of the US economy, a horrific, mold-like overgrowth that has sickened the country with hyper-complex trickery around debt and capital. Too many faithless promises have been made to pay back debts that will never be paid back. And too much wealth has migrated into a few elite hands on the back of those false promises. Too much collateral is mispriced and over-priced, and the re-pricing is liable to be rather violent. At the top are x-quadrillions of derivative positions — bets that could wreck global banking if they go wrong. Then the overpriced equity markets and the bond markets. If enough of that stuff goes south there will be broken pension funds, very few surviving banks, and what’s left of the Boomer generation gets financially wiped out. This late in the game, it’s hard to see how that can be averted. If it plays out, you will see widespread hardship that makes the Great Depression of the 1930s look like one bad day at the races. Trump & Company know that this debacle is ‘out there’ like a Cat-5 hurricane spinning in the Gulf Stream. They are trying to run a practical work-around program of re-industrializing the country so we can become a production-based society for the broad middle rather than a game-playing economy for the hedge-fund bunch. They are using strong-arm tactics with other nations to get reindustrialization paid-for with foreign investment and tariffs. It’s a tough play because reinvestment and rebuilding can’t happen overnight. It’s a long-game, too. And in the short-term the financial games are getting ready to blow. Much depends on how SCOTUS rules on the president’s Article II power to use tariffs as an instrument of foreign policy. The president claims he has work-arounds in the event that the decision goes against him. If SCOTUS does rule against Trump on tariff power and dismantles what he has put in place in 2025, the markets, banks, and currencies will wobble and crash. Their decision is a game of Russian roulette, and you can be sure they know it. You’ll see headlines such as: SCOTUS Destroys Global Economy. Prediction: SCOTUS won’t dare disable Mr. Trump’s tariff weapon. Decision in early spring. The longer they drag it out, the more potential damage. Let’s say there is some sort of crash in 2026, anyway. The equity markets teeter at super-record highs. There is a complete departure in trendlines between the financial part of the economy and the on-the-ground economy of businesses and services that have become increasingly unaffordable. Cars, apartments, groceries, medical stuff, you know: the basics. So far, reindustrialization remains a plan, a dream. Very few of those factory jobs have materialized and the in the immortal words of the late Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. Sidebar: The Specter of AI A lot of the money in equity markets is pouring into Artificial Intelligence (AI), mainly the insanely overpriced Nvidia. AI is supposed to be the engine of the next tech revolution. I demur. I suspect it will disappoint. It will not make our lives better, it will, at best, just make a lot of common operations in daily life more frustrating by removing humans from the equation; and, at worst, it will destroy the human race. I tend to see it flopping on the ‘at best’ side. Your life has already been made worse by computer interventions in daily life, case-in-point: your attempts to contact a business. Computers cut you off at the pass. . . poorly designed phone “tree” answering programs waste hours of your time before they completely fuck up whatever transaction you attempt: a dinner reservation, a product return, a complaint to the Internet service, an attempt to get your medical lab report. Applied AI will only spread that nonsense into every other available niche in your existence. Nothing will work. No one will answer. And that can only go on so long before you get a revolution, a social collapse, a systems apocalypse, a one-way ticket back to the medieval. Coupla other obvious failure-points in the AI dream: 1) As AI increasingly “trains” on material created by AI, it becomes a self-referential hallucination of false data. You won’t be able to rely on anything it “thinks,” or any task it is assigned to carry out. And that doesn’t include its potential for going rogue and developing evil intentions of its own. And 2) The obvious strain on electric power generation, the grid. Investments in new electric generating capacity may be greater than any economic return from AI, whether the added power is nuclear or something more amazingly new and exotic that hasn’t been invented yet. Plus, AI server requirements are already making electric service unaffordable for everyday people. Economically, the thing begins to look like a mirage, including the titanic investments being made in it. Finally, imagine the psychological effect of generalized AI failure. It will put the basic notion of technological progress into a fatal funk as the human race has to go back to the drawing-board and find some other way to keep economic growth going in a finite world. Anyway, a financial train wreck can take different forms, depending on how the authorities respond to the first tremors. Could be a failure of our currency, the dollar, and steeper inflation, where you have a lot of money that has little value and can’t buy much. Could be a massive deflation in which debt failure is acknowledged and money dissipates, leaving behind a scant supply of money that still has value, but not enough to go around. . . meaning many people are just broke. Stock and bond market blowups will just be manifestations of these basic financial illnesses, failures of faith really. Prediction: We do get a crash in equities and bonds. Mr. Trump has to take on the FDR role in a hurry. It might require yet another kind of national emergency to allow a restructuring of US finance that protects the broad middle class from penury. It will take some luck for Mr. Trump to find a way to accomplish this restructuring, but Donald Trump has experienced this kind of brush with ruin personally and he knows how a calamity like this can be turned around. We’ll have to stand by to see how he plays it, how it plays him, and how history plays him and us. It will have to include novel moves besides just the same old federal reserve money-printing a shuck-and-jive. Prediction: expect real novelties, like abolishing the Federal Reserve altogether and reassigning money-issuance to the US Treasury, using a partially gold-backed dollar. Mr. Trump is already making noises about abolishing the federal income tax altogether. And there’s no question that he would love a chance to severely cut down the size and scope of the federal government so, at least, everyday people can carry on in businesses without many of the onerous regulatory burdens that make everything so difficult now. A financial emergency would require a comprehensive reform of health-care including the dismantling of hospital cartels, insurance behemoths, and all the nonsensical bureaucracy that has turned every doctors’ office into something that looks like the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Oil Scene and Energy Superficially, the numbers paint a sanguine picture, but like the black gold itself, the story lurks below the surface. The US Energy Information Agency shows total US oil production for 2025 at an all-time record high of 13.61-million barrels-a-day (b/d). The agency predicts just a bit under that for 2026: 13.53-million b/d. The US-EIA is traditionally optimistic. Americans want cheap oil and they want lots of it. The shale oil “miracle” has delivered a lotta oil as President Trump might say. We’ve been stupendously fortunate the past decade-and-a-half. Some big howevers, however. Shale oil is very expensive to get out of the ground with horizontal drilling, fracking, trucked-in frack water, chemicals, and special fracking sand. It requires very fancy financing, and the state of finance (that is, lending) generally looks shaky going forward. The oil industry has always been a precarious business. The current price of $57-a-barrel (West Texas Crude) is not high enough to provide a return-on-investment for most operators. Break-even lies between $70-90 a barrel. Lenders are reluctant to lend where there is a poor prospect for return-on-investment. But, of course, Americans demand cheap gasoline and low oil prices destroy the companies that are supposed to deliver the cheap gasoline. It’s a predicament with no easy answer. The current numbers suggest the US has finally entered a production plateau preceding major decline by 2028. The drilling rig count in the Permian Basin in late 2025 was 20 to 25 percent lower than in 2024, from 308 active rigs in 2024 to 246 rigs as of Dec 19, 2025. The Permian Basin accounts for nearly half of all US drilling rigs. The US-EIA also expects the average oil price for 2026 to hover at $55 average, lower than the all-year average $69 for 2025. Prediction: under those circumstances, a lower rig-count will bring some oil company bankruptcies, plus accelerating depletion because Permian Basin shale oil wells decline by 70 percent after the first year and lower rig counts mean fewer new wells to replace that lost production. Drill baby, drill is a nice rallying cry, but it would be years before any production could come out of Alaska’s ANWR fields, if ever. If US oil companies return to Venezuela, global supply will go up and the price of oil could decline further. As for the vaunted green energy revolution, independent analyst Art Berman, refers to this as “Renewable Derangement Syndrome: the belief that an ‘energy transition’ is well underway, despite clear evidence to the contrary. It’s the conviction that solar panels and wind turbines are replacing fossil fuels at scale when, in fact, renewables remain a rounding error in global energy supply.” Gold and Silver These things used to be money for thousands of years. For the past hundred years, the financial authorities called it a “barbarous relic.” Now, gold and silver are back, sort of, but first in the role of messenger. Surely, you’ve noticed that gold zoomed from just over $2600/oz to $4500/oz through 2025, while silver moved from $29/oz to $80/oz just after Christmas 2025. Epic moves (followed by a sharp correction New Year’s week). Supposedly, the silver market is super-agitated by the industrial need for silver in electric cars, robot electronics, and the hardware for AI. That’s part of the story. While there are plenty of technical factors, cycle explanations, and parties still manipulating the market price of precious metals, the main message of the metals must be an apprehension of social and political upheaval ahead. Metals move when people are afraid that the basic social contract is falling apart. . . that war might be coming. Everything in this forecast has spoken of unrest, upheaval, inflection points, and the circulation of elites. Gold and silver are what people turn to when they lose confidence in the institutions that stand behind money, namely governments and central banks. They also lose trust in things that purport to represent money. Those things all have counterparties lodged in the agreements around debt. Our debt-based money system is delaminating, with the various layers peeling off into worthlessness: mortgages, loans, bond obligations, etc. The counterparties are the persons or entities who offered the loan and the persons or entity who can’t pay back the loan. When that breaks, when loans don’t get paid back, money vanishes. Gold and silver don’t have counterparties, they just. . . are. They embody the work and energy that went into finding them, digging them out, smelting them, and assaying them, and that’s all. Central banks around the world have been buying up gold and silver with increasing avidity because nations are moving to currencies that are at least partially backed by precious metals. Such a move will severely cut down the issuance of loans, especially loans used to leverage investment positions in other financial instruments — that is, to blow market bubbles. Prediction: sometime in late 2026, gold will arrive at $7,500 and silver will rise to $150 or $200. Paper currencies pegged to nothing but vaporous claims of the full faith and credit of the government, or the backing of an imperial navy, have been the norm for several generations. Sometimes, the bottom falls out of your norm bucket, and you have to make new mental arrangements. In a gold-backed money ecosystem, the opportunities for many kinds of financial legerdemain expire. Swindles are still possible, but as far less complex con-jobs. Further prediction: if this effort fails and paper currencies can no longer be trusted at all, everyday transactions might devolve to circulating silver coin, for a while, anyway, in which case the standard of living will be a whole lot lower for everybody. Bitcoin It is nothing more than the fugazy of all fugazies. It has no essential, discernable, real value. It’s astonishing that it got this far, but it is more complex than a tulip bulb and hyper-complexity appeals to people in finance. It creates evermore opportunities for swindles and frauds. Even if blockchain technology itself has some value, Bitcoin is still a worthless fugazy, sustained only by the general climate of psychosis in finance. As the psychosis lifts, Bitcoin’s value will sink. Prediction: by the third quarter of 2026, Bitcoin is back below $25,000 and headed for extinction. Concluding Notes As usual, apologies for going on so long. 2026 will require more than the usual fortitude, especially for those stuck in conventional investments and who are gurgling under water on mortgages and other loans. On the political front: expect broad and serious prosecutions of many known villains who, one way and another, tried to overthrow the republic since 2016. Unlike just about everybody else in the forecasting business, I don’t believe the Democratic Party will be able to take back the House of Representatives or the US Senate in the 2026 midterms. They have left too wide a slime trail of corruption, avarice, lunacy, and treason. Lastly, a salute to the intrepid President Donald J. Trump, for all his faults, a true American hero.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval. Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2025. T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund will be merged with and into the T. Rowe Price New Asia Fund on or about April 17, 2026. Around the same time, the T. Rowe Price International Disciplined Equity Fund will be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the T. Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund. VictoryShares International Volatility Weighted ETF will liquidate on or about February 4, 2026. Volatility Shares 2x Wheat ETF and 2x Corn ETF disappear on January 30, 2026. Voya Global Perspectives Portfolio will be liquidated on or about May 15, 2026. The Shadow here!

I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: China pushes robot access mainstream with Qingtianzhu’s 1 RMB ‘flash rental’ service

UPDATED 19:29 EST / DECEMBER 31 2025 by Duncan Riley Though 2025 may be remembered for the artificial intelligence boom, not far behind has been the emergence of advanced humanoid robotics. And while the U.S. and the West more broadly have somewhat lagged in robotics, China enters the new year arguably well ahead in the robotics game. According to a report Tuesday from Chia-focused tech site Pandaily on New Year’s Eve, Chinese company Qingtianzhu (Shanghai) Technology Co. Ltd. has launched a “1 RMB robot rental” service across 10 major cities, marking one of the most aggressive attempts yet to normalize on-demand access to humanoid robots. 1 RMB is 14 cents in U.S. dollars. The initiative allows users to reserve humanoid robots for short-term use via QR code, with centralized scheduling designed to support deployment across multiple scenarios. The service is currently available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing. It’s positioned as a way to lower barriers to experimenting with humanoid robots in commercial and public settings. Sina Finance reported Tuesday that the 1 RMB price is a promotional entry point that is intended to attract first-time users and accelerate adoption rather than reflect the full commercial cost of robot deployment. Qingtianzhu describes the offering as a “flash rental” model with rapid booking, standardized service workflows and dedicated on-site personnel to ensure stable operation during events. The move is described by Chinese media as part of a broader effort to build a national robot leasing ecosystem. Qingtianzhu’s platform is acting as a kind of “robot Didi,” designed to match demand from businesses, exhibitions, conferences and brand activations with available robot inventory across cities. Didi is mainland China’s most popular ride-hailing service provider and is often described as the Uber of China. The long-term goal is reportedly to scale robot leasing in a way that mirrors ride-hailing and equipment-sharing platforms rather than traditional industrial procurement. The real significance of the initiative lies in distribution and utilization, not margins. The idea is that by encouraging frequent, short-term rentals, Qingtianzhu can gather operational data, refine deployment workflows and expose more customers to humanoid robots in real-world environments. The 1 RMB price could also be described as a loss leader to introduce people to the benefits of renting robots and over time, drive demand for higher-value rentals, long-term leases, or customized robotic services. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the idea of robot rental services is still a pipe dream, though some companies are getting closer with their robotic endeavors. Tesla Inc. debuted its Optimus robots in October 2024 to much fanfare, but not much has been heard of the offering since. With China surging ahead in robotics, companies in the West have a lot of catching up to do, but as AI continues to improve and hence the ability to control robots, 2026 should see more movement in the market. The dream that one day there will be a robot in every house isn’t that far off, albeit one far closer to reality in the Middle Kingdom than in middle America.

Full Content:
Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval.

Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund. VictoryShares International Volatility Weighted ETF will liquidate on or about February 4, 2026. Volatility Shares 2x Wheat ETF and 2x Corn ETF disappear on January 30, 2026. Voya Global Perspectives Portfolio will be liquidated on or about May 15, 2026. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.
