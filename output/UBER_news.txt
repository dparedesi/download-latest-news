View all partners Before January 27 2025, it’s fair to say that Chinese tech company DeepSeek was flying under the radar. And then it came dramatically into view. Suddenly, everyone was talking about it – not least the shareholders and executives at US tech firms like Nvidia, Microsoft and Google, which all saw their company values tumble thanks to the success of this AI startup research lab. Founded by a successful Chinese hedge fund manager, the lab has taken a different approach to artificial intelligence. One of the major differences is cost. The development costs for Open AI’s ChatGPT-4 were said to be in excess of US$100 million (£81 million). DeepSeek’s R1 model – which is used to generate content, solve logic problems and create computer code – was reportedly made using much fewer, less powerful computer chips than the likes of GPT-4, resulting in costs claimed (but unverified) to be as low as US$6 million. This has both financial and geopolitical effects. China is subject to US sanctions on importing the most advanced computer chips. But the fact that a Chinese startup has been able to build such an advanced model raises questions about the effectiveness of these sanctions, and whether Chinese innovators can work around them. The timing of DeepSeek’s new release on January 20, as Donald Trump was being sworn in as president, signalled a challenge to US dominance in AI. Trump responded by describing the moment as a “wake-up call”. From a financial point of view, the most noticeable effect may be on consumers. Unlike rivals such as OpenAI, which recently began charging US$200 per month for access to their premium models, DeepSeek’s comparable tools are currently free. They are also “open source”, allowing anyone to poke around in the code and reconfigure things as they wish. Low costs of development and efficient use of hardware seem to have afforded DeepSeek this cost advantage, and have already forced some Chinese rivals to lower their prices. Consumers should anticipate lower costs from other AI services too. Longer term – which, in the AI industry, can still be remarkably soon – the success of DeepSeek could have a big impact on AI investment. This is because so far, almost all of the big AI companies – OpenAI, Meta, Google – have been struggling to commercialise their models and be profitable. Until now, this was not necessarily a problem. Companies like Twitter and Uber went years without making profits, prioritising a commanding market share (lots of users) instead. And companies like OpenAI have been doing the same. In exchange for continuous investment from hedge funds and other organisations, they promise to build even more powerful models. These models, the business pitch probably goes, will massively boost productivity and then profitability for businesses, which will end up happy to pay for AI products. In the mean time, all the tech companies need to do is collect more data, buy more powerful chips (and more of them), and develop their models for longer. But this costs a lot of money. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip – the world’s most powerful AI chip to date – costs around US$40,000 per unit, and AI companies often need tens of thousands of them. But up to now, AI companies haven’t really struggled to attract the necessary investment, even if the sums are huge. DeepSeek might change all this. By demonstrating that innovations with existing (and perhaps less advanced) hardware can achieve similar performance, it has given a warning that throwing money at AI is not guaranteed to pay off. For example, prior to January 20, it may have been assumed that the most advanced AI models require massive data centres and other infrastructure. This meant the likes of Google, Microsoft and OpenAI would face limited competition because of the high barriers (the vast expense) to enter this industry. But if those barriers to entry are much lower than everyone thinks – as DeepSeek’s success suggests – then many massive AI investments suddenly look a lot riskier. Hence the abrupt effect on big tech share prices. Shares in chipmaker Nvidia fell by around 17% and ASML, which creates the machines needed to manufacture advanced chips, also saw its share price fall. (While there has been a slight bounceback in Nvidia’s stock price, it appears to have settled below its previous highs, reflecting a new market reality.) Nvidia and ASML are “pick-and-shovel” companies that make the tools necessary to create a product, rather than the product itself. (The term comes from the idea that in a goldrush, the only person guaranteed to make money is the one selling the picks and shovels.) The “shovels” they sell are chips and chip-making equipment. The fall in their share prices came from the sense that if DeepSeek’s much cheaper approach works, the billions of dollars of future sales that investors have priced into these companies may not materialise. For the likes of Microsoft, Google and Meta (OpenAI is not publicly traded), the cost of building advanced AI may now have fallen, meaning these firms will have to spend less to remain competitive. That, for them, could be a good thing. But there is now doubt as to whether these companies can successfully monetise their AI programmes. US stocks make up a historically large percentage of global investment right now, and technology companies make up a historically large percentage of the value of the US stock market. Losses in this industry might force investors to sell off other investments to cover their losses in tech, leading to a whole-market downturn. And it shouldn’t have come as a surprise. In 2023, a leaked Google memo warned that the AI industry was exposed to outsider disruption. The memo argued that AI companies “had no moat” – no protection – against rival models. DeepSeek’s success may be the proof that this is true. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 197,300 academics and researchers from 5,123 institutions.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Are Being Monitored By Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other top AI stocks that are being monitored by Wall Street. As the global tech sector was catching up to the disruption caused by DeepSeek’s r1 AI model, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced its brand new Qwen 2.5 AI model on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The Qwen 2.5 is pre-trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal data and rivals DeepSeek’s AI model. “Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,” the group’s cloud unit on its official WeChat account. The latest Chinese AI model release also sent US firms scrambling to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently teased several “exciting new features” coming to ChatGPT and a new ChatGPT Gov tool to bolster ties with the US government. The rise of advanced, cost-effective Chinese AI models has introduced volatility in US stocks as analysts rampantly rerate companies and shift outlooks based on the rapidly evolving tech landscape. We selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a mobility Software-as-a-Service company that connects riders with drivers, offers food delivery and grocery shopping services, and integrates public transport in over 70 countries. The company has continually invested in AI over the past decade, and the tech is now a critical part of company operations. It uses AI and ML to improve ETA predictions, pricing, risk assessments, customer service, the company’s internal productivity, and overall business operations. On January 28th, BofA analyst Justin Post marginally trimmed Uber Technologies Inc.’s (NYSE:UBER) stock price target to $93 from $96 but retained a “Buy” rating. The brokerage believes the company’s current valuation “seems to reflect a big AV overhang.” However, analysts see opportunities for multiple expansions based on steady growth and margin improvement this year, combined with a “stable-to-improving” autonomous vehicle narrative. Overall, UBER ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks that are being monitored by Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Forbes Daily: DeepSeek’s ‘Wake-Up Call’ And Nvidia’s Historic Plunge

Good morning, The debut of a new AI model from China’s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday. DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month, surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It’s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective. The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tanking the fortunes of several notable billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang’s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Markets plunged Monday after the debut of DeepSeek, hitting tech stocks especially hard as the Nasdaq had its fourth-worst day of the last two years. Semiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia plunged 17%, losing $589 billion in market capitalization—by far the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any company in history. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek, calling it “a positive development” and a “wake-up call” for U.S. industries. MORE: A Forbes review found the AI model avoids answering questions about topics commonly censored by the Chinese government. Forbes asked DeepSeek five questions on controversial topics, like “What is Taiwan’s status with China?” and “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” Investor interest in the first big IPO of Trump 2.0—liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global—has been lukewarm. The stock has already fallen nearly 20%, but it still solidifies Venture Global’s place in the public markets with an impressive $50 billion market cap. And the holdings of its cofounders now amount to $20 billion each. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Controversial billionaire Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s bet on Amer Sports, the parent company of such brands as Arc’teryx and Salomon, appears to be paying off. Wilson, who left his role as Lululemon’s board chair in 2013 following his controversial comments about women’s bodies, sold shares of the company to buy a nearly 21% stake in Amer Sports. That investment is now worth about $3.2 billion, double its value when the company went public in February 2024. Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google Maps will display the name “Gulf of America” instead of the “Gulf of Mexico” for U.S. users once government sources are updated to reflect the name change ordered by President Donald Trump last week, the tech giant announced Monday. The company said it has a “longstanding practice” of applying name changes when they have been “updated in official government sources.” President Donald Trump signed three executive orders Monday targeting military personnel in an expansion of his crackdown on DEI initiatives. The orders not only rescinded the military’s DEI practices, they also banned transgender individuals from serving, and reinstated service members who were fired for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine. There were around 14,000 transgender service members in the U.S. military as of 2018, according to CNN. Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images Tickets to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl are listed for as much as $56,000 on the secondary market, indicating that this year’s championship game could be the priciest in NFL history. The cheapest seats on Gametime were available for $6,492 per ticket, though Super Bowl tickets typically decline in price in the two weeks leading up to game day. In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health reiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has “issued a pause” on communications and public appearances by agency staff. But the document also states that clinical trials at the NIH and its funded institutions are ongoing. Still, NIH staffers remain frustrated, with one source saying that “there have never been politics in the NIH. When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that’s where the fear in large part is coming from.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly received guidance to immediately stop working with the World Health Organization, following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations agency. While Trump can withdraw the United States from WHO, the U.S. must give a “one-year notice” and meet its financial obligations to the agency for that fiscal year, according to a joint resolution from 1948. The IRS has made moves to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The agency is revoking some job offers and removing job postings. And last week, Trump suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border. The Boeing logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. TOPLINE When it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer—of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That’s a stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history. The lousy news is partly due to the disruption of a seven-week strike by Boeing’s machinists that halted production of the company’s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It’s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing’s defense division. And then there are the company’s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787. Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time: a staggering $35.7 billion. Despite Boeing’s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company’s finances thanks to the company’s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again. The company raised $24 billion late last year through a sale of stock and convertible debt. WHY IT MATTERS Fourth-quarter earnings season isn’t done yet, but Boeing’s discouraging 2024 results are almost certain to bolster the company’s lead as the biggest loser in the S&P 500 index since 2019, according to data from FactSet. Uber, which was running a close second to Boeing through 2023, is expected to report a profit for 2024. MORE Why Boeing Needs A New Plane — Soon Hosting a Super Bowl party at home will cost roughly the same as last year for a group of 10, according to Wells Fargo’s Super Bowl Food report. The price of some items, like avocados and chicken wings, significantly increased, but they were balanced out by major decreases for chips and certain vegetables: $139: The average cost of a game day gathering featuring fan favorites, just 0.1% more than last year 11.9%: The year-over-year increase in the price of cherry tomatoes, which saw the biggest jump 0.7% to 5.1%: The decline in prices for nacho cheese dip, salsa, tortilla chips and potato chips from 2024 Many organizations struggle with company culture, even as it remains critically important: Employees who feel connected to their organization are four times more likely to be engaged at work, research shows. Start by honestly assessing your company’s current culture, prioritize employee wellbeing to prevent burnout and communicate a compelling vision for a potential culture shift.
