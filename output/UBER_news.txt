US stock market steadied Tuesday as Trump's tariff deadline delay gave investors hope for new global trade deals. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures showed modest movement after Trump extended the July 9 tariff start date to August 1, offering trading partners more time to negotiate. Countries like South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia now have breathing space to respond. While markets remain cautious, the delay sparked optimism that Trump’s firm-yet-flexible stance may open the door for diplomatic progress. Investors now await the Fed minutes and Delta’s earnings to see what’s next for the economy.

Title: Tesla’s troubles are deeper than you think | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Tesla’s troubles go far beyond CEO Elon Musk’s recent dust-up with President Donald Trump, who accused the former “first buddy” of going “completely ‘off the rails’” in a social media slap fight over the weekend. But while the battles between Musk and Trump are getting all the attention, the outlook for Tesla’s revenue and bottom line have gotten notably worse. And the company could even be back to losing money, for reasons unrelated to Musk’s personal politics. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the 2024 campaign, and was a mainstay at Mar-a-Lago and the White House at the start of Trump’s second term, with his role in slashing the federal workforce at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But Musk has since announced he was starting a new political party due to his displeasure with the tax and spending bill signed by Trump on Friday — and the barbs on their respective websites have only increased since then. Shares of Tesla closed Monday down 6.8%, as investors were concerned about the implication of Musk’s latest political moves, despite his promises to re-focus on the company. It rebounded only 1.3% in Tuesday trading. “Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who’s known for being optimistic about the company. Ives put out a follow-up note Tuesday saying that the Tesla board should set ground rules to limit Musk’s political activities because the company is at a “tipping point” for its future. “Tesla is heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep and cannot have Musk spending more and more time creating a political party which will require countless time, energy, and political capital,” he wrote. Still, Ives maintained his buy recommendation and $500 price target for the stock in his note. But analysts at William Blair cut their recommendation on the stock to “market perform” or neutral, and also cut their earnings forecast for the company. Because even without the political stink, the Tesla’s financial outlook is suddenly looking notably worse. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. But when Ives posted his belief that the Tesla board should tie Musk’s future pay package to the amount of time he spends at Tesla and have oversight of his political “endeavors,” Musk responded with his own post on X, saying “Shut up, Dan.” Blair’s note pointed out that Trump’s bill not only removed the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) buyers, but also eliminated the financial penalties for automakers that fail to meet federal emissions targets. Emissions fines have historically forced automakers who still build primarily gasoline powered cars and trucks to buy “regulatory credits” from EV companies. Removing those fines eliminates “market demand for Tesla’s credits,” said the note from William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter. The sale of those federal and state credits added $10.6 billion to Tesla’s bottom line since 2019 and often enabled the company to post a profit. Without the revenue from those regulatory credits, the company would not have reported a positive annual net income until 2021, and it would have been back in the red again in the first quarter of this year, when its net income plunged 71% compared to a year earlier on sharply lower sales around the globe. Musk has largely downplayed all the recent bad news, saying the company’s future rests on robots, artificial intelligence and self-driving taxis. But the company’s taxi service is very limited to date, launching only in Austin, Texas, for a select group of customers – mostly Tesla fans – and with a Tesla employee riding in the front passenger seat to monitor the car’s performance. That puts Tesla behind the robotaxi service already offered in Austin and three other cities – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix – by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet. And Tesla’s rollout has had its shares of problems, including a video showing a robotaxi traveling on the wrong side of the road for about half of a block and another video of a robotaxi slowly turning its front wheels into a parked car. While Musk has promised his robotaxi service will be expanding soon across many other cities, he has not given any further details. He also hasn’t said when the Austin service will be expanded to the general public, nor when the company’s human monitors sitting in the front passenger seat will no longer be needed. Meanwhile, Waymo has definitive plans to expand its service to Miami and Washington, DC, next year in partnership with Uber. “We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk’s attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,” said the William Blair note. “We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.” Then there’s the problem of Tesla’s sales. Or rather, the lack thereof. Global sales were down a record 13% in each of the first two quarters of this year, compared to a year earlier, even though demand for EVs overall continues to climb, a further sign of Tesla’s declining market share. Part of the lost EV market share is due to increased competition, both from Western automakers rolling out their own EV offerings, and Chinese automakers that have made a massive push into the market. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to surpass Tesla in global annual EV sales this year for the first time, even though Tesla is a still a major player in China, and BYDs are not sold in the US. Demand is likely to weaken further come October 1, when the $7,500 tax credit for electric car buyers expires. When a previous version of the tax credit was phased out for Teslas in 2019, the company had to cut the price of the car by about half the value of the lost credit. Tuesday Tesla posted on X that “If there ever was a time to yolo your car purchase, it’s now,” referencing the upcoming tax credit expiration and using the acronym for “you only live once.” But Tesla has also faced missteps of Musk’s own doing. There has been backlash against Musk’s political activity, which has had a significant impact on Tesla sales. That is likely to continue even as he moves to distance himself from Trump. In the early months of this year, hundreds of protests were held outside Tesla showrooms in the United States, Canada and Europe. Worries about self-inflicted brand damage started the company’s shares on their downward slide. It prompted Trump, who was still Musk’s ally at the time, to announce he was buying a Tesla for himself. In March, the president hosted an event at the White House urging others to buy the company’s cars. At one point, Musk and Tesla investors might have hoped that in a closely divided country, the lost sales to Trump critics might be at least partly made up for by sales to Trump fans. But Musk seems to now face the possibility of backlash from both sides of the political spectrum. “He’s been able to alienate everyone, which many thought was impossible, but he’s actually been able to do it,” Ives told CNN Monday. “And the problem is, this soap opera just keeps going on.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Shopping Writer for HuffPost With tariffs still threatening to make products more expensive, 2025’s Prime Day deals couldn’t have come at a better time. It’s worth jumping on big sales when they appear so you aren’t stuck paying significantly higher prices on items like personal electronics, tools and foreign goods with the fluctuating economy. According to previous HuffPost coverage, price hikes can affect multiple categories, including tech, major kitchen appliances, Korean skin care and more. Products in all of these categories are on sale for Prime Day July 8 through 11, so we rounded up some of the best deals to help you save on these investments and prevent yourself from having to pay even higher prices for the items you want. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective. Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval. This 10-liter air fryer has 17 preset settings and three racks, with a maximum temperature of 400 degrees. You can bake, air fry, dehydrate or even used the included rotisserie spit to cook a rotisserie chicken. There's also a drip tray to catch messes on the bottom and make cleanup easier. You can clean the air in rooms up to 1,076 feet with this large room air purifier, which has dual air intakes to purify twice as fast (it only needs 60 minutes for a room that size). It operates nearly silent at just 24 dB, and you can choose between four fan speeds or just set it to automatic mode and let it choose for you based on the air quality. There's also a timer with three settings, so you can set it and forget it. The air purifier comes in black or white. Made by the K-beauty company Medicube, this collagen face mask is made to be worn over and can boost your skin's elasticity while you sleep. In addition to collagen, the mask contains skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerin and ceramide NP for hydration, skin barrier maintenance, addressing fine lines and other benefits. The mask dries down in 15 minutes and is designed to peel off easily in one piece for little mess. According to previous HuffPost coverage, home improvement items like tools may be affected by tariffs, so why not stock up on them at a discount while you can? This kit from trusted brand Dewalt contains a cordless oscillating multi-tool, 20V Max battery, blades for cutting wood, a sanding pad with sandpaper and other handy tools. It all comes with a handy tool bag and a storage box. Reviewers say the oscillating tool works on rubber, metal, plastic and wood. More advanced than your average speaker, this amplifier can upgrade your home entertainment system with 60 watts per channel by connecting to your TV, record player and other speakers. The amp is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, and you can stream Spotify, Amazon Music and more directly from it. You can use the WiiM app to adjust the volume and other settings from anywhere. A must-have home improvement tool, this cordless drill by Black + Decker uses a 20V Max battery to operate and comes with a charger. The drill features LED lights for visibility, an 11-position clutch and a variable speed trigger for easy control. There's also a built-in bit holder for easy storage. Having an extra screen can help you see everything at once when you're working on a computer or smaller device. This Arzopa monitor has a 1080P, 15.6-inch display that can connect to your other devices with a USB-C cable. The monitor has a dual speaker system to deliver powerful audio, and can connect to a Mac, PC, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and more. Great for a small space like an apartment, dorm or even RV, this portable dishwasher can go right on the countertop and can hold up to two full place settings, or 30+ items. It only consumes 6 liters of water per cycle using the built-in tank, and has five washing programs in addition to an auto-open function and a UV sterilization function. You can even use this to wash fruit. You might be familiar with Cosrx's snail mucin essence, which we've covered here at HuffPost many times. But the essence isn't the only snail mucin product out there — Cosrx also makes this snail mucin moisturizer, which we found to be at a steeper discount. The cream has 92% snail mucin for moisturizing and exfoliating, along with hyaluronic acid. The cream is lightweight and can address redness, dryness and even acne scars. Get two gadgets in one with this dual air purifier and fan from Dyson. The fan circulates air and keeps you cool while the purifier works to trap pollutants in the HEPA filter. You can use Dyson's app to track changes in air quality and pre-set the machine for intervals between 30 minutes and 8 hours. The fan also features a night mode that operates more quietly so it won't disturb your sleep. The Google Nest Thermostat allows you to track your energy consumption, offers recommendations for when it's best to use in-house heating or cooling systems, as well as offers complete control of a home's temperature even when users aren't at home. The thermostat is designed to work without a C wire in most homes and doesn't require professional help to install nor the need for any other Google smart home devices. A lesser known — but perhaps just as good as — alternative to the uber-expensive Dyson Airwrap is the Shark FlexStyle multi-styler, a tool that utilizes the same reverse directional airflow technology and functionality as the famed predecessor, but with some added ergonomic differences. The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls. This tool comes with up to five attachments to meet your styling needs whether you're creating bouncy curls, salon-style blowouts or smoothing frizz. Promising review: "I have been using this beautiful instrument for the past few months and I have to say it is definitely a major time saver in the morning.It’s pretty easy to find your groove with the tool after the first few uses. I will say the handle is long with the curling attachment so I just adjust my grip towards the center of the handle and it actually feels way more balanced. Definitely a tool I enjoy to use for my hair and would recommend!" — Ben This well-known stick vacuum from Dyson makes vacuuming easier than ever thanks to its lightweight body and extra-portable cordless design, with two powerful cleaning modes so you can tailor its suction to the job at hand while enjoying up to 40 minutes of cord-free runtime. Those with pets (or long hair) will also appreciate how effectively this thing traps fur and hair without getting strands tangled in its brush. Plus, it's designed to capture an impressive 99.99% of dust and other allergens in its filter for a cleaner home and cleaner air. Bose infused its signature high-fidelity sound and powerful noise-canceling technology into these over-the-ear wireless headphones that offer 20 hours of listening per charge. Enjoy 11 levels of active noise canceling and a microphone system that allows you to take calls and be heard, even in noisy environments.

You can use it to remove makeup or SPF, or as part of a double-cleansing routine to prevent your pores from clogging. According to the brand, you may begin to see a decrease in your skin's production of sebum (the oily substance your skin produces that can clog and cause breakouts) in as little as four weeks. Instantly get coffee shop-quality espresso in the comfort of your home with this wildly popular full-service espresso machine. Lattes, Americanos, cappuccinos and espresso shots are pulled to precision alongside a built-in conical burr grinder that grinds beans on demand and a frother wand for making perfectly delicious steamed milk.It’s the stuff coffee dreams are made of. HuffPost Shopping managing editor Emily Ruane raves about this Breville machine. “I did as much research as I could and this model seemed to be a popular and well-reviewed option,” she said. “The Breville was pricy, but it gets used at least twice a day. I wake up every morning looking forward to a perfect latte and I truly feel so fortunate to be able to enjoy this convenience at home.” Anker's Soundcore Bluetooth speaker is an outdoor-ready and super portable device that delivers crystal-clear sound with enhanced bass and zero distortion thanks to an advanced digital signal processor. This 12W speaker is also completely waterproof so you can enjoy up to 24 hours of listening time per charge no matter where you are. It's possible you've seen some version of these overnight hydrogel masks on TikTok that start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into skin, leaving behind a complexion that's plump, hydrated and glass-like. These Biodance masks contain a collagen-peptide that's of a low molecular weight to penetrate deeper into the skin. It also has brightening niacinamide, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and galactomyces to improve skin tone and texture. These high-quality headphones are currently retailing for just $35. Enjoy up to 32 hours of battery life and if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes.

Choose between multiple brew types and strengths, including an iced coffee setting. Given what we know about Bose and the brand's reputation for unbeatable sound, the deal on this TV soundbar is worth a mention. Connectible with Bluetooth or an HDMI cable, the speaker offers a wide natural sound and spatial audio for an immersive listening experience. Stop misplacing your keys by attaching them to a Bluetooth tracker. Tile by Life360 Mate uses an app to help you locate whatever item you attach it to.

Title: Tesla robotaxi incidents spark confusion and concerns in Austin

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two weeks into Tesla’s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety. Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who’ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses. The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver’s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles. Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it’s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they’re concerned about several incidents — documented on camera and shared on social media — where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who’ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla’s share price. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government. In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why. In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back. Some elected officials in Austin said they’re worried about the incidents. “There are just a lot of errors,” said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. “They have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.” And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn’t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government — which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust. “Tesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I’m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites’ safety,” she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla’s service halted for now. Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried. “We’ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,” he said. He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there. It’s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court. The Austin Police Department said in a statement: “As with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,” the department said. Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency “is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.” Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously. “I think that it’s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,” she said. Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 — the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law. Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company’s driver-assistance software. “I’ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,” she said. “I’ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.” Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla’s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear. Tesla’s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service. The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms. The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. “Take a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,” the person’s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment. Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service. “I was totally trusting of the technology,” she said in a YouTube video on her channel, “Ellie in Space.” She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car’s audio system to say that she couldn’t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.) Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla’s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach. “Elon must have a reason for why he believes in that,” she said. She’s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they’ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: “flawless,” “seamless” and “history-making.” But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren’t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand. Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla’s already-converted choir of supporters. Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google’s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla’s most enthusiastic fans are “all fairly convinced that it’s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don’t see it.” Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they’re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven. “What matters is not individual demonstrations. It’s statistics,” he said. Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 — six and a half years ago. Waymo began “rider only” rides in 2019. Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water. One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being “flooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. … The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.” The top comment on the post asked for a truce. “I want to see progress by both companies,” the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. “Waymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.” “I just want cars to drive themselves,” they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment. David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. Bruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: The Graduate: A Slick BMW Boxer Bobber Built From R65 and R100 Parts

Time Published: 2025-07-04T17:01:01Z
Full Content:
You might not know Sam Clercx’s name, but you’ve seen his work. He launched his career at the tender age of 15 as an intern at Ironwood Motorcycles, under the guidance of Arjan van den Boom. He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine. Most of my friends had jobs in supermarkets or cafés and I was helping build these amazing-looking and sounding custom bikes.” The niggles associated with classic motorcycles are partly why meneer van den Boom hit pause on Ironwood a few years ago. But Sam still has an affinity for the beloved BMW boxer motor. So he built up this R65 basket case as a side project, while completing another internship—this time at Motoism in Munich. “After Arjan closed up his shop and stopped building his boxers, I got a chance to buy a 1979 BMW R65 in parts, for cheap,” says Sam. “Thanks, in part, to Arjan and other people building wonderful machines out of these old R-series BMWs, the prices rose significantly, putting a nice riding rolling base out of my price range. I grabbed the opportunity and slowly started envisioning my perfect twin-valve custom.” “With a tight budget, but plenty of time, I picked up the neglected R65 in boxes. The short R65 frame and swingarm, paired with R100 cylinders, pistons, and heads, offered an affordable path to the quick, agile airhead I always wanted.” In stock form, the R100 makes about 25 hp more than the R65—so rebuilding the engine with R100 parts was a good call on Sam’s part. He also added BMW R100RS badges to the engine block to tease the engine’s true capacity, and adorned the heads with classic peanut covers. The airbox was swapped for pod filters, and the space it left behind was filled with a 3D-printed cover, housing a NOCO NLP9 battery. Sam scalped more R100 parts for the front end, fitting the lowered forks and twin Brembo brakes from a BMW R100RS. The R65 retains its drum brake and snowflake rims, which are now shod with Shinko E-270 tires. “It was a great help throughout the build to have a lot of spare parts from Arjan sitting in my garage,” he adds. “Small stuff like seals, throttle cables, and a lot of wiring—but also some nice bling parts.” A pair of aftermarket shocks props up the rear, connected to a custom-made stepped subframe. Lower down, the unsightly brackets that normally hold the mufflers and passenger pegs were trimmed down, leaving just enough space for the latter. “While style was obviously important, I didn’t want to sacrifice function,” Sam adds. “There are, of course, more practical bikes out there, but I set out to strike a balance between function and form: keeping it a two-seater and asking the talented Tom Hurley to make the seat as comfortable and waterproof as possible, while keeping it slim; adding tie-down points under the seat for my luggage; and fitting modern LEDs for good visibility at night, along with reliable electronics. I’m a rider first and a builder second.” Keeping with this philosophy, Sam fabricated a pair of short fenders for the bike and protected the fork stanchions with fresh rubber boots. A chromed LED headlight sits out front, nailing the mix of classic style and modern reliability that Sam was after. The headlight is neatly tucked into a 3D-printed fairing that was inspired by the plug-and-play fork covers that Motoism produces. It includes integrated Motoism turn signals, with a tidy housing for a slim Motogadget Motoscope Mini speedo up top. Other Motogadget bits include the bike’s keyless RFID ignition, and the company’s mo.unit blue module, around which the whole bike was rewired. The fairing also helps to route the cockpit’s cables and houses, making for an uber-neat setup. Wide handlebars sport vintage-style grips, a MessnerMoto throttle, and modern push-buttons with internal wiring. Tarozzi foot controls round out the control package. Motoism’s influence is clear in the BMW’s rear lighting too. Sam designed and 3D-printed his own taillight housing, equipping it with powerful LED internals. The rear turn signals are Motoism parts too, but the bracket that holds them is a one-off. The boxer’s glorious two-into-one exhaust headers were created by Sam’s good friend Chiel Nipius (of Nius Moto). They’re matched to a Spark silencer to create an appropriately throaty rumble. The most striking thing about this BMW boxer bobber is how well judged every last part and finish is—from the refinished motor to the period-correct pin striping and blacked-out tank roundels. “The color scheme was inspired by a picture of a classic Porsche 356 convertible I found—black leather, chrome silver, and this stunning blue,” explains Sam. “It was perfectly executed by Royal Kustom Works on the tank, fenders, and front fairing.” Now that his BMW R65/R100 is complete, Sam plans to take it on a few trips before selling it to make way for the next project. But first, it’s being exhibited as his official graduation project at the Utrecht School of the Arts. If it were up to us, we’d give him full marks.

Title: I’m a retiree with $900k cash but no home. How do I make it last? - Mary Holm

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. There's no need for your 80s to be sad. Photo / 123RF Q: I am a twice-married woman of 70. I have not come out of either marriage settlement well. For six years now, I’ve been living with a friend in a large, comfortable home. However, it is not a great situation and I really need to be out of it. My problem is that I have three children with families who all live in the Auckland area, and I would like to be located so that I can see them easily. They all lived offshore for a long time and now they are all here. I am so lucky. I have all up around $1 million, although $100,000 is on loan to my daughter to enable her to buy a home. My only income is the pension (I guess you’ve heard this all before!), but I am hopeful of living these next few years as I would like to live. Clearly, my 80s look sad. I am English-born, lived in Australia and met my Kiwi husband and moved to NZ. My 20-year marriage ended, and five years later I met my second husband. We had a business together which was successful, but he mismanaged our funds (he being the only director) and then left to live a nomadic life! My circumstances need to be addressed. I do not know if renting is wise as I’d hate to continually move, and my money would only allow me to buy something tiny anywhere near my only family in NZ. Is there any solution to this? I have been harbouring this problem for far too long, and I must move on. A: Let’s set you on a more positive path – not just for now but for your future. There’s no need for your 80s or beyond to be sad. I think renting, rather than tying up your savings in a small property that doesn’t appeal to you, is the way to go. You’ve got $900,000 available now. If you plan to live on that from now until you’re 90, you could spend $45,000 a year – in addition to NZ Super - even if you were earning no return on the savings. But if you earn 3% a year, after fees and tax, you could spend $60,000 a year – or $5000 a month - according to an online regular withdrawal calculator. What about when you’re 90? Many people report they can live comfortably on just NZ Super at that stage – although they tend to be homeowners. But by then, it would surely be reasonable for your daughter to repay your $100,000 loan, which you could use to supplement your Super. There are a few issues to consider here: If you prefer to just put the lot in bank deposits, your return would probably average above 2% a year after tax, and you could spend $4500 a month. You can make this work! Footnote 1: Cash-poor retired homeowners might want to consider selling their homes and renting in much the same way. Many people wouldn’t dream of doing that. But they would have considerably more spending money. Footnote 2: In your story, there is a message for other women whose husbands run the money side of a joint business: Be involved. Please. Q: I write regarding last week’s letter about landlords being charitable for too long and needing to raise rents. Landlords need to remember that their market is individuals with limits on what they can pay in rent. These individuals are not a charity to support indigent landlords. Of course, landlords can raise rents, but they may not find tenants. I see this in the apartment block where I own my home. Rents range from $500 per week for a studio to $750 for a two-bedroom. Lovely tenants moved out because the landlord raised the rent at lease renewal time. Apartments have been vacant for weeks until landlords got more realistic and reduced the asking price, in at least one case to below the previous rent. My renting neighbours are professionals on good incomes, the only people who can afford to rent here. I am a single superannuitant and could not afford to rent an apartment in my building. As an owner, my outgoings are around $6500 per annum, which I can afford. Obviously, a landlord’s outgoings also include mortgage repayments. But with the substantial rents my neighbours pay, I am surprised that landlords can’t cover their costs, particularly now that interest is tax-deductible. Possibly some landlords didn’t look carefully at risks and returns and are too highly geared, but I don’t see why tenants should pay for landlords’ poor business decisions. A: Your observations are interesting. A key factor in how well a rental property investment works for the landlord is the size of their mortgage. With no mortgage, most rents would easily cover expenses, but with a large mortgage, the interest payments can kill the short-term profitability. On the other hand, the bigger the mortgage, the bigger the long-term return the landlord stands to gain on their original investment – as long as property values rise. That’s the risk highly geared property investors take. Usually it works, or certainly has in the past. But if property values fall or stagnate, landlords with big mortgages they are struggling to pay are sometimes forced to sell at a loss. Expecting tenants to rescue them by paying rent above market rates is unrealistic. Q: You get lots of letters from landlords that focus on the social service they are doing by having properties that people can rent. There is no question that we need a stock of rental properties, but there are two points that many seem to miss. The first is that landlords, when they purchase properties to rent out, add demand to a limited supply of properties, and help raise the price. Secondly, when they threaten to leave the market, they will argue that there will be fewer properties for people to rent. That’s not true if the property is bought by another landlord. And if it’s bought by someone moving from rental to home ownership, then there is also one less person looking to rent. Unless they decide to leave the property vacant - highly unlikely - the total number of houses does not change when a landlord exits the market. A: You’re quite right on both points. If someone wants to own more than one house – so they can rent one property out – that must push up demand, and therefore prices. Several other readers also made your second point. One added that, if a previous tenant is able to buy a house from a landlord who has left the market, “from an overall societal perspective, this is a very good thing”. Also, she says, “I understand that the new healthy homes regulations are persuading some landlords to sell. Brilliant.” More on landlords and tenants next week. Q: Many years ago, I would read your weekly NZ Herald Q&A commentary (back in the days when the paper was known as conservative Granny Herald). Your bias against residential rental property was evident. You pushed for a capital gains tax and now quite possibly want a wealth tax in NZ. I also recall that your underlying views appeared to be somewhat socialist. Beyond this, I appreciate that you were giving advice to those who were not as financially literate as yourself. Over the many years my rental properties have appreciated in value, and now that, at retirement, I am mortgage-free, I have plenty of income and the benefit of capital gains. Also excellent long-term tenants and nicely renovated properties. Landlords have been particularly demonised in the last 10 or so years, and a culture of envy has developed against those who work to get ahead. We now have so many on a benefit (including NZ Super) that we have become unproductive as a nation. So the few work hard to support those who either don’t want to work or who can’t. I chanced upon an item online from your column back on February 24 last year asking the question, “Should we, the uber-rich and ‘chauffeured’!, be retiring ... at 85!” - whilst I was researching how I can financially help family by setting up a super fund for them, here and in Oz. Surely you are taking the mickey and invented this story? Otherwise, the couple must have dementia or cognitive impairment to write this nonsense to you. If, by some stretch of the imagination, there was some truth to what this couple wrote, the only purpose in publishing it was to engender envy and hatred, or dismay at best. It is great to stir the pot of green envy in NZ, as the left need the support of their “besties”, the media, including columns like yours, to further their agenda. Also, no wonder trust in the media, as revealed in recent polls, is at an all-time low, including distrust of our institutions and politicians, who also introduce legislation by stealth. Not to mention experts whose comments are all “politicised” today, and a left-biased judiciary and universities. Constant cherry-picking, an unbalanced distortion of the facts, running to their own narrative and pushing their agenda. There are still more than a few of us who are immune to all the propaganda and were educated in free thought. I do fear many will be departing our shores, though, given the push to greater socialism and redistribution of wealth in this country, and the racial divisions and subsequent erosion of democracy. A: Gosh. It must be hard being unhappy with beneficiaries, people who get NZ Super, the media, institutions and politicians, the judiciary and universities. You’ve well and truly broken the 200-word limit for letters, but you raise some interesting points. My comments: You acknowledge that some people can’t work. Along with setting up financial help for your family, it would be wonderful if you donated to charities that support these people. It might make you happier – I mean that sincerely. * Mary Holm, ONZM, is a freelance journalist, a seminar presenter and a bestselling author on personal finance.
