ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Online education company TAL Education missed on the big three (revenue, net income, and earnings per share), despite top-line revenue growth increasing by +42% year-over-year, as selling, marketing, administrative expenses increased to $336 million from $24 million YoY, which weighed on bottom line net income and EPS. The company only used $13.1mm of its $490.7mm share repurchase program, which is strange to me. Thus far, no analyst has asked management about relisting in Hong Kong. I will provide a Hong Kong relisting update via Twitter (@ahern_brendan). Asian stocks were lower, except for Vietnam, which outperformed the region. This followed roller coaster comments Wednesday, as President Donald Trump suggested tariff rollbacks could be in the cards soon. China’s Ministry of Commerce threw cold water on Trump’s suggestion that talks are already in motion. The MoC said, “There are no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States, at present.” The comments indicate a lack of understanding that the "Art of the Deal" requires Kabuki theatre, drama, and showmanship. Hopefully, the two sides will communicate with one another at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington this week. Premier Li and the State Council once again reiterated that it is necessary to “stabilize the stock market and continue to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market." Mainland media outlet Yicai noted that U.S. shipments of liquid natural gas to China went to zero in March, versus 412,500 tons in March 2024, as China’s 99% LNG tariff and 94% oil tariff take hold. The European container shipping index futures fell -9% overnight. It is hard to know whether fewer boats going to the U.S. means more supply for Europe, leading to the price decline, or indicating the trade war is weighing on the global economy. Regardless, the two sides should get talking, in my humble opinion. Without question, the biggest news was declines in Meituan and JD.com shares, which fell -5.15% and -6.19%, respectively, overnight, as JD reported a substantial uptick in its new restaurant delivery service. The likely price war is apt to weigh on the companies’ financials. JD.com, as the leader in online electronic sales, was well-positioned to benefit from the new electronic subsidies through the expansion into restaurant delivery, curbing investor enthusiasm. The price action seems to be an instance of "shooting first and asking questions later, " as investors recall self-defeating battles, including that between Didi and Uber. Internet stocks were off, as defensive plays such as banks, nonferrous metals, mining, and telecom outperformed. It is worth noting that Southbound Stock Connect had $436 million worth of net buying, concentrated in Alibaba and Meituan. Mainland investors now hold 8.64% of Alibaba’s shares outstanding. Southbound Stock Connect's percentage ownership continues to rise. Tencent is 11.78% owned by Mainland investors, Kuaishou is 15.76% owned, and Meituan is 10.96% owned, based on shares outstanding. Today, 43% of Hong Kong’s turnover was via Southbound, which indicates the lack of foreign investor participation, which was out of sight, and out of mind. Mainland China had a non-eventful night, as banks and insurance outperformed, battery giant CATL gained +1.51%, and Midea gained +1.53%. These were rare growth outperformers in the current market. Software and technology, including electronic equipment and communications equipment, underperformed. The National Team’s favored ETFs had very light volumes. Carmaker BYD reports Friday.

Why he didn’t see this coming Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts For a while, it seemed as if DOGE Elon and Tesla Elon could exist in the same space-time continuum. One of them carried out Donald Trump’s ruthless cost-cutting mission while the other pitched cars that appealed most to people who were highly likely to oppose that mission, or even rage against it. As activists spray-painted STOP DOGE on Teslas at dealerships and anti-Tesla protests spread all over the world, there still was no concrete proof that Elon Musk had to amend either version of himself. Then this week came Tesla’s first quarterly earnings report since Musk started his work with DOGE, showing the company’s profits down 71 percent from the same time last year. After a conference call, one major investor said Musk was “delusional.” Suddenly it seemed as if Musk was on a “Kanye West–like trajectory,” according to Patrick George, editor in chief of InsideEVs and our guest this week on Radio Atlantic. George has been covering Tesla since the 2010s. He’s watched Musk shoot himself in the foot in the lead-up to this moment, so he is well placed to understand why Musk didn’t see this coming. In this week’s episode, the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel interviews George about how Musk found himself in this predicament. The following is a transcript of the episode: News clip: Growing backlash against Elon Musk and his new role in President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE— News clip: Protestors taking out their anger on the Tesla car and owners were busy all over the country— News clip: Tesla, the car company Musk founded and runs, has seen its stock price fall dramatically, as you can see from this chart— As Patrick George, the editor in chief of InsideEVs, wrote in The Atlantic this week: Luck runs out. Patrick George: I think he thought he would come in and gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader and that everything would’ve worked out great just the way it always has. He’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are, you know—they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here. [Music] Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin, and this is Radio Atlantic. My colleague Charlie Warzel interviewed Patrick George recently about the tumultuous journey Tesla’s been on, from darling of the environmentally conscious to target of tire slashing. And the two of them land on Musk’s blind spot, which caused him to miss this coming crash. Charlie Warzel: Patrick George, welcome to Radio Atlantic. Thank you for joining me. George: Great to be here, Charlie. Thanks for having me. Rosin: Their conversation explains so well how we got to this moment. George: Covering Tesla in the 2010s, the kind of hate mail we would get from people whenever we’d criticize the company or put something negative in one of the reviews of the Tesla, whatever—there were so many people back then who were such true believers in what he was doing, I mean, thinking that he’s saving the world. And I’m kind of sad for those folks now who really believed in this environmental mission of the company. Those are the ones who are dumping their Teslas. Those are the ones who feel abandoned right now, who feel betrayed by this guy they once believed in who has very much gone to what they perceive as the dark side. Warzel: What has been going through your head over the last few months as we’re watching, you know, Musk take this role in the government and have this interplay between his polarization and the stock? George: You know, every now and then, I have to step back when I read a sentence in the news or I even write a sentence on InsideEVs or for The Atlantic—you know, something like, President Trump holds a White House “summit” full of Teslas, you know, amid widespread protests against Elon Musk, his chief advisor and government cost cutter, that are happening all over the world, including vandalism. And I just stepped back, and I’m like, How did we get here? Like, is someone putting LSD in my coffee every morning? Like, this is just such a baffling, bizarre outcome from the way that Tesla’s trajectory has worked for the longest time and where it’s at now. You know, for lack of a better term, it’s kind of insane, honestly. When I started covering Tesla, and I was a young writer at Jalopnik—I started at the end of 2012. And one of the first things I did was my then–editor in chief, Matt Hardigree, and I—we interviewed Elon Musk from the Tesla factory floor when they were trying to get the Model S up and running. You know, the first car was the Roadster. And that was kind of a science project, honestly. It was a Lotus Elise stuffed with laptop batteries, more or less. And the Model S was their first real car. And they were trying to get it ramped up. And we talked to him, on the factory floor. And I remember, you know, him being at the time very tired but, you know, charming, smart, but also self-deprecating. We were doing stories on those early Model S’s is having all kinds of quality problems. And he was going, Yeah, we’re working on it, but we’re doing this Herculean effort to get it up and running. And, you know, I still think the Model S—the original one—is the most important car of the 21st century, because that was what proved the case of electric vehicles for the whole world. Because they were golf carts before that. They were, you know, the Nissan Leaf Codas, things like that. And it became this It Car in Hollywood. You probably remember this. Everybody—all the celebrities were trading in their Prius for the Model S. And it was fast, and it was sexy. I mean, it could smoke a Porsche 911 in a drag race. Like, a Prius couldn’t do that. And over time, we covered this guy and his company. It’s like, Hey! Here’s this quirky guy who’s kind of breaking all the rules, and he’s doing some cool stuff, and he’s also clearly an asshole too. And he’s insane about some things. But what they’re coming up with is this really interesting alternative to gas. And I can just say personally, you know, by the end of the last decade, I kind of realized that this is the future. This isn’t just a niche alternative to gasoline. It’s the future. And that wouldn’t have happened without Tesla. But there are so many shades along the way of what happened with him that kind of inform where we’re at now, just the way that he treated the press, the way that he treated open access to his company, the way that he treated his own public image, the sort of vindictiveness against his enemies. He can be very vain, certainly. He’s very obsessed with his own public image, you know, very vindictive—obviously, calling that cave diver the “pedo guy” or getting in a huge amount of trouble for saying he had the funds to take Tesla private. He had this Kanye West–like trajectory. It’s like, This guy’s brilliant, but he’s also horrible. And over time, the horrible part of him sort of overtakes that. But, you know, this amount of wealth that he amassed came with this tremendous amount of power. And I think he has gotten really into his own myth and own legend about exercising that power in unprecedented ways. Warzel: So I’ve always been fascinated with the correlation between Tesla’s stock price and Musk as a persona. There’s an analyst at Moody’s who said, quote, “I do think fundamentally that a significant fraction of Tesla’s value is due to the fact that Elon can command this attention continuously,” which sort of suggested to me that Musk is almost like a human meme stock. So I’m kind of curious: How much do you think Tesla’s value is just tied to this future projection of Elon Musk as this guy who’s going to, you know, either have that Edison-esque ability to innovate beyond any constraints or just that, you know, he can kind of brute force his way into making the future bend to his will? George: I think that the value of the company, the image of the company, is extremely driven by him and by his involvement in it. Another analyst we talk to a lot who’s one of the most bullish of all Tesla bulls, Dan Ives at Wedbush, you know, he says repeatedly, Elon is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story. And he said that Elon is Tesla and Tesla is Elon. The idea is that he has had so much success and he’s generated so much value for the company before that surely he’ll do it again, and he’ll keep doing it, and he’s the key driver of that. I’m not sure there is a company in modern times that is so intrinsically linked to one person. Probably the closest analog was Apple and Steve Jobs. I mean, this has also led to kind of lack of accountability with Musk, too, because I think that at any other company, certainly any company in the auto industry that we would cover, if you’ve seen the value of the company get so tanked this hard over a number of months, that person, that CEO would’ve been shown the door by now. But there is this belief that Musk is uniquely the one person who will deliver the future. And that’s something he’s built up himself. Certainly, that’s a myth he’s built up himself. I go back to the early days of Tesla, right? The really early days, like, in the 2000s, there was a New York Times article about Tesla Motors and what they were doing. And Musk—before he was CEO, he was just, like, an angel investor and heavily involved in the company—was furious because it didn’t mention him at all. So he always wanted his image to be wrapped up in that. Long before he owned Twitter, he was one of the central figures on Twitter and really used Twitter to get around traditional media and get around press releases and events and things like that to reach that audience directly and build up a following directly. And you said the phrase meme stock earlier. We hear that quite a bit now, and it’s like, okay, admitting that Musk is damaging the company or wanting him out, that will collapse a lot of that value. So, like, there is an incentive to sort of keep this vibe—I almost want to say grift—going, so it keeps, you know, printing money as it has before. Warzel: I think this protest movement is extremely fascinating. I was in the Bay Area recently, and I was blown away. The person I was visiting used to own a Tesla, and they said— George: Used to? Warzel: Yeah. And, well, this was a while back. But they said that the person they sold it to, a friend, had it keyed the other day. Even just on a very small scale, if it’s not a protest, there seems to be lots of acts of, like, casual vandalism and things like that. And then, as recently as March, I think there was a protest at nearly every Tesla dealership in the United States. So the movement seems to be somewhat durable. And yet I think the very initial parts of this protest we watched coincide with a pretty substantial drop in the stock, so much so that you have Elon Musk and Donald Trump basically doing a Tesla infomercial on the White House South Lawn, right? Teslas and EVs have always had a political valence, but does Tesla have a clear idea of what its brand is now? Because I don’t know if it’s going to sort of reclaim that green, progressive halo anytime in the near future. George: I actually do think that the backlash against Tesla is the biggest crisis it’s ever faced, bigger than when it was a tiny start-up trying to get its first real car out in ’08, when the world was crashing—bigger than when COVID happened, and it had to shut down its factories. I think this is the biggest crisis it has ever faced as a company. And you said at the beginning of our chat, Charlie, the word polarizing, right? And Tesla’s interesting because it’s always been a polarizing brand. Like, when it was embraced by liberals and Californians and the Hollywood crowd, you know, like, the rest of America was like, Hey, you have a Tesla. You’re so smug. You know, you’re saving the world, huh? And now it’s kind of flipped on its head, right? Now you have all of these folks in California who are trying—and kind of everywhere, they’re trying—to get rid of their Teslas, like Democratic-leaning, progressive-leaning, even center-leaning people who are done with the brand because of Elon, because of DOGE. Meanwhile, you have Fox News defending him left and right, saying that he’s an American hero who must be protected at all costs. And you know, Pam Bondi saying she’s going to stick up for him. I mean, what a bizarre reversal this is. And at the same time, there is no evidence we have seen that buyers in red states, more conservative-leaning folks, are going to be flocking the Teslas en masse. Like, I don’t want to stereotype here, but there are many, many studies and data points that we’ve reported on over the years that show that conservative-leaning voters are more skeptical of electric vehicles than liberal-leaning folks are. And that’s a climate-change thing. And it’s also just, like, how they’ve been trained to view EVs over the years, you know? So it’s like, Are you for EVs or not? You want Elon to succeed, but you’re not going to buy his car. You know, like, I have family in deep-red Texas, and, you know, when we were down there recently, everyone was saying, Elon’s the best. He’s great. He’s, you know, cutting government waste. It’s like, Okay, well, would you buy one of his cars? Absolutely not. No. It’s like, that is a problem—that is a problem with them being able to sell cars. And my personal theory is: The ultimate test of this is going to be the new Model Y, which just came out. And, you know, for those of you who don’t know, and I bet there’s a good amount of people listening to this who probably own a Model Y, this is the best-selling EV in the world. By some metrics, that’s the best-selling car in the world. There’s a new one out. It looks a little different. The specs are better. It has more range. They fixed the interior up. It’s nicer. All things equal, this should be the best-selling car in the world again. This should pull a repeat. And if this thing doesn’t sell, if it has lousy—you know, it just went on sale now, so we’re not going to know in the first quarter, but if a Q2, Q3, Q4 rolls around and this thing is sitting on dealer lots unsold, that is an existential problem for Tesla. That’s a disaster moment for them. I think that would be the ultimate proof that they have totally alienated any potential buyers or fans that they might have once had. Warzel: But at the same time, we just talked in this conversation about Musk’s, you know, ability to buoy the company and the stock. Do you think that is under threat, essentially? George: Yeah. And that’s where the disconnect is, right? Is because the stock price at Tesla is all predicated on future stuff. It’s solving autonomous driving. It’s robotaxis. It’s artificial intelligence, which Musk has gotten really into in recent years. It’s predicated on robots too. Like, they see the future as automation. It’s not car sales. It’s not duking it out with Nissan and Volkswagen over market share. Like, he doesn’t think that’s going to propel the company to its, you know, trillion-dollar value and take him to the stars and help him start his Mars colony someday if he’s just, you know, selling cars. When we’re talking about why its value is so high, it’s not just because Elon is great. It’s because for the last decade, Elon Musk has been personally promising that self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis are, you know, about a year away—something he’s been saying since 2016, about. You know, that is the value of the company. That’s where all that money is wrapped up. It’s the idea that this company specifically will solve self-driving cars. Never mind the fact that, you know, Google’s Waymo has years more experience—you know, many, many, many miles more experience. Warzel: Yeah, they’re on the roads. George: They’re on the roads. Yeah. You could go to—what?—half a dozen cities in America and use a Waymo. So they’re years ahead of Tesla at actually getting a quote-unquote “robotaxi” service on the road. But there’s still that belief, with all they’ve invested, that they’ll be the ones to deliver autonomous cars one day. That’s the “valuation of Tesla” part of it. But it’s still a car company. Its revenue still comes from being a car company. Its revenue still comes from other car companies buying regulatory credits—meaning, you know, they pollute so much so they buy credits from Tesla to offset their polluting. That’s a huge source of their revenue. So he may have these grand dreams of robots and space and AI and everything else, but right now, it does need to sell cars. It does need to move metal. And if it can’t do that and the revenue tanks, you know, you can forget AI and robotaxis. And the other thing I think about, too, is supposedly they’re going to be launching their robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Okay. Right. Well, if he’s made this brand so caustic and so controversial, who’s going to want to use that service? I mean, is it really going to be some widespread thing like Uber, or are people going to go out of their way to avoid it? And I think that latter outcome is a very real possibility here. [Music] Warzel: When we’re back, I ask Patrick George to explain why Tesla’s crisis may be existential for reasons beyond Elon Musk. [Break] Warzel: So putting aside Musk just a moment here: The protests we’ve mentioned have been noticeable. I’m curious: What are the non-Musk-related threats to Tesla, right? We have Tesla having this real, genuine, first-mover advantage, especially in the United States. But it’s not alone anymore. You’ve got Rivian. You’ve got Polestar. You’ve got, you know, a series of EV competitors. Taking the Musk and Trump out of it, what does the company have to worry about right now? George: Yeah, let’s start with competition, right? Because it’s not just the start-ups you mentioned. It’s that Tesla sparked this industry-wide shift towards electrification. And when we say electrification, that means more hybrids and eventually a move to an all-EV market. And this started in kind of the middle-end of the last decade, when all of these traditional automakers started chasing Tesla’s value. Like, when you’re Ford or you’re Toyota, you’re looking at Tesla like, Why the hell are they valued so much more than we are? Like, we need to be like Tesla. We need to become tech companies. We need to electrify. And it took them years to do it. And, I mean, let’s be honest. Like, not all of them are pulling this off, this transformation from being traditional carmakers to being, you know, makers of software and battery-powered vehicles. Like, this is all we write about at InsideEVs. It’s just the struggles to do that. But they’re getting there. And some of them are now surpassing Tesla in many ways. Like, you can buy a Hyundai or a Kia with more range than a Tesla has, and faster charging. There’s stuff Volvo’s coming out with that has, you know, 400-plus miles of range. There’s better performance from cars like Audi now that are electric also. So Tesla started this, but they haven’t been able to keep up, and that’s been a huge criticism of this company for a long time, is they haven’t kept their product lineup fresh, as every company should. Like, there was the Cybertruck and then one update to the Model 3 sedan. Beyond that, there hasn’t really been a lot. And meanwhile, you have other companies coming out with, like, three-row SUVs and more crossovers and just more different options in the EV space. And that’s just in the West. The other problem is that once they set up shop in China, which Tesla’s Shanghai factory is what has provided them with stable long-term profits since the early part of this decade. But it also got the entire Chinese auto industry—took that baton and ran with it. And, I mean, you know, we see all the time—like, you probably heard the news last few weeks: The Chinese automaker BYD has a new technology for five-minute EV fast charging. Like, nothing in America comes close to that, and we probably won’t for a decade or more. So with its incredible industrial might, like, China is racing way ahead of Tesla, and Tesla’s kind of a stale brand there. So between the protests in America and Europe that are tanking sales, and the fact that Chinese buyers are moving on to other brands, like, I think the picture doesn’t look great for this company. Warzel: A big thing that I have seen as sort of an EV dilettante is the notion of, you know, especially in America, Tesla’s charging network, and that infrastructural portion being really important to the company. The idea of the BYD extremely fast chargers, like, are those, in your mind, existential threats to Tesla? George: Not any one thing, but put it all together, and yes. And remember what we said about how so much of Tesla’s value is locked up in solving autonomous cars? Well, BYD also has—they call it God’s Eye, an autonomous-driving system that they’re putting on, like, Toyota Corolla–priced vehicles in China. So, like, I can’t attest this myself. It’s obviously hard for us to test Chinese cars as extensively as we would here. But, like, this company claims to have done something Tesla’s promised for a long time, but a hell of a lot cheaper. Then you have faster charging. Then you have the fact that, you know, China’s full of—what?—two dozen Tesla-esque companies that are racing ahead. All these little things adding up, like, it’s like a dam bursting almost—that just all these things that this company pioneered, it can’t keep up with at scale. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions keep BYD and the other Chinese car companies out of our market for now. I personally tend to think that’s a temporary thing, at best, and that capitalism, even China’s version of it, tends to find a way. But, you know, once that happens and one of these automakers is able to sell in this country or even build cars in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee or whatever, and you know, the Americans can get a taste of something that far surpasses a Tesla for much cheaper, I think that’s going to be a real headache for that company. Warzel: Well, and as you’re saying all this, what’s running through my mind is this, like, complex threat matrix. You know, like, everyone’s sort of encircling Tesla in this way. And meanwhile, Elon Musk—who I said I was going to keep out of it for a second, but I have to bring him back in— it seems from the outside, was not paying any attention to any of this. George: Certainly busy, but he’s also remarkably tactical. I don’t believe, based on everything I’ve heard and read and interviewed, and associates I’ve talked to about the guy—like, he does think many moves ahead. And I think part of the reason that Tesla’s stock price shot up after the election was this belief that by working with Trump, Elon can sort of carve out a regulatory framework, get rid of regulations in America that limit the deployment of autonomous cars—like, essentially that by working with Trump, they could, you know, deploy autonomous cars and robotaxis more quickly nationally and in a way that’s favorable to Tesla. Because right now, the regulations governing autonomous cars are state by state. It’s municipality by municipality. It’s very patchwork. But if you had a federal framework, and if that framework was favorable to Tesla, you know, that is a game changer for their ability to deliver on the promise of their stock price. Like, that’s where my mind goes for the car company, specifically. And when Trump was still on the campaign trail right before the election, Elon said as much. He was basically up there being like, Yeah, we need a regulatory framework that’s going to work for autonomous cars. That’s all boring to say. But the idea is that when you watch Fox News and their defense of this great American business patriot, it’s just that he’s just a hero who is cutting government waste and getting rid of the deficit, when, in reality, I think that he used this to enrich his own companies and to clear out obstacles for the things he wants to do, especially when Tesla’s concerned for robotaxis. But that single-minded focus on autonomy and AI has meant they’ve taken their eye off the ball when it comes to products, when it comes to cars people can buy. And he’s been on record as saying that it’s pointless for us to come out with another car that has a steering wheel. Like, why would you do that? It’s like coming out with, like, a horse and buggy, but the technology’s not there yet. You know, for now at least, it does have to be a car company, and it does have to still do battle with Hyundai and General Motors and BYD, whether he wants it to or not. Warzel: It sounds like a very classic sort of—you know, as someone who’s followed Musk for a really long time—his obsession with the future, and I think genuine. Like, actual, genuine enthusiasm for the possibility of things. His sci-fi brain is so overactive that it causes this. Like, I’m sure that there’s an element of bullshitting here with, like, We’re going to be in Mars by 2030, and everyone’s going to be walking around. George: Been saying this stuff for 10-years-plus. Yeah. Warzel: But I think there is also a genuineness, too, right? Like, the steering-wheel thing feels very real to me, right? Like, This is right around the corner. Of course, we’re not going to build another car with the steering wheel. Meanwhile, every year that future pushes further and further away is another year that Tesla doesn’t have that product that can sort of fill the gap between his understanding of what is to come and the reality that, like, we’re just not there yet. George: Yeah. But this speaks to how they’ve been successful before. And it’s just—that’s the Musk mentality. You just kick down every door until you get what you want. And I go back to when they built the Model 3, you know, the first really affordable sedan. It’s not just that it’s a cheap electric car. It’s built in a completely different way than cars were built before. And the factory that builds it had to be completely reset from how car factories worked. It’s like, Just hit reset on everything, and just do it. That’s your goal. And you just do it. But they are running into technological limitations with how they do autonomous driving. Like, they are not there yet. And, like, I’ve used autopilot. I’ve used full self-driving for many years. I have seen it get better. Warzel: Those are Tesla features. George: Yeah, of course. Right. These are the self-driving Tesla features. I should say, they’re not really self-driving. This is what we would call a semi-autonomous driving-assistance system that kind of helps you on the highway or will take over some steering around town if we’re talking about full self-driving, and they’re getting better. Full self-driving tried to kill me on two separate occasions, Charlie, which really hurt my feelings. And it hasn’t done that in a while, but it’s still not a hundred percent. And for true autonomous driving to work, it has to be safer and better than a human every single time, in every single scenario. And they’re not there yet. Warzel: What is so difficult to put together for someone like myself—but I assume, also, a lot of different people who aren’t paying attention to Musk and Tesla, like, this granularly—we’re talking about an inability to fill the gap between the technological future of Musk’s imagination and the current moment, right? Do you think some of that is just, like, the margins of starting to, you know, suffer these consequences for not delivering? George: You know, a year ago, I kind of thought if Elon ever met his Waterloo, it would be his inability to deliver on these promises of autonomy and autonomous cars. Like, it would just get to the point where that technology’s just not there yet. You know? And maybe someday it will. I think on a long enough timeline, yeah—probably humans will not be driving cars. Maybe that’s 10 years from now or 100 years from now. I don’t know. But lately, I think that what may be his greatest downfall and what may be a kind of death blow to this company is his inability to understand people. He understands technology, but he doesn’t get people. And he has said, you know, empathy is a weakness. He doesn’t relate to other people well. You know, he’s blamed this on being neurodivergent, I guess. Either way, not a great people person. And I don’t think he counted on people abandoning the Tesla brand as furiously as they are, as quickly as they are, in response to him, in response to his actions with DOGE. I don’t think he counted on that. I think he thought he would come in and, you know, gut the federal government and be seen as this great crusader, and that everything would’ve worked out great, just the way it always has, as he’s had all this success before, right? But now, like, people are—you know, they’re running away from this company, and that might be the greatest failure of all here.

Title: Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

Title: US FTC Sues Uber For Charging Its Customers Without Consent

Time Published: 2025-04-23T12:30:27Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The United States (US) Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing application Uber on April 21 for allegedly charging customers for its Uber One subscription service, without their consent. The regulator has also argued that Uber failed to deliver on its promise of discounts and savings as part of Uber One. The ride-hailing app also allegedly made cancellation difficult despite stating that users can cancel the subscription anytime. To cancel Uber One, customers have to go through 12 different actions and go through “a maze of at least seven screens, if they guess the right paths to use, despite there being no mention of cancellation until the fourth screen.” FTC details that Uber auto-renews Uber One subscriptions and removes the cancellation button for the first 48 hours of the billing period. Even if the customer contacts customer service, the company’s representatives take too long to process cancellation requests. This leads to the customer incurring a subscription renewal charge once again. The company enrolled customers into Uber One through a variety of ways, including push notifications, pop-ups in the Uber App and the Uber Eats App, and so on. Through push notifications, it offers people savings on their next ride or food delivery. FTC claims that one such offer the company often presents to its customers is 50% off a one-year membership, and when a customer tries to claim the offer, the company offers the service for free. “Once consumers click the ‘Try for free’ button, they are immediately enrolled in Uber One and will be charged within four weeks, and on a recurring basis thereafter,” the FTC says. It emphasises that in none of these situations does the customer actively provide billing information for this subscription; instead, the company relies on the details it has stored if the customer has ever taken a ride with Uber. The FTC mentions that even before the four-week trial period ends, the company charges customers for the Uber One subscription. Further, if a customer is able to successfully cancel their free trial during the trial period, they immediately lose access to Uber One instead of losing access on the end date of the trial period. When the customer gets to the screen where they can cancel their subscription, Uber requires them to fill out a survey about the reason for cancellation. Till the customer clicks on one of the pre-specified answers to the survey question, it does not allow them to continue to cancel. If the customer clicks an answer and presses continue, a screen appears asking the customer if they want to consider pausing the membership instead. On this page, at the bottom of the page, a button labeled “Pause Uber One” appears prominently in a bright gray textbox, while beneath it is a button labeled “No thanks” in a subdued black textbox with white font. FTC specifies that neither of these buttons mention cancellation. “Further, these buttons are flipped from their placement on the previous screen: On the previous screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is on the top, whereas, on this screen, the button to click to proceed with cancellation is now on the bottom. This design interface steers the consumer who wishes to cancel away from the action they are trying to take,” the FTC emphasises. Just like the US, in India as well, customers are facing the menace of dealing with allegedly deceptive practices. According to a survey by the consumer community platform LocalCircles, eight out of ten users have encountered dark patterns on ride-hailing services like Ola and Uber. These are deceptive practices that mislead customers into doing things they did not intend to do. Local Circles found that 78% of customers face higher waiting times than what the ride-hailing apps state on their service. “We are glad to learn that the FTC has come down against the use of Dark Patterns by Uber. CCPA [Central Consumer Protection Agency] must take action on similar dark patterns concerns raised by consumers in India against taxi aggregators,” Sachin Taparia, Founder of LocalCircles, told MediaNama. Notably, in December last year, the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Pralhad Joshi, took stock of the reports surrounding ride-hailing apps charging people differently based on whether they booked rides through an Android or Apple device. He said that such differential pricing was prima facie an unfair trade practice, and that he has instructed the CCPA to examine price discrepancies in ride-hailing as well as other sectors.

Title: Elon Musk made big promises for Tesla, but 2 products are key to a rebound
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-analysts-react-earnings-robotaxis-affordable-cars-plan-timing-profit-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-23T09:18:54Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk made some big, exciting promises to Tesla investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call Tuesday — but he said they won't start paying off until mid-2026 or later. In the hours after Tesla reported, analysts said they were waiting for two things: a highly anticipated cheaper car and for Tesla's robotaxi to hit the market. Tesla's robotaxi, which was unveiled in October, is a fully autonomous vehicle that could be hailed on a ride-sharing app like a cab. Tesla has also been teasing a cheaper car — without disclosing its model or features — since 2020. Tesla missed expectations for the first quarter, reporting a 71% drop in profits and a 9% drop in revenue. Vehicle sales in particular suffered, with auto revenues down 20% year over year and vehicle deliveries down 13%. The EV maker has faced protests, boycotts, and attacks in recent months over Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Musk announced on the earnings call that he'd be stepping back from DOGE in May, good news to investors who had been concerned that Tesla wasn't getting enough of the billionaire's attention. Tesla stock jumped about 7% after hours, but it is down 41% this year. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts led by Andres Sheppard highlighted the robotaxi and cheaper model in a note following earnings. They added that regulatory approval for full self-driving and robotaxi remains a key risk for Tesla's stock price. A more affordable model could open up Tesla's potential customer base and help the company compete internationally against low-cost Chinese EVs. Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, said, "Tesla has room for significant improvement." "If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly-awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year," he said in a note following the earnings call. Yun Mei, an EV analyst at China Great Wall Securities, emphasized the robotaxi business in an appearance on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She said that she has "strong faith" in Tesla's ability to launch robotaxis because Musk's ownership of xAI gives Tesla a "first mover advantage" in the physical AI space. But she estimated that robotaxis would take around three years to pay off. Tesla has declined offers to pair up with existing ride-hailing platforms like Uber to market its Cybercab business, which could delay its robotaxis becoming mainstream. In a note published on the day the Cybercab was unveiled in October, Jefferies analysts wrote that Tesla may struggle without a partner like Uber or Lyft. Tesla's biggest cheerleader said that these product launches require Musk's focus, which has recently been on DOGE. "This quarter was a disaster," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Tuesday appearance on CNBC after Tesla's earnings. "Everything that's going on here in terms of the opportunities around autonomous, lower cost vehicles, Cybercab, everything else — Musk needs to drive that," he added. Ives was more positive about Musk's decision to spend less time on DOGE. In a research note published after Tesla's analysts call, he hailed the move as a "turning point" for the company. "Musk recommitting as CEO at Tesla and basically leaving his DOGE role over the next month is the biggest and best possible news Tesla investors could have heard last night," Ives wrote, adding that Tesla had got its "biggest asset" back ahead of the crucial robotaxi and affordable EV launches. Musk also set some lofty goals for Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. Tesla is trying to diversify as EV sales have struggled. Slowing EV sales were an issue for Tesla even before Musk's work with DOGE, in part because of increased competition and consumers opting for hybrids over fully electric vehicles. Musk said he expects Tesla to have millions of fully autonomous Teslas on America's streets by the second half of next year. Musk added that Tesla would "start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year" or the second half of next year. The company has often missed target dates in the past, and Musk has previously acknowledged being overly optimistic about timelines. Musk also said Tesla was making good progress on Optimus, its humanoid robot, and it expected to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of the year. He said the company could be producing one million robots a year by 2029 or 2030. Jump to

Title: Elon Musk news: What happens to Tesla stock if index funds stop buying it?

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. I invest in Tesla every month when I make my 401(k) contribution. You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: China Market Update: Hong Kong Climbs Higher

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed despite a stronger U.S. dollar overnight, gold surging, and yesterday’s U.S. equity downdraft, as Taiwan underperformed. The Yen was resilient, giving some validation to today’s Financial Times article on Japanese institutions selling U.S. Treasuries, though it is hard to say for sure. The U.S. dollar’s decline, stock market decline, and asset flow out of the U.S. were topics in Chinese media, though likely being repeated globally. The positions of star active fund managers, revealing their positions, garnered attention on a light economic data and policy day. One manager’s top positions were revealed as Tencent, Alibaba, Kweichow Moutai, Meituan, Wuliangye, Yum China, and CNOOC. Another manager focused solely on Mainland China A shares revealed holdings in Sokon, Eve, Naura, and Trina Solar. After the close, Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the financial arm of China’s sovereign wealth fund, updated its positions in four Mainland equity ETFs with increases of 363 million shares, 501 million shares, 117 million shares, and 157 million shares. The SWF’s positions are in the tens of billions, so the Q1 increases aren’t massive in my opinion. Coincidentally, Reuters published an article on retail investors and the National Team buying during market hours that garnered attention. There continues to be coverage of the government’s rare statements on stabilizing the stock market. Hong Kong’s volumes were strong on a positive day. JD.com was down -6.32% and Meituan was down -4.62%, as they battle for restaurant delivery, which weighed on both stocks as investors fear margin compression. The outcome of these pyrrhic victories has been painful to watch, as firms undercut one another to garner market share, as profitability falls to the wayside. This reminds me of the battle between Uber and Didi. Mainland investors bought a very large net $2.753 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect, as the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, Tencent, and Alibaba were the largest beneficiaries of inflows. 50% of Hong Kong turnover was from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Healthcare was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong, up +6.52%, and Mainland China, up +0.49%, on the belief that the sector will be resilient to the U.S.-China trade war. Mainland technology and growth stocks, including electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and electrical equipment, underperformed. A sell-side economist dropped their 2025 China GDP target to 4% from 4.5%. Hong Kong and Mainland China’s resilience has garnered shockingly little attention from global investors. The CEOs of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target visited President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday. While the companies’ statements called the meeting “productive” and “constructive,” the companies and their customers will unfortunately be adversely impacted by tariffs. Hopefully, the U.S. and China can make some progress, as some have speculated that Nvidia’s Jensen Huang’s visit to Beijing could be his attempt to act as a bridge between the two sides.

Good morning. A new research paper co-authored by Google's David Silver is the talk of the tech industry. It boldly announces a radical new era for AI — it also reads as a "dis" of OpenAI, BI's Alistair Barr writes. In today's big story, Tesla's highly anticipated earnings report comes after the bell. We're breaking down what Wall Street will be watching — and why Tesla really wants the Cybertruck to be a working man's truck. What's on deck Markets: President Trump escalated his feud with the Fed, and investors are nervous. Tech: Internal Microsoft email to managers details new policies aimed at culling low performers. Business: The FTC is arguing that Uber's subscription service is too deceptive in a new suit. But first, bringing the Cybertruck back to earth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The big story Think less DeLorean, more F-150. The Cybertruck is ditching its otherworldly aesthetic to reposition itself as a working man's vehicle, BI's Grace Kay writes. Less than two years after release, Cybertrucks are now piling up in sales lots, fewer than 50,000 vehicles have been delivered, and some owners have become political targets over CEO Elon Musk's association with President Donald Trump. So, what's a car company to do? Enter the quiet rebrand. Tesla sales workers told BI the vehicle needs to appeal to the traditional truck buyer. In mid-April, Tesla redesigned its product page for the first time since the truck's release. Gone are the futuristic aesthetics and allusions to Mars. Now, the vehicle is fit for construction work or a family outing. Tesla is preparing to deliver first-quarter earnings. It faces sluggish delivery numbers, a brand crisis, and a stock price down over 43% this year. It's looking for a boost. Here are a few things that Wall Street will be watching: Impact of Trump tariffs. Tesla's chief financial officer said on the company's last earnings call that, if implemented, tariffs would affect the automaker's business and profitability. He said that while the company had tried to localize its supply chain, it's still "very reliant on parts from across the world" for all its businesses. 1. The "sell America" trade is in full swing. On Monday, stocks, bonds, and the dollar all dropped sharply. This followed Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for taking too long to lower interest rates, which is rattling investor confidence. 2. Politically meddling with the Fed is a bad idea, top official says. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee underscored the importance of the central bank's independence on Monday. He cautioned that political interference could result in hotter inflation and higher unemployment. 3. Companies are cutting earnings outlooks. Trade war uncertainty, interest rate jitters, and recession fears are causing the revisions, which are approaching downside extremes. 1. Inside Amazon's Project Greenland. Last year, Amazon struggled to keep its retail business on track when faced with an AI chip shortage. Its response was Project Greenland: an effort to tightly approve and monitor which projects get GPU access, according to documents obtained by BI. 2. Microsoft is raising the bar. It has created new policies and tools to dial up performance pressure on employees, including a two-year rehire ban for those found to be underperforming, according to an internal email viewed by BI. 3. AI isn't ready to do your job. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University staffed a fake company with AI agents, and the results were disastrous. See the tasks AI failed the most — and where the next development phase is likely headed. 1. Are you stuck with Uber One? You're probably not alone. An FTC lawsuit accuses Uber of overpromising customers how much the paid subscription service will save them, making it too hard to cancel, and, in some cases, signing them up without consent. Uber denies the allegations. 2. Walmart's taking a page from the honeybee playbook. The retail giant is ditching zip codes for a honeycomb-style segmented map in search of speedier grocery delivery. It says the goal is to understand what customers want, where they are, and which stores have what they need. 3. How CEOs are staying calm. As uncertainty swirls over tariffs, many CEOs are turning to their wellness routines to reduce stress. Business leaders shared their tips with BI, from "purposeful scrolling" to finding balance outdoors.

Title: There’s method in King Donald’s ‘madness’ on China

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 8:14:14 PM PDT by cold start Don’t go by the defiant rhetoric, China is hurting and in deep trouble over Trump’s tariffsFor the purpose of writing this column, I had to do some research as I always do. What struck me was how effortlessly China is winning the battle of narratives. It’s all a little confusing. We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

We are apparently in the middle of a trade war, caught in the crossfire as the world’s two largest economies slap each other with tariffs in an escalatory spiral with the Donald Trump administration imposing 145% levies on most Chinese goods this month. That’s more than a little concerning for China, the trade surplus nation that has everything to lose if it is denied access to the American market. Conversely, the United States, the considerably larger and stronger economy that ran a $295.4 billion deficit with China in 2024, is in possession of a whole toolbox of options that it may deploy to increase China’s pain point. That’s economics 101. Countries that enjoy trade surplus, and most certainly China that sends more than $400 billion in goods to the US each year, are vulnerable during trade wars.And yet since the past few weeks western media is chock-full with reports, articles and analyses on China’s ‘impregnable’ economy, its unbeatable resilience, the madness of ‘King Donald’, Xi Jinping’s ‘courage’, ‘moral integrity’ and the fearsome retribution that awaits American economy owing to Trump’s ‘folly’. We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office.

Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We are told that China is ‘winning’, Americans are losing, and tottering Trump’s tariff tantrums have presented Xi with a ‘gift’. Portentous pundits pontificate that this is not a trade war, but American economy’s stunning act of suicide led by a dimwit dolt who occupies the Oval Office. China, not one to let go of opportunity, has mounted a meticulously calibrated narrative attack on American social media networks – that are inaccessible to the Chinese – to spread worry and panic over Trump’s decision, and going by the engagements such posts are getting, it would seem the tactic is succeeding. This piece is essentially about setting the record straight. Make no mistake, China is hurting. Trump’s tariffs, that now stand at a staggering 145%, going up to even 245% on certain goods, present an unprecedented challenge for the exports-dependent Chinese economy that is caught in a deflationary loop, and unless the challenge is mitigated there will be punishing job cuts and very little bandwidth for debt-ridden local governments to bail out the struggling sectors. The one thing China cannot afford to do, however, is blink. The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent.

Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

The Chinese system, led by ‘chairman of everything’ Xi Jinping, is built for stability. It is not meant for adjustments, pliability or conflict. Xi, for all his power, cannot let slip even a hint of weakness. Trump can take unlimited punches, suffer being called a clown, and still stand in the ring. Xi cannot yield even if he’s haemorrhaging. In this piece, I shall strive to explain my position, and elucidate that China’s fire and brimstone rhetoric conceals its deep anxiety and fear underneath. I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs.

Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I posit that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, that have now been paused against every other nation except China, is in essence an attempt at a systemic reset. It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It is, of course, done in a very Trumpian fashion with all the trappings of a reality TV show. That is why despite all available evidence to the contrary of the inherent strength of the American economy, most pundits suffering from ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ are writing off America’s chances in this trade war, and media’s unbalanced coverage is hinging on an axiomatic position that China can do no wrong. Trump, albeit crudely, is trying to decouple American economy from China’s. He understands perhaps intuitively that China has perfected the art of gaming the system of open trade authored by America to such an extent that while China’s export-driven economy achieved uber-efficiency in a matter of decades – trading with 145 countries in 2023, a rise of almost 50% since 2008 – its economy by and large remained inaccessible to the world. Successive American administrations have identified the problem but have been unable to deal with it. China manipulates the WTO-led open trade order, knows how to exploit the loopholes, and has grown immeasurably prosperous by building a sprawling manufacturing base in a relatively short time at the cost of its peer competitors. Trump considers the trajectory deeply unfair and is ready to take drastic steps. To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson To quote researcher Zineb Riboua of Hudson Institute from her blog, “Trump’s trade war is a reconfiguration. His repeated attacks on the World Trade Organization, threats to withdraw, and efforts to bypass multilateral forums all signal a deeper strategy: to reset the rules of global trade in ways that constrain China’s model. For decades, China used the WTO system to scale its export economy while shielding its domestic market. That asymmetric advantage is now being challenged at the foundation.” Look beyond the sweeping tariffs, and you’ll find a conscious attempt to isolate China by striking deals with America’s trading partners. Whether or not the policy will be successful is moot, what we are watching now is the application of the strategy. Some of the trade negotiations the Trump administrations are involved in right now with a bevy of trading partners are aimed at clamping down on transshipment of Chinese goods that are rerouted through third countries to conceal origins, synchronized taxes, or going after Chinese raw materials meant for the American market. The brain behind this step, according to the Wall Street Journal, is US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who apparently pitched the idea to Trump. It involves systematically removing China from the American economy despite the heavy integration and even potentially delisting Chinese stocks from US exchanges to tackle the “the biggest offender in the global trading system”. Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Wall Street Journal reports that US officials “plan to use negotiations with more than 70 nations to ask them to disallow China to ship goods through their countries, prevent Chinese firms from locating in their territories to avoid US tariffs, and not absorb China’s cheap industrial goods into their economies.” The Trump White House reckons that if executed, the moves will considerably weaken China’s hand, dent further its already plagued economy and force Beijing to sit across the table with little leverage. It won’t be easy, of course. UK, for example, has dismissed the idea of cutting trade ties with China despite heavy American pressure. However, if the US succeeds in extracting concessions from even some of them – such as Mexico where Chinese firms have invested billions in hundreds of Mexican factories to make millions of products for the American market tariff-free by taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement – then the noose will tighten around China. Largely due to China’s machinations – its firms exploiting the Mexican loophole – US trade deficit with Mexico shot up to nearly $172 billion in 2024 from about $78 billion in 2018. (Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

(Read the WSJ report here). Or take Vietnam, another favourite destination for Chinese firms to relocate their production. Just like Mexico, that has reportedly offered to match American levies on China to strike a deal with Trump, Vietnam, faced with the prospect of 46% US tariffs, sent a team to Washington and promised to crack down on “trade fraud”, a reference to millions of Chinese goods routed to the US through its territory to avoid American taxes. Chinese tactics range from establishing factories in Vietnam, using Vietnamese workers to process goods for the ‘made in Vietnam’ label, or as Reuters reports, making ships carrying Chinese-made goods dwell in Vietnamese ports “just long enough to obtain documents certifying that the products were made in Vietnam before leaving.” Little wonder that Vietnam now has the fourth-highest trade surplus with the US, next only to China, Mexico and the EU. If these routes are blocked, China would obviously be in deeper trouble. China manufactures far more products than its consumers can absorb, making exports imperative for the wheels of its economy to run. The deflation loop that it suffers from owing to its crisis-ridden real estate sector, where most of the middle-class wealth is parked, is exacerbated by the fact that its export volume far outstrips prices, adding to deflationary pressure. This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is exactly where Trump is stress-testing the Chinese economy by levying eye-watering taxes on exports, attempting to shift the entire global trade architecture from ‘open’ to one based on bilateral ‘deals’ and collective coercive mechanisms. China finds Trump difficult to tackle owing to his unpredictability and refusal to play by the established rules, rules that China has spent decades in manipulating. China also finds it discomfiting that for the leader of a democracy, Trump has a higher threshold of pain and is driven by a sense of manifest destiny. This allows Trump, who has suffered two assassination attempts, to take steps that are seemingly impossible or at least difficult for a leader who functions within the parameters of an electoral democracy. Trump’s uncertainty, unpredictability, greater latitude, and the ability to absorb criticisms pose a particularly tricky challenge for Xi. If the Chinese president retaliates and matches Trump in countermeasures, he risks exposing China’s rickety economy to more external shocks. If Xi appears to back down, that could send a message of ‘weakness’, a fatal quality in a CCP general secretary. That doesn’t mean Xi is sitting idle. It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone.

Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

It has been fascinating to watch the Chinese retaliation, calibrated, targeted and relentless. Cognizant of America’s endeavour to isolate China, Xi has gone on a diplomatic charm offensive. The ‘wolf warrior’ has transformed into an ‘affable’ Xi, trying to win friends and influence people. The Chinese president is wooing the Europeans, trying to wean the bloc away from America’s influence. Xi recently hosted the Spanish president, Pedro Sanchez, and urged the EU to join forces with China to ‘defend globalization’ and resist “unilateral acts of bullying”, a thin reference to Trump’s tariffs. Europeans, anxious with the antics of a mercurial American president whom they do not trust, are in turn gravitating closer to their “systemic rival”, easing regulations on Chinese-made electric vehicles and planning a trip to Beijing in July for a summit meeting with Xi. Self-interest is thicker than ‘values’ and ‘principles’. As Xi’s commerce minister was working the phone lines to parley with European and ASEAN officials, the Chinese president went recently on a Southeast Asia tour, seeking to draw Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam closer to form a broader coalition against Trump’s tariffs. Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down. 🇨🇳 pic.twitter.com/vPgifasYmI — Mao Ning 毛宁 (@SpoxCHN_MaoNing) April 10, 2025 The shrillness can barely conceal the nervousness beneath.

Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Xi’s aim was to portray China as the defender of the global trading system that these nations have benefitted from, and paint China as an image of stability and reliability amid global uncertainty. His task was also to ensure that these Southeast Asian nations do not give in to Trump’s demands of cutting China off from their economies or impose taxes of their own on Chinese goods. China has also sought to present a friendlier face to India. If you tell me that Beijing’s moves to placate New Delhi over a $100 billion trade surplus and promise of buying more “premium products” from Indian manufacturers (that it is yet to act on) has nothing to Trump’s belligerence, then I have a bridge to sell you. Alongside, China has raised duties on American products to 125%, carefully targeting the Red States – blocking natural gas, Boeing jets, beef, poultry and bone meals along with export restrictions on rare earths. These moves are designed to hit specific industries rooted in the MAGA base and exploit America’s dependence on critical minerals needed for modern appliances, medical and defence technology. These elaborate and intricate retaliatory mechanisms adopted by China suggest that Xi is in a precarious spot, waiting for his opponent to blink in a costly game of poker. Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods.

Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Not only does he face an economic crisis that cannot be wished away, he is also struggling with another eventuality – the inevitable fallout of adopting deception as the fulcrum of state policy is that the Chinese Communist Party has made China friendless, and though it runs trade surplus with many nations, it runs trust deficit with everyone. Australia, Japan and South Korea have already rejected his calls of forming a broad coalition against Trump administration, the Southeast Asian nations and the European Union are hedging their bets. On the economic front, despite CCP’s tight control over information, it is difficult to hide the markers of trouble. At the recent Canton trade fair, China’s biggest expo held twice a year in the city of Guangzhou where Chinese manufacturers, all 30,000 of them showcase their products to clients around the globe – a healthy chunk from America – the signs of distress were overwhelming. Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Financial Times spotted a notice by the organisers of the fair, started by Mao Zedong in 1957, describing the current trade scenario as “grim and complex” and warning exhibitors that they would carry out inspections at the end of each of the fair’s three stages to ensure that “none packed up early”. The newspaper quoted many exporters at the fair, saying that that the new levies made selling to the US market unfeasible, with some commenting that “all of our US customers have paused all of their orders… the tariff is too high.” Reuters also spoke to a bunch of exhibitors. Most were too depressed over the proceedings, confirming that American orders “have either been delayed or stopped coming”, a matter of concern for the Chinese economy that’s more exposed to the vulnerabilities of an unstable global commerce than any other nation. Some are looking to close their factories set up in Southeast Asian nations to bypass duties as Trump ratchets up tariffs across the board, while some are laying off employees, reducing management costs and cutting down on sundry expenses. Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Trump’s tariffs, according to another Reuters report, may “slash Chinese exports to the US by 30%, cut overall exports by more than 4.5%, and drag economic growth by 1.3 percentage points.” It will be difficult for Chinese manufacturers, plagued with overcapacity, to cater to new markets of increased competition with the possibility looming large that many nations may raise their own barriers to stop dumping of redirected Chinese goods. One option that Xi in doubling on to escape the punch and clinch on Chinese economy, is spur domestic spending to absorb some of the overcapacity, given that exports to the US may tumble by around 80% over the next two years. The trouble with this plan is that Chinese consumers are unable to spend – as a fall in consumer price index would indicate that declined for a second straight month according to latest data, and producer deflation that recorded a fall for the 29th straight month. Part of the reason Chinese domestic market cannot soak up excess capacity is that its middle-class wealth, tied up in the troubled real estate sector and stock markets is taking a severe beating in a society where “70% of family assets are tied up in property. Every 5% decline in home prices will wipe out 19 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) in housing wealth, according to Bloomberg Economics.” While housing sector’s value may dramatically shrink in China’s GDP, the $2.9 trillion ‘shadow bank’ industry is suffering a collapse, deepening the wealth wipeout. Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

Global banks are slashing China’s growth forecasts with UBS downgrading China’s 2025 growth forecast to 3.4% despite a 5.4% growth in first quarter, while the tariffs have squeezed low-end manufacturers’ wafer-thin margin even tighter. Local governments, lacking in revenue streams, are too impoverished to provide support. FDI flow is at its lowest in three decades, while “confidence in the system among many in China’s elite has been shattered,” reported Bloomberg, quoting an investor who lost 16 million yuan ($2.2 million) from trust products. The report says he’s considering selling his family home in Beijing for a smaller apartment to raise cash. The CCP’s legitimacy is ultimately tied to China’s growth prospects, so the more economic challenges grow, unemployment prospects loom large, the hotter it may get for Xi under the collar with chances growing of internal dissent. Now, put in context the old clip that has resurfaced on American social media networks amplified by China’s foreign ministry, of Mao Zedong declaring that “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.” We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations.

It’s part of a deliberate policy choice that’s fundamental to their strategy for remaining in power. And as such, it puts limits on their ability to respond to a loss of export markets. The Chinese policy of keeping its wealth under the control of the state rather than allowing it to be controlled or shared by the private sector is the basis for the CCP’s tight grip on power. Their control of the government is dependent on an economically dependent populace. Their model for maintaining power is to provide their people with just enough prosperity to keep them compliant, but not enough for them to be in a position to challenge the CCP’s authority. 5 posted on 04/21/2025 10:08:25 PM PDT by mbrfl [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Rockingham One hopes. 6 posted on 04/22/2025 1:14:15 AM PDT by sauropod (Make sure Satan has to climb over a lot of Scripture to get to you.

Title: Tesla’s caught in a trade war trap. Blame Elon Musk

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Like many American manufacturers, Tesla is caught in a bind thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war. Unlike most of those other companies, though, Tesla has an added wrinkle – its CEO, Elon Musk, sometimes called the First Buddy for the close relationship he’s cultivated with the president. On Tuesday, Tesla reports earnings; that afternoon, Musk will take questions from investors. But there is a catch-22: If Musk continues his close ties to Trump, the company could alienate potential customers, both at home and overseas, who dislike Trump’s policies. If he distances himself from Trump, though, he risks the ire of the White House. It’s a lose-lose situation, and it’s a trap of Musk’s own making. The first quarter saw the company’s largest drop in sales after virtually nonstop double-digit sales growth. But the automaker’s finances are only part of what investors will want to know. Reassuring responses on any these topics could help reverse the slide that has wiped out about half of Tesla’s share value (TSLA) since mid-December — and perhaps restore some faith in the company. Dan Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities and longtime Tesla bull who nonetheless recently slashed his price target for Tesla shares, said Musk is facing a “code red situation” if he continues his high profile role in the Trump administration. Blaming brand damage for falling sales, Ives said in a note to clients on Sunday that “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time.” Beyond the Musk backlash, Tesla is also facing growing competition from other EV automakers, especially in China. Bad news on any of these fronts could cause a new downward spiral for the shares. “It’s turned into a nightmare for Tesla and for investors,” Ives told CNN. “The tariffs, the DOGE controversies, the brand damage — it’s been a perfect storm.” In some ways, Tesla is less exposed than other automakers to Trump’s auto tariffs. It does not import cars from its two overseas factories, and it uses fewer foreign parts in its US-built vehicles than other automakers. All other major automakers also have at least some imported vehicles in their American dealerships. It has stopped taking new orders in China for its higher-priced Model S and Model X cars, which are built in California, due to China’s 125% retaliatory tariffs, but those models are only a small fraction of its overall sales. But Musk has said that the cost to Tesla will be “not trivial.” “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” he said on his social media platform, X, the day after Trump’s auto tariff plans were announced. But too much criticism of tariffs during Tuesday’s call could harm his bromance with Trump. Musk became Trump’s largest financial donor last year and has been among his closest advisors since the inauguration. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value in the two months after the election as some investors and analysts hoped Musk would influence Trump to implement Tesla-friendly policies, most notably on self-driving vehicles. Conversely, strong support for Trump’s tariff policies could anger Chinese authorities and EV buyers. China is the world’s largest auto market and EV market, but its consumers are increasingly turning to rivals such as China’s own BYD. Tesla booked $20.9 billion in sales in 2024 in China, about 21% of its revenue, its second-largest market after the United States. Ives called China “the linchpin to the future success of Tesla.” He warned that “the backlash from Trump tariff policies in China and Musk’s association will be hard to understate.” Protests outside Tesla showrooms and vandalism at its facilities underscore the backlash the company and its CEO are facing. Some of the most popular investor questions on Tesla’s site touch on that issue. “Did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate in Q1 relating to all of the rumors of ‘brand damage’?” read one question endorsed by more than 1,000 investors. “How is the company planning to deal with the impact of Elon’s partnership with the current administration?” asked another popular investor question. Another asked: “Boycotts, protests, vandalism, negative headlines, and a stock slide have been sparked by Elon Musk’s participation in changes to U.S. gov’t services & employment. Is the Tesla board discussing whether their CEO should focus fully on Tesla and leave gov’t to elected politicians?” When Musk held an all-hands meeting for Tesla employees last month, it sparked a one-week rally in its battered shares. But the rally proved short-lived. On April 2, when Tesla reported its biggest-ever year-over-year drop in quarterly sales, shares fell sharply — until Politico ran a story later that morning that Musk would soon give up his role in the government. The news lifted shares. However, Musk and other members of the administration said the story wasn’t accurate. “Tesla’s first quarter sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” JPMorgan Chase analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about its sales or the impact that Musk’s role in the administration had on those sales. Musk has made ambitious promises for a fleet of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots, claiming that they will make the company the most valuable in the world. He had touted plans for a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, due to start in June. But there have been no updates. Meanwhile, Uber and Google’s own driverless car unit, Waymo, has beaten Tesla to the punch with the start of its own joint driverless taxi service in that city. “It would be a huge negative for the stock if he pushed back (the robotaxi plans),” Ives said. “We need to hear good news there, because there’s not going to be good news in terms of earnings or what the rest of the year will look like financially.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
