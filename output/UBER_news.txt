Title: Are You Ready for Agentic AI Shoppers as Customers?
URL: https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/are-you-ready-for-agentic-ai-shoppers-as-customers/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T20:20:02Z
Full Content:
CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Payments get smarter. Agentic AI allows bots to make purchases securely with tokenized payments. This helps shift trust and control dynamics in ecommerce. Search gets rewritten. Brands must optimize product data for AI agents as discovery shifts from SEO to intent-driven automation. CX gets invisible. Agentic AI compresses the entire buying journey into a seamless background process. As much as agentic AI promises to make our lives easier, delegating tasks and errands is certainly not new. Even in our mobile-first, app-based reality, you can use Instacart for your groceries, Stitch Fix for your wardrobe, Uber to get driven to your next destination and countless other apps to get other people to help you get things done. Yet all of those things still involve people to fulfill your requests. Shopping, planning and nearly everything else are gaining a whole new level of automation. This comes from deeper integration and the introduction of agentic AI into even the most complex and security-critical tasks we perform. The recent developments in the payments space illustrate this well. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have recently introduced agentic AI functionality so that software agents can swipe a “card” as easily as a human thumb‑printing a phone. For retail brands, the clock is ticking. Whoever serves these bots first will capture the carts they fill on behalf of their human customers. Let’s look at three ways that agentic AI is going to transform the ecommerce buying experience. First, let's discuss the biggest change that agentic AI payments introduce from a customer perspective. That’s handing over your payment information to an AI agent. Technologies such as Visa’s Intelligent Commerce and Mastercard’s Agent Pay create 16‑digit network tokens (think prepaid cards with parental controls) that an AI agent uses across the web without exposing details like credit card numbers or other PII. While some shoppers may bristle at this idea, it can be a win-win from a convenience and security standpoint. Consumers can cap a bot’s weekly “allowance,” whether that’s total spend or on a specific list of items such as groceries. Shoppers can also review an audit trail that shows every purchase the software made. Peace of mind replaces the low‑grade anxiety that has long haunted card‑on‑file commerce that doesn’t have the same types of protections. What does this mean for retailers? This shift calls for several key implementations to support a seamless process. Checkout flows must be updated to accommodate the new token format and to surface agent-level permissions such as spend ceilings and stock keeping unit (SKU) categories. Creating data loops is also essential; receipt data should be fed back instantly so agents can reconcile budgets without guesswork. At the same time, fraud strategies need to be rethought. While chargeback risks may decrease, the intolerance for even a single false decline will rise. While this may feel like a big shift for consumers, there have been small steps toward this already. Whether it’s digital wallets, saved payment sources or delegating shopping needs to less automated apps and processes, the next logical step is to allow agentic payments. Increased transparency and control make this even more compelling. The next aspect is one that is fundamentally changing the way that brands are reaching their potential and current customers. While search engine optimization has played a key role in driving awareness and even repeat purchases, the rapid growth of AI-generated search results within platforms like Perplexity, ChatGPT and even Google are changing the way customers discover products and services. With the introduction of agentic AI and AI-based shoppers, the marketing funnel will shift from a predominantly human, keyword‑based search to include a greater focus on agent intent optimization (AIO), which means feeding AI-based integrations the richest possible product attributes so they can satisfy a shopper’s request (i.e., “vegan leather sneakers, size 9, under $120, carbon‑neutral shipping”). How autonomous AI is redefining the buying journey from discovery to post-purchase. The buyer’s journey will be forever changed by this change. While people shopping for themselves will likely never go away completely, the idea that a consumer could brief a bot once and outsource time-consuming searching, browsing and shopping behaviors, particularly for the more mundane items on their list, will win many shoppers over quickly. For brands, this means that having their products show at the top of a Google search isn’t quite the prize it used to be. Instead, they need their SKU on bots’ short lists to remain relevant. Retailers will need to take steps here to make sure they are as agent-optimized as they are currently search-optimized. This includes investing in product‑information hygiene by creating exhaustive attributes, standardized taxonomy and plain‑language “why buy” notes an agent can quote back to a shopper. They’ll also need to expose their inventory and price APIs to make sure that recommendations incorporating their products stay current. Lastly, brands should focus on the details by tagging sustainability, warranty and fit‑and‑feel data, as many agents will rank based on sustainability or the likelihood of returns. Related Article: Is AI Your New Shopping Buddy? Because of its highly autonomous nature, agentic commerce collapses discovery, comparison, payment and even returns into a single behind‑the‑scenes flow while the consumer is able to sit back and do something else. In this scenario, consumers will come to value time over price in many cases. While some decisions may always be most influenced by price, when consumers are able to benefit from time savings and convenience, their loyalty is likely to shift to whichever merchant makes their agent’s work the easiest. Brands accustomed to the current set of security and risk mitigation standards will quickly be introduced to a whole new set of protocols. For instance, payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are insisting on a trust fabric that verifies agents, explains decisions and supports real‑time cancellation. This is critical in a fast-paced environment. Retailers will need to rethink some of what they currently have in place and approach it with an agentic mindset. This includes publishing post‑purchase status hooks such as shipping updates, estimated arrival times and exchange labels that agents can poll without scraping customer email confirmations. Policies also need to be machine readable. Everything that typically appears in the fine print, including refund windows, warranty terms and sustainability scores, must now be agent-friendly so the agent can justify its choices and make sure decisions align with the human buyer's requirements. Transparent recourse paths are also essential. That means building dispute APIs and providing clear human override options to build the transparency that agents need to recommend your brand over countless others. Related Article: AI Transparency and Ethics: Building Customer Trust in AI Systems Steps brands should take now to accommodate autonomous AI shoppers. With all of these potential opportunities and challenges introduced with agentic AI in e-commerce, there are many potential starting points. Let’s look at a few things that retailers can do in the months ahead to prepare. Start by getting your platform ready. Determine if your current checkout platform can already accept network-issued agent tokens. If it can’t, consider what it would take to make that happen. Next, get your products ready. Audit your product catalog to understand every attribute a human shopper can quickly identify. This will help clarify how AI agents will interpret your catalog. Plan ahead to smooth the journey for both agents and customers. Map the post-purchase path to identify where an agent might get stuck today and how those blockers could be removed. Finally, stay one step ahead of potential risks. Stay current on compliance and best practices, as this is a fast-moving space. The payments industry may be subject to shifting regulations and security best practices, and providers such as Visa and Mastercard are expected to formalize trust protocols soon. Retailers that take the next step to adopt agentic AI to complete purchases while reducing or eliminating friction within the process will emerge as winners in the next race to improve the buyer’s journey. Brands that hesitate may discover that future shopping carts are filled long before they even realize a bot has already walked through the (virtual) door.

Title: China Market Update: Baidu, Full Truck & XPeng Q1 Earnings Results Reviewed

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Baidu Search giant Baidu (9888 HK, BIDU), which has artificial intelligence ambitions, released its Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close. Full Truck Alliance Full Truck Alliance (YMM US), a digital freight platform/Uber for truck drivers, reported Q1 results after the Hong Kong close. I hope management speaks to a Hong Kong secondary listing to mitigate a policy error surrounding U.S.-listed China ADRs. Xpeng Electric Vehicle maker XPeng (9868 HK, XPEV US) released Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close today. Asian equities were broadly higher overnight, led by gains in Taiwan, while Japan and Thailand underperformed as a CNN report on an Israeli strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities drew global attention. Energy stocks rose in response to the news, alongside gains in precious metals and coal in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Value stocks in Mainland China outperformed growth stocks, while Hong Kong growth stocks rebounded, seemingly dismissing concerns raised by the recent Financial Times article, “Top US state Republicans urge SEC to consider delisting Chinese companies.” The Financial Times article referenced a letter from 21 U.S. state Republican financial officers, which contained several inaccuracies and misstatements. Notably, the Financial Times did acknowledge that Chinese companies had received a clean bill of health from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In meetings with several global financial institutions in Hong Kong, local sentiment was clear: the few remaining U.S.-listed Chinese companies without a Hong Kong listing are expected to re-list in the city. The timing of the letter coincided with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited’s (CATL) Hong Kong initial public offering—the world’s largest so far this year—which, in previous years, would likely have taken place in New York. As a result, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Limited (HKeX) rose 3.27%. CATL shares advanced another 10.19% in Hong Kong, with BYD Company Limited up 4.05%, Li Auto Inc. up 4.05%, and Geely Automobile Holdings Limited up 3.09%. Internet stocks also performed well, as Alibaba Group Holding Limited gained 1.15% after announcing a partnership with Meitu Inc., a provider of photo-editing and beautification applications with strong connections in the cosmetics industry. Meitu’s shares surged 18.98% on the news. The healthcare sector maintained positive momentum in both markets following yesterday’s licensing agreement between 3SBio Inc. and Pfizer Inc. Mainland investors purchased $182 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks via the Southbound Stock Connect. In policy news, eight Chinese government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), announced “Several Measures to Support the Financing of Small and Micro Enterprises.” Small businesses account for the majority of employment in Mainland China, and these measures are intended to ease access to loans and reduce financing costs. A Mainland media source reported the completion of the third version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone agreement, though details remain limited. Despite yesterday’s Loan Prime Rate (LPR) cut, Mainland China equities did not see stronger gains, highlighting that restoring consumer confidence will take time. On a positive note, April tax revenue increased for the first time this year, signaling a tentative economic rebound. The 618 E-Commerce event, initiated by JD.com and now adopted by other platforms, is starting earlier than usual this year. While the event may boost top-line revenue growth, the associated discounts could weigh on margins and net income. Earnings per share (EPS) should benefit from continued share buybacks.

Industrials were one of the biggest losers of the Liberation Day stock market sell-off, but they've since made an impressive comeback. The sector hit record highs at the start of the week after plunging over 20% in April. Since 1990, only two other periods have seen this level of price appreciation: immediately after the Great Financial Crisis and the pandemic. Industrials are one of the most tariff-exposed areas of the economy. Companies in the sector often rely heavily on global trade and have thin margins that can be easily disturbed by import and export costs. The sector includes companies like GE Aerospace, Boeing, and Uber Technologies. Increased confidence in the economy and trade negotiations, combined with strong performances from aerospace and defense stocks, helped carry the rally. Trump's recent announcement of a $175 billion investment into the Golden Dome missile defense system is also looking like a promising tailwind for the sector. Industrials is the first sector to break record highs after Liberation Day. Institutional investors are buying into the rally, adding more fuel. According to Bank of America, for the week ending May 16, hedge fund net purchases of industrial stocks were at their highest level since 2008. Additionally, 65% of the sector's stocks are trading above their 200-day moving averages, indicating that more stocks are participating in the rally, according to Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. While "sector breadth has notably improved," it's still lower than what it was during previous record highs, Turnquist points out. When the sector was previously trading at all-time highs in late 2024, 80 to 90% of stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average. The percentage of stocks in the sector hitting 52-week highs is also still low, at just shy of 9% this week. LPL Financial remains neutral on the sector, but Turnquist acknowledges that the technical setup is constructive for a continuing rally — and could point to cyclical stocks becoming leaders in the overall stock market recovery.

Title: Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure

A $1.2 billion exchangeable bond deal announced last week by Uber Technologies reportedly features a rare structure that is appealing to investors and to Uber. The deal is tied to Uber’s shares in self-driving truck firm Aurora Innovation and includes bonds that turn into equity if the stock exceeds a set price after a set period, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20). The deal allows investors to participate in the upside of Aurora’s business while limiting the downside, as they could end up with a valuable stake if the price of the shares rises above the conversion threshold, while they can get paid back the par value of the bond at maturity if the stock drops, according to the report. For Uber, the deal provided favorable terms that included zero coupon and a conversion premium above the marketed range, the report said. Uber retains some upside and can defer tax on the gains. Only about 6% of total U.S. convertible debt over the past five years has had an exchangeable bond structure, but that share may increase among companies with solid credit and adequate stakes in other companies, the report said. Uber announced its plans for a private placement of exchangeable senior notes in a May 13 press release. It announced the pricing of the offering in another press release on the same day. “Uber intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include strategic investments, although Uber has not designated any specific uses at this time,” the company said in the first release. Aurora is developing self-driving systems for commercial vehicles like trucks and plans to deploy driverless trucks at scale. When announcing the company’s first quarter results on May 8, Aurora Innovation Co-Founder and CEO Chris Urmson noted that its self-driving trucks are now hauling commercial freight on Texas roads. “We are the first company to operate commercial driverless heavy-duty trucks on public roads,” Urmson said in a press release. “From here we’ll focus on proving the promise of the technology, increasing the value of our product for customers and ultimately becoming an essential partner in the freight industry.” This Week in AI: The Agentic Web, AI-Native Devices and Search Tools Trump Threatens to Raise Tariffs on Apple and European Union The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Report: SBA Staffing Cuts Reduce Service to Entrepreneurs We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: The Travel Stocks Congress Loves to Trade

Photo Credit: Dozen of lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies. Wikimedia Commons / David Maiolo More than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies — even as they oversee and regulate them. Members of Congress help shape the future of the travel industry — and some are personally investing in it, too. A Skift analysis of congressional financial disclosures reveals that more than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in airlines, hotel chains, cruise companies, and travel tech firms. In all, federal lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 individual travel industry-related stock trades since the 2021-2022 congressional session, congressional financial records indicate. Taken together, the purchases and sales are worth well into the millions of dollars. Shares of Marriott International, Airbnb, Uber, Hilton Worldwide, and Booking Holdings rank among the most frequently traded common stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Members of Congress are legally allowed to buy and sell individual stocks as long as they don’t violate the anti-insider trading provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act. They must disclose their trades within 45 days. Dozens of members of Congress have violated these disclosure rules in the past decade. And a growing number of elected Republicans and Democrats alike want to limit or ban trading individual stocks. Even some of Congress’ most prolific travel stock traders tell Skift that they’re rethinking their investment strategies or have recently stopped trading individual stocks. “The travel and tourism industry is affected by tax implications, subsidies, lots of decisions,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. “Lawmakers can pass a stock ban … they could just invest in broad-based mutual funds right now.” Here is Skift’s company-by-company assessment of which federal lawmakers are trading travel and tourism industry stocks: In all, eight members of Congress disclosed making recent Booking Holdings stock trades within their immediate families, including Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Reps. Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.), Bill Keating (D-Mass.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas). A Skift analysis reveals that more than three dozen U.S. lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 stock trades in travel industry companies since 2021, including airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and travel tech firms. The most frequently traded stocks include Booking Holdings, Marriott, Airbnb, Hilton, Uber, and Boeing. While members are legally permitted to trade stocks if they follow disclosure rules under the STOCK Act, many have violated these requirements, fueling bipartisan efforts to ban or further restrict individual stock trading by members of Congress. Lawmakers often cite the use of third-party managers or blind trusts to avoid conflicts of interest, but the practice continues to raise ethical concerns.

May 19, 2025 16:11 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares announced today that it will close and liquidate the following ETF: On May 09, 2025, the board of GraniteShares ETF Trust approved the liquidation of the GraniteShares 1x Short AMD Daily ETF (the “ETF”). The last day of trading for the ETF on NASDAQ Stock Market will be June 20, 2025. The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 18, 2025. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 20, 2025. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 20, 2025, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 23, 2025. When the ETF commences the liquidation of its portfolio, it may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the ETF’s investment objectives and strategies. At the time the liquidation of the ETF is complete, the ETF shares will be individually redeemed. For shareholders that still hold shares of the ETF as of June 20, 2025, shares will be automatically redeemed for cash at the net asset value as of close of business on that date, which will reflect the costs of closing the ETF. Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss on the redemptions. The ETF may or may not pay one or more dividends or other distributions prior to or along with the redemption payments. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares will continue to offer the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: Contact Information:William Rhind, CEO GraniteShares Inc +1 646 876 5049 william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2025/05/19/hired-hand-billionaires-2025-these-48-executives-got-rich-working-for-others/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T10:30:00Z

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that’s increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That’s helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America’s 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country’s richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year’s list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton “Tony” James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America’s three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren’t just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America’s nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year’s group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump’s secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year’s list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year’s ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year’s hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin’s stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump’s future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank’s shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant’s billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm’s other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG’s stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company’s stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher’s stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn’t go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm’s cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company’s struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It’s now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm’s stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he’s netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm’s European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone’s stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant’s chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America’s richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft’s billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft’s own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company’s stock, but that’s just enough to make him a billionaire—when combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years

It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out.

Title: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’ Review: Benicio Del Toro Hilariously Dominates Wes Anderson’s Latest All-Star Wes Anderson Movie – Cannes Film Festival

By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. An auteur in the truest sense of the word, he is as much a painter with words and visuals that put us unquestionably into part of a brain that sees the world the way he wants to see it. There’s his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‘s Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Sure, there are the usual starry cameos running through the story, but it is all in the service of Zsa-zsa, a man who dominated the business world and global economy in Europe in the early 1950s in much the same way we see Elon Musk now, an equally shady rich guy whose track record is spotty at best. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits — you name it, he’s done it. But is it all bad? Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’s Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera & Mia Threapleton On Wes Anderson’s Comedic Timing – Cannes Studio Zsa-zsa, who has survived six airplane crashes including the latest one that opens the film on a note of excitement, is even starting to see God, or at least a group of religious leaders who act as therapists in a way in fantasy sequences where he thinks he has died. Somehow he never does, even with a price on his head by any number of would-be assassins. His latest plan, with the lofty name of the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme, has him enlisting his 20-year-old daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), who is in training to become a nun but whom he thinks could be better suited to ultimately take over his company and complicated financial dealings. Why not his nine — count ’em — nine sons (another Musk comparison)? He wants to give Liesl a shot. The idea is to create an infrastructure scheme for an unused area of Earth that can be mined for a potentially rich region that doesn’t exist yet. In return, his business takes in 5% of the newfound riches in perpetuity. To do this he also has to enlist a number of wealthy donors from the worlds of shipping, mining, railroad, banking, real estate and the black market. Their identities all are contained in a set of shoeboxes, each with a particular specialty. RELATED: Cannes Film Festival 2025: Read All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews First up is a visit to Prince Farouk (Riz Ahmed), who has proven savvy with his kingdom’s natural wealth, then to an underground tunnel for a meeting with railroad barons Leland (Tom Hanks) and Reagan (Bryan Cranston). Another box introduces us to Marseilles Bob (Mathieu Amalric), a gangster and nightclub owner who wants terrorists to stop shooting up his place. There alsois the shipping magnate (Jeffrey Wright) who could be crucial; a second cousin named Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, in briefly) who could be new wife material; and finally leading up to his brother, the conniving Uncle Nubar (a very amusing Benedict Cumberbatch), who is big trouble in the family. With Liesl just as interested in trying to solve her mother’s murder (could it be Nubar?) as in closing the gap of Zsa-zsa’s vast finances, they are on dueling paths, joined by the other major character to complete this triangle, that of Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera), who also studies insects. Of course he does! As Anderson explains the mindset of Zsa-zsa, “he is a certain type of businessman who can always pivot. He has no obligation to the truth.” The director cites all sorts of real-life figures from the past as inspirations for this man, people only a Jeopardy! contestant might be able to reel off instantly, but you can certainly see the Trump/Musk influence creeping in, even though this was written long before their partnership got into the picture. At least that is what I sniff here, proving Anderson’s wholly fictional creation has some odd relation to our current reality. Can you imagine Zsa-zsa living in these times? RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery As with all Anderson films, the production values are spectacular. This one was shot almost exclusively on soundstages at Studio Babelsberg in Germany. Bruno Delbonnel’s lush cinematography (first time working on a feature with Anderson, who usually goes back to the same well of artisans) and Adam Stockhausen’s production design are exquisite as are Milena Canonero’s costumes and Alexandre Desplat’s score. The film belongs lock, stock and barrel to Del Toro, playing this Onassis-style billionaire who proves again to be so adept to the rhythms of Anderson’s dialogue and delivers flawlessly here. So do newcomer Threapleton as Liesl and Cera, a first-timer in Anderson’s stock company who undoubtedly will be asked back. Ahmed and Cumberbatch also are welcome additions, as is regular Richard Ayoade as a terrorist leader. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as pop-ups along the way, with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day’s work. Anderson, Jeremy Dawson, John Peet and Steven Rales are producers.
