As such, you probably also need something in which you can haul that gear, both to keep it all organized and safe in your travels. In that case, you’re going to want a work bag to make that commute with you day-in and day-out. And while there’s not a single bag that works for everyone, there are a number of options that are handsome and tough enough to survive the daily grind of all styles — be they a backpack, messenger bag, briefcase, or otherwise. We’ve gone through the trouble of testing our favorites in this guide to the best work bags for men. Whatever your work life, there’s something here for you.

BackpacksHonorable MentionsTested: The Best Work Backpacks to Carry Daily Article Overview With work bags coming in the form of briefcases, backpacks, and messenger bags, it can sometimes be a bit intimidating knowing what to look for when shopping. Fortunately, regardless as to which style of bag, all three carry solutions share a host of traits and properties that should be taken into account. For our guide, we wanted to represent the three major categories of work bags while also paying attention to usage and purpose (e.g., cycling, gym-to-office, white collar settings). We looked at some of our favorite bag brands and some up-and-comers, paying attention to capacity, construction, materials, aesthetic, laptop sleeve and storage, and price. Once we sourced our units for testing, we spent considerable amounts of hands-on time with each briefcase, messenger bag, and backpack, whittling the list down to a select few that really stood out. We really focused on the practicality of using each bag and how it looked and felt doing so. Our results are detailed below. Primary Construction: The material used to construct a work bag’s shell is of monumental importance, as this one single factor plays an enormous role in determining a bag’s overall quality and durability — making this an absolutely essential area to review when shopping. Modern work bags feature shells that are cut from a wide variety of constructions ranging from old-school leather and canvas models to more contemporary bags crafted from CORDURA, sailcloth, or other modern materials. Secondary Materials: Though admittedly not as important as a bag’s shell material, you’ll still want too explore secondary constructions as these also play a major role in a bag’s overall quality and user experience. Secondary materials to review include a bag’s liner material, back pad, shoulder or crossbody straps, and any other grab handles or attachment points. Hardware: One area that separates the more premium bags on the market from their cheaper counterparts is the hardware that they employ. As such, when shopping for a work bag, you’ll want to review the types of zippers being used, as well as any present buckles or other hardware. Build Quality & Craftsmanship: It’s not just a bag’s material selection that plays a role in its overall quality, but also how those materials have been pieced together that matter. As such, you’ll want to review the construction technique or techniques used to make a bag. What’s more, it’s also worth exploring the brand behind each bag, as smaller more boutique outfits almost always exhibit much better craftsmanship compared to companies mass-producing their bags. Size & Volume: A work bag’s size and volume is also of major importance, as this will directly determine how much gear it can carry, as well as other factors such as weight. We recommend considering the supplies, tech, and other essentials that you plan on regularly commuting with, as this should help you determine what size bag you’ll need in order to comfortable accommodate all of your daily kit. Tech Storage: Technology and devices continue to increasingly permeate almost every aspect of our lives — making tech storage an area of monumental importance to consider when shopping. When reviewing this factor, you’ll want to look into whether or not a bag has a laptop sleeve, and if it does, what size it is, if it’s padded, and if it’s suspended or equipped with a false bottom. We also recommend looking out for organizational features for housing cables, cords, wireless mice, chargers, and other tech peripherals. There are also some bags on the market that feature storage for a laptop and a supplementary tablet — or a second notebook. Organizational Amenities: Alongside storage for tech, modern work bags usually feature a wealth of additional organizational amenities geared towards modern workers, such as pen slips, compartments for files and documents, key fob leashes, and water bottle pockets. Style: Whether you fancy an unmistakably vintage-inspired bag or have more of a proclivity for modern models, the huge diversity of options on the market practically ensure that there will be a work bag out there that will personally resonate with you — making style another crucial area to consider when shopping. Best Minimalist Bag: The messenger bag, especially more modernized and up-to-date versions, are one of the best bag styles for modern men who are frequently on-the-go. And Timbuk2’s Commute 2.0 is an especially hard-working bag that goes perfectly with a lifestyle marked by hustle and bustle. It holds up to 19L of gear, weighs just 2.8 pounds, fits up to a 15″ laptop, has a water-resistant exterior, and has plenty of internal and external pouches and compartments for all your storage needs — including a water bottle pocket. Best of all, this bag is backed by Timbuk2’s lifetime warranty. In a world where bags are getting increasingly more nuanced, there’s still room for simplicity. While the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 isn’t barebones, it’s certainly straightforward, with basic pocket structure, including two large primary pockets, the front-most having smaller compartments for organizing. However, don’t expect this to be super specialized. On the other hand, the exterior has its fair share of zippered pockets if you do happen to bring along some smaller gear. This includes two underneath the folding lid, which also has two Velcro straps for carrying something like an umbrella or tripod. On the shoulder, the Commute wears very comfortably with its padded strap, while the attachable stabilizer strap might help when cycling, or for days when you’ve simply brought along more than you can handle. I appreciated the webbed lid, which helped keep out the light drizzles I was experiencing during testing. Likewise, the buckles came on and off very easily, but never too easily. At well under $200, the messenger bag is a perfect option for those on a budget, perhaps college students working a summer internship. However, this is definitely a solid pick even if you don’t want all the bells and whistles of a more technical bag. My biggest complaint with the Commute 2.0 is the small size of the water bottle compartment. I carry a larger 32-ounce thermos but it wasn’t fitting inside this pouch. Also, even though it wasn’t our experience during testing, the laptop compartment, while sturdy enough, isn’t suspended at the bottom, which might be an issue if you set this down too hard. However, the bottom of the bag is luckily reinforced very well so that this might not be an issue at all. Verdict: While not the most robust bag in the world, the Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 is still plenty sturdy with its reinforced bottom and water-resistant shell. We loved the straightforward design that doesn’t give you too much, albeit still presenting plenty of pocket options. The water bottle compartment is a bit too small and the laptop sleeve makes us a bit nervous but we didn’t run into any problems in the field. For just $170 or less, this messenger bag will be the perfect choice for lots of buyers. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: Recycled Nylon Volume: 19L Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best For Cyclists: Chrome Industries first released its game-changing Citizen Messenger Bag back in 1995, and though nearly three decades have passed since that time, the Citizen remains one of the best messenger bags — and best choice for cyclists — on the market. Cut from 1,050-denier nylon — or laminated sailcloth — Chrome Industries’ Citizen Messenger Bag is a 24-liter vessel that features a fully waterproof floating TPE bucket liner that includes separate wet and dry compartments, while also featuring reflective detailing which is great for night riding. Inside, the bag also features a laptop sleeve capable of storing 15” notebooks, while the outside features a crossbody strap equipped with one of Chrome’s signature seatbelt-style quick-release buckles — the latter of which bolsters the bag’s style and character as well as functionality. Recognizing that not every work bag has to be tailored towards the office worker, the Citizen Messenger Bag is a deceptively spacious messenger bag that’s cleverly designed. While bottle sleeves are typically held on the outside of bags, I particularly love the interior side pockets for both a water bottle and umbrella. As for the dedicated laptop sleeve, it won’t look or feel as secure as the ones on your typical laptop bags but it’s certainly more weatherproof. First, you benefit from the sailcloth exterior, then the top of this hidden compartment is sealed with ultra-strong Velcro. Chrome still leaves room on the outside for your pens and pencils with dedicated compartments. Also, if you’re traveling a long distance with the Citizen bag, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s very comfortable around the shoulder and neck area. As I mentioned, the laptop sleeve here isn’t necessarily as great as some others. It’s very unstructured and isn’t padded. However, I opted to bring my own separate sleeve and put that in the dedicated compartment instead, still benefiting from the weatherproofing built in. Also, the main compartment is very large. This thing maxes out at 28L, which can be great if you’re the type of person who wants a catch-all for all your day’s gear. After all, if you’re biking to and from work, there’s a good chance you’ll want to stock up with everything you’ll need throughout the day; this thing can easily double as a work-to-gym bag as well. However, this will be too big for many users. Lastly, while the buckles are highly sturdy, they can be a bit tough to open when you’re in a hurry, especially one-handed –– but at least it closes quickly, which is unarguably more important. Verdict: Large and in charge, the Citizen Messenger Bag from Chrome was a game-changer when it came out in the ’90s and is still just as inventive today. We loved the thoughtful features like the interior bottle compartments and the heavy-duty Velcro to supplement the weatherproof sailcloth shell. While 28L may be a bit much for many workers, this cycling bag will more than carry your day’s worth of work gear, and then some, and is very comfortable to wear on longer journeys. If you’re looking for a laptop messenger bag, you may want to try something else but this is nevertheless a fantastic, fairly priced option for urban commuters. Type: Messenger bag Primary Construction: 1,050D Nylon (or Laminated Sailcloth) Volume: 24L (or 28L) Weight: 2.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Gym-To-Office Bag: Not everyone is going to need a convertible bag that can haul up to 21.4L worth of gear. But for those who do, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Aer Duffel Pack 3. Not only is this minimalist third-gen bag beautifully-designed, but it’s got an exterior crafted from insanely-rugged water-resistant 1,680-denier CORDURA ballistic nylon, a huge variety of organizational compartments — including a ventilated shoe compartment if you need to swap your commuter sneakers for a nice pair of dress shoes — heavy-duty hardware, a 16-inch laptop pouch, and so much more. Add to that Aer’s signature brand of sleek minimalist aesthetics, and you’ve got one of the best work backpacks that money can buy. And when you’re not using it for work, this bag makes an absolutely superb travel pack or gym bag, as well. You wouldn’t be wrong to feel like this backpack-meets-duffel bag from Aer is your favorite of the bunch, whether or not you’re actually going into the office. The real selling point of the Duffel Pack 3 is its versatility. Of any bag here, this one is the most favorable for transitioning to weekend outings or traveling. Like all of Aer’s backpacks, the shoulder straps here are very comfortable, especially throughout a long day, and with lots of gear in this 21.4-liter bag. Multiple grab handles helps with its carry-on status, as well as attaching to another bag perhaps, or vice versa. Seemingly every place that could potentially house a compartment does house a compartment, and without adding bulk. For instance, there’s a sort of pleated design on the front of the bag, which gives the bag its stylish design language but also adds two large but tight water bottle pockets (one on either side), as well as small, hidden zippered pockets up top. There’s also a zippered pocket in the top of the bag, as well as a drainable shoe pouch at the bottom. Also, the main laptop compartment is a star on its own, with tons of room for extra cables, chargers, and stationary, etc. And the laptop sleeve is suspended, helping it remain protected from drops and the like. My favorite element is the large compartment in front, which features water-resistant zippers that are easy to open. And when I say, “zippers,” I’m referring to two of them. This is ever helpful when it is actually raining and you need to access the interior. When there’s only one zipper, you run the risk of having to open the entire bag if the item you’re looking for is on the other side. Two zippers, however, minimizes water ingress. Also, this compartment has a flex pouch on the inside. But the clever part is that Aer uses the flap that hangs down from the top exterior pocket twofold, allowing it to double as extra coverage over the opening of the flex pocket, bolstering the water-resistance even further. Admittedly, there’s not much to complain about with the Aer Duffel Pack 3. It’s my favorite bag on this list, and not just because I’m partial to backpacks. The price point is also perfect, comfortably under $200. I would, however, love if there were a way to remove the backpack straps and easily add a more traditional duffel strap to the front. On the other hand, this might affect the visual appeal of the Duffel Pack while also eliminating its versatility. Also, as much as I loved the shoe compartment for my low-top shoes (size 12.5), it didn’t fit my high-tops, which I use for playing basketball at the gym. Verdict: Arguably the coolest and most unique bag on this list, the Aer Duffel Pack 3 is a fairly priced backpack that makes complete use of every square inch without adding any bulk. The pockets and compartments are so thoughtfully designed but aren’t too complicated. Large water bottle pockets, a dedicated shoe compartment, and a water-resistant duffel compartment are just bonuses to the well-structured and suspended laptop pocket. Whether you’re going from office-to-gym, traveling for the weekend, or just going about your day with some gear on your back, this is a fantastic choice. Type: Backpack with duffel features Primary Construction: 1,680D CORDURA Volume: 21.4L Weight: 2.9LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Rugged Briefcase: While Filson is best known for their rugged, heritage-focused gear with a focus on the outdoors, their refined design language unsurprisingly has also paired beautifully into a range of office-friendly gear, as well. Eschewing the standard work bag “look,” their Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is built with British Millerain’s famed waxed cotton, woven tightly by Filson for abrasion resistance. However, it’s outfitted with a padded 15-inch laptop sleeve, bridle leather handles, and removable shoulder strap for better office friendliness. There’s also a large front stow pocket for papers and folders, a durable YKK zipper, and 9L of space. Filson has several briefcase options that are all worthy of contention. We also liked the Dryden, which is unfortunately no longer available. However, the versatility and ruggedness of this heritage-inspired Tin Cloth bag made it a great choice as well. If you’re looking for a simple, non-cumbersome way to transport your laptop and a few extras into work, then the Filson Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase will be a nice pick. It only holds 9L but that should be perfectly fine for many workers. Also, if you’ve ever owned a Filson bag, you’ll know what to expect in terms of style. The Tin Cloth has a beautifully rugged aesthetic that might not necessarily fit the office milieu in some instances, but can be the perfect outlet for expression in others. As for the laptop compartment, some users will notice that it’s not necessarily as sturdy as some others on this list. However, Filson does give it slight supsension to prevent your laptop from just resting at the bottom of the bag. The briefcase also has quite a wide bottom that actually allows it to stand up on its own with its EVA foam bottom, even with stuff inside. However, I have a MacBook Air, which is very lightweight; I can’t speak to this effect with a heavier laptop. I also appreciated how the Tin Cloth briefcase didn’t smell like waxed cotton canvas can often smell like, especially when it’s been treated with oil like this one has. As I said, the rugged design won’t be for everyone, but this is hardly a point of contention since the bag at no point hides its primary aesthetic. In terms of actual critiques, my main quibbles are with the carrying options. The detachable shoulder strap isn’t necessarily the most comfortable, and could certainly use some sort of padding for the neck area. However, it’s not offensively uncomfortable either, especially considering this briefcase doesn’t hold that much gear. Likewise, the leather handles could also use some sort of padding. I found my hands getting fatigued after just 20 minutes of carrying this. I should also mention that the price here will feel a bit steep for many buyers wondering why a small, simple, 9-liter briefcase costs over $350. While this is to be expected from a heritage brand like Filson and can be justified with their construction methods and durability, I see how it can turn some people off. Verdict: As rugged as you’d expect from Filson, the Tin Cloth Compact Briefcase is a simple, small, and durable briefcase that can effectively carry your laptop without many issues; the laptop sleeve is even suspended and the bag can stand up on its own in most instances. We didn’t love the carrying handles and thought they could use some sort of padding for comfort. Likewise, many will be turned off by the steep price tag here. However, this is an awesome, straightforward work bag for those who are fans of Filson’s distinct, heritage-inspired design ethos. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: British Millerain waxed cotton canvas with EVA foam base Volume: 9L Weight: 2.6LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15” Best Heirloom Briefcase: Few companies know how to make heirloom-quality bags at reasonable prices. However, while Satchel & Page strikes a balance between affordable and premium price tag, its bags are anything but cheap. Inspired by a World War II-era map bag owned by its founder’s grandfather, the Dallas-based company sources his waterproof 20oz waxed leather canvas from a third-generation family tannery in Italy and manufactures its products in Europe. And it’s that amalgamation of regions that makes products such as their Aviator Brief so special. Made for office workers, the Aviator Brief has a rugged personality but is trimmed handsomely with French cowhide shoulders and given antique brass hardware. Inside, the padded laptop holds up to a 16-inch laptop and has plenty of pockets for organization. From first sight, the Aviator Brief was the most eye-catching of the bunch. Satchel & Page’s aesthetic is very distinct, bringing a sort of stylish simplicity to each piece that I can only describe as “nuanced minimalism.” Like the Filson above, the military-inspired green canvas isn’t the most office-ready but at least the S&P bag has plenty of features to serve its main purpose. Aside from the interior laptop sleeve, which is slightly suspended and situated towards the middle of the bag to keep it away from the sides, the inside has a larger zippered pocket, a few wider pouches, and purpose-built features for items like business cards a writing utensils. Each of the exterior sides has its own large zippered pocket. Also, this bag can stand up on its own thanks to the beefy boot at the bottom. I especially loved the attachable luggage pass-through buckle that threads through outside leather straps, making this a great travel option as well. And best of all, it makes a point to only thread through the side closest to the laptop. This is so that, if the bag falls, it will create a buffer between the ground and your computer. Likewise, the attachable shoulder strap is pretty comfortable on the neck thanks to the adjustable padding. There’s not statement from the brand on the exact capacity of the bag but estimates seem to put this at about 12L or more. From the look of the Aviator Brief to its meticulously designed interior, it doesn’t have a lot of downsides. Even the price, which is relatively similar to the Filson Tin Cloth briefcase, feels more appropriate here for all that you get. However, my biggest issue is the dry weight of the S&P briefcase. Although it’s listed at 3lbs, it feels a bit heavier than that. And seeing that you can fit quite a lot inside, this weight will only get higher. Of course, the high weight is also due to the thickness and density of the canvas and leather materials, which is also a good thing considering it’s housing your laptop and tech. As a minor complaint, the top handles don’t fall flat against the sides when this thing is idle. However, it seems like over time they could break in enough to bend the leather a bit more. Verdict: Arguably the best-looking bag on this list, the Aviator Brief takes Satchel & Page’s design language and transposes it for an office-ready briefcase, equipped with lots of meticulously-designed interior compartments and a laptop sleeve made to prevent any damage caused to your computer. We felt the bag was fairly priced for everything you get. However, we couldn’t help but notice how much heavier it is compared to other briefcases –– but this is just evident of how sturdy the construction is. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Waxed canvas from full-grain French cowhide shoulders Volume: Unspecified Weight: 3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 16” Best Backpack: Whether your place of work is just down the street, across town, or on the other side of the country, the Mission Workshop Rhake laptop backpack is undoubtedly a superb work bag for you. This particular version is made from ultra-tough, weatherproof VX-21 fabric — available in three striking colorways — and it can hold up to 22L of gear. It’s also compatible with the brand’s modular Arkiv system via dual exterior integrated rails. And the rolltop closure ensures that all your stuff will stay nice and dry, even if you’re riding your bicycle through a downpour. Aside from the 17-inch laptop compartment, there’s a 10-inch pocket for smaller devices around 10″. Admittedly, the Mission Workshop Rhake is a sight to behold, from both technical and aesthetic perspectives. It’s obvious that the folks behind the backpack have utilized their own real-world knowledge and experience when designing the pack. While the pack has a plethora of compartments, they’re built for organization and are incredibly easy to access and sort through. It can be a pain to rummage through your backpack to find a single item but the meticulous and thoughtful design streamlined this process every time. I loved the large zippered laptop pocket inside, which is unassuming and difficult enough to access for any potential thieves. Likewise, the polyester lining inside creates a barrier between the main pocket and the laptop sleeve –– which is suspended for protection. Utilizing both inside and outside space, the bag sports a large primary rolltop compartment that’s adjustable in size and is perfect for storing bulkier items like a jacket or a lunch box. However, my favorite feature might be the set of buckles below the closure that secures a couple of zippered fold-out pockets. These, as well as the horizontally-running zippered pocket on the front face, are perfect for EDC or tech storage. Each element of the backpack serves a distinct purpose for either convenience or utility. I should also point out how comfortable the shoulder straps are and how easy they are to adjust. At $545, the Rhake is obviously not for the faint of heart. Perhaps a bit too much for some office workers, the backpack will intimidate with the same features that make it so great. However, considering all the features it had, I did wish there was a sort of water bottle pouch. Fortunately, there are enough attachment points that I was able to latch it on with a carabiner (this will only work if you have a closed-handle bottle). I also must mention that the sternum strap doesn’t adjust very far. In fact, I almost couldn’t buckle it in the center when it was loosened all the way –– this might be an issue for broader individuals. Verdict: Utilizing every inch of the backpack, Mission Workshop has outdone itself with the Rhake. Perhaps a bit intimidating for some, this highly-capable technical pack is purpose-built for carrying a laptop to the office (or anywhere, really) and doing so protected from the elements thanks to the weatherproof X-Pac shell. We loved the unique arrangement of tech and EDC storage on the outside, which is easy to access. However, we do know the price will be a bit steep for many buyers. Nevertheless, the Rhake is one of our favorites for a reason. Check out our in-depth Mission Workshop Rhake review here. Type: Backpack Primary Construction: X-Pac VX-21 Volume: 22L Weight: 3.8LBs Laptop Sleeve: 17″ Best Premium Briefcase: If the two canvas briefcases above are too heritage-inspired for you, check out the Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase from Carl Friedrik, an uber-classy white-collar option with a modern look. Holding 10L of gear, it’s available in both smooth and grained vegetable-tanned Italian vachetta leather with nylon lining inside and custom nickel-plated hardware. The dedicated laptop sleeve fits models up to 15″ while the fabric shoulder strap is very soft and easy to stow. At $745, the Palissy is quite the investment but will certainly complement a suit and tie with ease. In the past year or so, we’ve really grown to love Carl Friedrik’s design language, with its minimalist simplicity and touches of almost Deco-inspired lines. We went with the smooth leather option as well, for its flatter appearance. As a side note, the bag exudes a beautiful leather aroma. On the inside, the laptop compartment has an interesting open design, where the top half is exposed. Perhaps controversial, this feature does make access a breeze. If I’m running late for a meeting, it removes an extra step in my setup. There aren’t a ton of extra features inside but there are pockets for pens and business cards, as well as both small- and medium-sized pouches for other tech gear. There’s one compartment on the outside but I’m honestly not sure what it’s for; it’s way too tight to put most things inside. While the bag weighs 3.3lbs, it feels very lightweight. Even if you pack it full, the top handles are comfortable for longer stints of carrying it and the lightweight fabric shoulder strap is really comfortable on the neck. Obviously, $745 is a lot to spend on a briefcase but this is aimed at white collar workers with a higher budget, and will certainly appeal to that crowd. While I loved the open design to the laptop compartment for its easy access, I couldn’t help but feel like it was going to come out in transit (it never did). However, my bigger concern is the lack of suspension with this sleeve, which would prevent any unfortunate damage caused by repeated drops of this bag. On the other hand, Carl Friedrik has put metal feet on the bottom of the bag for separation, so that’s a plus. Verdict: Designed for a white-collar environment, the Carl Friedrik Palissy Slim Leather Briefcase is a handsome, classy bag that’s light in weight. Instantly stunning on a visual level, the bag also has useful interior elements like pen pockets and an laptop sleeve that’s partially exposed for easy access –– a feature that might be controversial for some. At $745, this won’t be for everyone but it’s the perfect briefcase for those who can afford it. Type: Briefcase Primary Construction: Italian vachetta leather Volume: 10L Weight: 3.3LBs Laptop Sleeve: 15″ Briefcases: Boasting a dignified and elegant air, briefcases are a traditional style of work bags that have been sized to carry laptops, documents, and other notebook-sized office essentials. Not unlike messenger bags, briefcases typically sport a low-profile, rectangular shape that comes equipped with a shoulder strap for easy carrying. With briefcases admittedly lack the storage space and organizational amenities of backpacks and larger messenger bags, they can still make for fantastic carry solutions for work, being able to accommodate your daily essentials — and typically not much else. Messenger Bags: Traditionally worn by bicycle messengers, messenger bags are a modern type of carry solution that borrows traits from briefcases, slings, and backpacks. Designed to be worn over the shoulder or across the back, messenger bags can range from compact, simple, and streamlined models to larger, more elaborate vessels brimming with storage space and organizational amenities. And, while these bags obviously still immensely conducive to cycling — and motorcycling — they still make for stellar work bags for those who commute by car, train, or on foot. Backpacks: Backpacks have long been the most popular type of daily carry solution — and for good reason. These storage and carrying solutions offer a generous amount of storage space and an equally robust array of organizational features. A more evolved take on the book bags you likely used in your youth, these bags can hugely differ in terms of style and aesthetics, practically guaranteeing that there’s a backpack out there that will jive with your personal taste. Bellroy does a great job with its minimalist, straightforward items, from wallets to backpacks. We do really like their Tokyo Work Bag as well but just couldn’t justify selecting this messenger bag over our favorites above. Known for resurrecting an old shoe polish company and turning into a modern-day watch brand with vintage Americana aesthetics, Shinola has expanded beyond mere watchmaking with an array of items for both office and lifestyle spaces. So is true with the Runwell Messenger Bag, a classy option, albeit one with a steep $900 price tag. KILLSPENCER is a great brand who does a nice job with its leather bags. However, at $1,500, this Esquire Briefcase is really nice but we couldn’t justify it for the price and considering we already had some solid leather picks above, and for less money. We really love the work that Tom Bihn does with its luggage and bags, and this Tri-Star messenger bag is no different with its unique compartment layout and durability. However, we simply couldn’t get our hands on a unit for testing this time around. Mystery Ranch does some great job if you’re into outdoor tactical bags, and make work bags as well such as this 3 Way Expandable Briefcase. However, we felt the more office-focused approach was better for this guide. Rickshaw makes a Reddit-favorite work bag called the Medium Zero Messenger but we weren’t necessarily blown away by it.

Published onFebruary 16, 2025 When Android 15 landed with Private Space in tow, everyone — me included — winked at their screen and nodded, knowing exactly what that new feature would be used for. I won’t delve into your or my private business; that’s not exactly my jam. But when I activated Private Space on my Pixel 9 Pro (it’s a Pixel exclusive for now), I realized that it’s a very powerful and unique addition to my Android phone that enables me to do things I couldn’t before. With time, I’ve come across five different use cases for Private Space that make it essential for me because of security, privacy, distraction management, or convenience. If you’re not familiar with the feature, check out how to activate and use Private Space, and then follow me as I explain how I personally use it. If my Android phone falls into the hands of a thief, especially if they manage to snatch it from me when it’s unlocked or if they somehow steal my PIN code, I don’t want them to have access to my most sensitive apps. Hiding financial apps under Private Space, and making sure Private Space itself is hidden too, adds one more layer of security. This ensures that thieves or nosy people either don’t see these apps at all or aren’t able to access them because they’re locked behind a different PIN code. (Google has a disclaimer about malicious apps or adb being able to detect private apps, but I still think it’s worth it for being one more layer to deter petty thieves.) I do leave one banking app in the main app drawer, though — usually the one with the smallest account and no credit card access. That’s usually my day-to-day account. The other apps often live in my Private Space, though I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I never receive any notifications from them because of the feature’s limitation. That’s usually fine, except for French banking apps, which always require me to validate any online payment by going through the app and agreeing. Since I don’t get any notifications, I have to manually unlock Private Space, open the app, and then agree to the payment pop-up, but that’s a small price to pay for extra security. I’ve also tried putting the apps for my smart lock and security system in Private Space to stop anyone from opening my front door or disarming my alarm, but the problem is that I do definitely rely on getting notifications from these apps. A workaround would be to create two users with different permissions — one visible in my app drawer with limited powers and one hidden in Private Space with admin privileges — but I haven’t been able to dial in those permissions exactly to my liking. So for now, these apps remain in my main app list. I also attempted to hide 1Password, my password manager, to keep any passwords away from prying eyes, but I noticed that I heavily rely on it as an autofill solution and I can’t use that if it’s locked in private. Manually checking login details every time was very inconvenient. I know that using two different password managers would circumvent that, but it’s a very overkill solution for me, for now. Notifications aren’t the only thing that Private Space stops. The feature essentially sandboxes and quarantines apps in a separate environment with no access to my contacts, calendar, files, photos, or anything else on my phone. And that’s absolutely perfect when I want to use an app that I don’t completely trust. Sometimes it’s an app from a developer I don’t know, sometimes it’s a random app I’m briefly testing and want to delete later, and sometimes, it’s just Twitter X. No matter the reason, if there’s an app I’m not so sure about or want to keep away from the rest of my phone, then Private Space is where I’ll install it. That way I know that I’m giving it less room to roam and less data to siphon by default. Plus, when Private Space is locked, potentially problematic apps can’t perform any background actions, use any of my phone’s sensors, or track me across other apps. Private Space keeps them off and offline, and I love that. I have four Google accounts, three of which I use daily (personal, work, and shared with my husband). The fourth one is an old shared account that my husband and I created on a trip to Austria when we were still living in Lebanon. It was meant to help us get access to Google features and apps that were available in the EU but not on a Lebanese account. Since then, we’ve moved to France and created a shared French account, so this fourth account is not longer essential. But it still has a thing or two that we care about and that we weren’t able to migrate or were too lazy to migrate. Since I rarely use this account, I don’t want it installed on my phone, littering every account picker and account switcher menu. I just want access to some things a few times a year. Previously, I accessed it from the browser sometimes or added it to my phone then remove it, but not anymore. Now, that’s the account I associate with my Private Space account and I can just let it be, untouched, for weeks on end, then when I need to check it, I just unlock Private Space and open Gmail, Chrome, Keep, or Maps to check it out. If I could quarantine all of my apps, I would, but for now, Instagram and Threads would have to do. Keeping them locked away means I’m not tempted to open them when I see that icon in my app drawer. With no notifications and no background updates, they have no way to disturb me, either. I’ve tried putting a time restriction on apps with Digital Wellbeing, but that didn’t do much, and I always ended up unpausing the app once the timer hit. With Private Space, I find that I’m less inclined to open the app because it’s hidden away from my eyes. Out of sight, out of mind, as the proverb says. There are a million and one reasons for why you’d need to have two instances of the same app, and the sad part is that stock Android doesn’t allow this when other skins offer it. With Private Space, though, we have a workaround that lets us create a second and independent instance of an app on a Pixel phone. I find this is very useful in apps that don’t allow me to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time. Amazon, for example, requires a multi-step process to let me switch from my French account to my US, German, Spanish, or Italian ones. And since some items are sometimes heavily discounted in other countries but not in France, I just want quick access to those countries’ stores without messing with my main account. That’s why I use a secondary instance of Amazon to check prices and order items from other countries. I also have two Spotify accounts in different locales that are useful when I come across geo-restricted music. Instead of logging out and in again, I can just check my second account, see if it’s available there, then decide if it’s worth going through any extra hoops to listen to that music or not. It’s a very restricted use case, but it’s come in handy once or twice. There are also other apps where I have both a personal account and a joint one with my husband. Booking.com, GetYourGuide, ChatGPT, and Uber are some of the ones that come to mind, and being able to have both accounts logged in on the same phone is a time-saver. This is where my journey with Private Space ends for now. I know that for many, it’s a convenient way to hide their dirtiest secrets, but I really appreciate the feature for its immense potential. I just hope to see it come to stock Android and stop being a Pixel-exclusive feature.
