A $1.2 billion exchangeable bond deal announced last week by Uber Technologies reportedly features a rare structure that is appealing to investors and to Uber. The deal is tied to Uber’s shares in self-driving truck firm Aurora Innovation and includes bonds that turn into equity if the stock exceeds a set price after a set period, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20). The deal allows investors to participate in the upside of Aurora’s business while limiting the downside, as they could end up with a valuable stake if the price of the shares rises above the conversion threshold, while they can get paid back the par value of the bond at maturity if the stock drops, according to the report. For Uber, the deal provided favorable terms that included zero coupon and a conversion premium above the marketed range, the report said. Uber retains some upside and can defer tax on the gains. Only about 6% of total U.S. convertible debt over the past five years has had an exchangeable bond structure, but that share may increase among companies with solid credit and adequate stakes in other companies, the report said. Uber announced its plans for a private placement of exchangeable senior notes in a May 13 press release. It announced the pricing of the offering in another press release on the same day. “Uber intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include strategic investments, although Uber has not designated any specific uses at this time,” the company said in the first release. Aurora is developing self-driving systems for commercial vehicles like trucks and plans to deploy driverless trucks at scale. When announcing the company’s first quarter results on May 8, Aurora Innovation Co-Founder and CEO Chris Urmson noted that its self-driving trucks are now hauling commercial freight on Texas roads. “We are the first company to operate commercial driverless heavy-duty trucks on public roads,” Urmson said in a press release. “From here we’ll focus on proving the promise of the technology, increasing the value of our product for customers and ultimately becoming an essential partner in the freight industry.” Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure Google to Partner With Eyewear Brands on AI-Equipped Smart Glasses Keep Raises $78 Million for Financial Platform for Canada’s Small Businesses Google Unveils Sweeping AI Upgrades Across Search, Android and Cloud We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Wikimedia Commons / David Maiolo More than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies — even as they oversee and regulate them. Select a question above or ask something else Members of Congress help shape the future of the travel industry — and some are personally investing in it, too. A Skift analysis of congressional financial disclosures reveals that more than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in airlines, hotel chains, cruise companies, and travel tech firms. In all, federal lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 individual travel industry-related stock trades since the 2021-2022 congressional session, congressional financial records indicate. Taken together, the purchases and sales are worth well into the millions of dollars. Shares of Marriott International, Airbnb, Uber, Hilton Worldwide, and Booking Holdings rank among the most frequently traded common stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Members of Congress are legally allowed to buy and sell individual stocks as long as they don’t violate the anti-insider trading provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act. They must disclose their trades within 45 days. Dozens of members of Congress have violated these disclosure rules in the past decade. And a growing number of elected Republicans and Democrats alike want to limit or ban trading individual stocks. Even some of Congress’ most prolific travel stock traders tell Skift that they’re rethinking their investment strategies or have recently stopped trading individual stocks. “The travel and tourism industry is affected by tax implications, subsidies, lots of decisions,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. “Lawmakers can pass a stock ban … they could just invest in broad-based mutual funds right now.” Here is Skift’s company-by-company assessment of which federal lawmakers are trading travel and tourism industry stocks: In all, eight members of Congress disclosed making recent Booking Holdings stock trades within their immediate families, including Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Reps. Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.), Bill Keating (D-Mass.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas). No travel and tourism industry company is more frequently traded by members of Congress than Booking Holdings, the parent company of brands such as Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak and OpenTable. Lawmakers and their spouses bought or sold shares of Booking Holdings at least 85 times during the past four years, according to Skift’s analysis of congressional financial disclosures. In an email to Skift, Elliot Berke, an attorney for McCaul, indicated that the congressman’s wife, Linda Mays McCaul, daughter of Clear Channel Communications founder Lowry Mays, made the trades. “McCaul did not purchase these stocks and had no advanced knowledge of the purchase. Rather, his wife has assets she solely owns, and a third-party manager made the purchase without her direction,” Berke said. Khanna has disclosed more than 50 trades in Booking Holdings that his congressional office attributes to his wife, Ritu Khanna, and their dependent children. The stock’s share price has nearly tripled during the past five years. Khanna has reported thousands of stock trades overall for his wife and children. “Rep. Khanna’s wife’s money is in a trust managed by an independent party, and it’s diversified,” spokesperson Sarah Drory told Skift. “Under official government ethics guidance, diversified trusts eliminate conflicts. The trades in tourism are a part of that trust and are a very small percentage of it. Rep. Khanna and his wife do not trade any stocks. Rep. Khanna has been a leader in calling for a stock ban and is a co-sponsor of the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act and he also introduced a political reform plan that bans stock trading.” As for Harshbarger, she made her Booking Holdings trades in 2022 and has last reported trading any stock at all in 2023, according to federal records. Harshbarger’s final trades from two years ago included shares of Hyatt Hotels — she’s the only federal lawmaker to report recent purchases or sales of Hyatt stock. Marriott International counts Reps. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.), Gottheimer, McCaul, Lee and Khanna among its recent investors. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and the wife of Rick Allen (R-Ga.) also report Marriott stock holdings of $15,001 to $50,000 each, although they haven’t bought or sold shares recently. Marriott is the most popular hotel stock among congressional members, with 67 individual trades. Jackson said he employs a financial adviser and that he wasn’t aware he had purchased between $30,002 and $100,000 worth of Marriott stock during 2023. “I don’t know anything about it,” Jackson said. “I have not directed any trades. My financial adviser stays on it.” Lee, the Nevada Democrat, “is currently in the process of transferring holdings she received following her divorce into ETFs, index funds, and mutual funds, going above and beyond what’s required of her by law and ethics rules,” spokesperson Christopher D’Aloia said in an email. “Representative Lee has never directed an individual stock trade prior to her divorce, and she strongly supports a ban on members of Congress directing trades of individual stocks. Representative Lee had no knowledge of trades made in accounts managed by her ex-husband.” Reps. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), Rob Bresnahan (R-Pa.), Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.), Khanna, Keating, Gottheimer, and Guest each reported Airbnb trades in recent years. Members of Congress and their spouses executed 59 Airbnb stock trades in recent years. Like many of the other companies whose stock members of Congress have traded, Airbnb maintains a strong political presence in Washington, D.C. For example, it spent at least $940,000 each year for the past three years on federal-level government lobbying efforts, according to lobbying records compiled by OpenSecrets. Goldman is among the lawmakers who says he stopped trading individual stocks and is no longer buying and selling shares of Airbnb — or anything else. "As elected representatives endowed with the public trust, members of Congress must uphold the highest ethical standards and avoid even the appearance of a possible conflict of interest,” Goldman confirmed to Skift in an email. “Upon entering Congress, I sold all individual stock holdings and placed my assets into a blind trust to ensure that my constituents can be certain that I represent their interests and their interests alone. It's long past time for Congress to pass a bill banning stock trading by members of Congress and executive branch officials." Gottheimer, for his part, has taken steps to detach himself from travel and other stock trades made on his behalf, spokesperson Tony Wen said. “Prior to taking office, Josh turned over management of his retirement savings and investments to a third party, who has full investment discretion,” Wen said. “Throughout his time in Congress, decisions related to his managed investments have been made at the direction of that third party. Josh is also awaiting approval from Congress of a blind trust. In the meantime, he has taken the extra step of setting up an independent trust.” Wen added that Gottheimer is “working to pass legislation — to ensure that every Member of Congress, judge, or government employee in a policy role, should be required to place any stocks or bonds in a blind trust to ensure they have no direct involvement in their investments.” Members of Congress and their spouses have disclosed executing 37 trades in the hotel company’s stock in recent years. Sens. John Curtis (R-Utah) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) and Reps. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), Shreve, Khanna, and McCaul are among them. Lawmakers who’ve invested in Boeing include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), Blake Moore (R-Utah), Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), Julie Johnson (D-Texas), Hern, Keating, Bresnahan, Cisneros, and Shreve. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) also reported holding a Boeing stock investment worth between $15,001 and $50,000 but has not traded the stock recently. The American airplane manufacturer and defense contractor is another popular investment target for congressional lawmakers — 11 of them reported making a combined 21 trades in recent years. Cisneros’ office did not respond to Skift’s requests for comment, but spokesperson Nic Jordan told Fortune in March that the California Democrat has “never abused his official position to benefit a private entity.” Keating, a Democrat from Massachusetts who served on the House Armed Services Committee, sold five-figure investments in Boeing last year — a move that Keating’s office attributed to a financial adviser but that ethics watchdogs criticized, Raw Story reported. Joyce failed to properly disclose Boeing stock trades in violation of the STOCK Act, Newsweek reported last year. Each year since 2008, Boeing has spent at least $11 million on federal-level government lobbying efforts, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets. Representatives who’ve traded Uber include Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.), John James (D-Mich.), Michael Guest (R-Miss.), Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), Bresnahan, Cisneros, Johnson, McCaul, Gottheimer, Khanna, and Shreve. Uber is the most popular travel and tourism industry stock in Congress when measured by the number of lawmakers — 11 — who’ve reported trading it during the past four years. Shreve, a freshman, is already one of the most active stock traders in Congress. NOTUS reported this week that Shreve, a member of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, bought or sold shares in several companies that fall within the committee’s jurisdiction. He bought between $15,001 and $50,000 worth of Uber stock on April 7, congressional records indicate. Shreve spokesperson Hannah Benfield declined to answer several of NOTUS’ questions but said in a written statement: “Congressman Shreve relies on a financial advisor to conduct trades. He hired a professional to ensure compliance with all transaction reporting requirements for members of Congress.” Uber is politically active, spending more than $2.6 million in 2024 to lobby the federal government, according to federal lobbying records compiled by OpenSecrets. The company donated $1 million to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, with CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also personally donating $1 million. Uber was among several companies that sent a letter in October 2023 to Comer, then chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, urging him to investigate the practice of third-party litigation funding, arguing that its “negative effects on U.S. civil litigation are manifold.” Comer reported purchasing up to $15,000 worth of Uber shares on Jan. 2, according to a congressional financial filing. Landsman’s Uber trades violated the STOCK Act due to late disclosures. Landsman said last month he would stop trading. Three members of Congress — Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Frankel and Khanna — reported a combined 17 trades in Expedia Group. Lofgren violated the STOCK Act in 2023 when she failed to properly report various stock trades, including her husband’s sale of up to $15,000 worth of Expedia Group stock, Raw Story reported. “All of these transactions, which are related to my husband’s solo practice retirement accounts, are managed by a financial adviser. I do not know about them until they are reported. If there is a late fee owed, it will be paid,” Lofgren said at the time. First-time violators of the STOCK Act’s disclosure provisions are supposed to pay a $200 civil fine, although the House and Senate ethics committees have jurisdiction to waive this fine — and regularly do. Expedia Group’s brands include Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotwire.com, Orbitz, CheapTickets, CarRentals.com and Trivago. Rep. John James (R-Mich.) failed to properly disclose stock trades, including a 2023 purchase of up to $15,000 in Las Vegas Sands shares. It prompted Democrat-supporting political group End Citizens United to file an ethics complaint against the congressman. In a letter to the U.S. House Clerk’s Office, James acknowledged the error, “It is critical to note that there has been no impropriety nor has any impropriety been alleged,” James wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Detroit News. “Regardless, my team and I are committed to providing accurate information quickly and in a transparent, forthright manner. Moreover, I am taking aggressive measures to ensure these types of errors do not occur in the future.” McCaul, Johnson, and Khanna also reported Las Vegas Sands trades, with the four lawmakers combining to disclose nearly 30 trades in the hotel and casino company in all during the past four years. Johnson, the Texas Democrat, is among Congress’ most active stock traders and dumped nearly 80 different stocks on April 1, the day before Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, NOTUS reported. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Reps. Lee and Khanna combined to report 15 stock trades in the hotel company. Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), Lee, Cisneros, Moody, Khanna, and Hern combined to make a dozen reported stock trades in the hotel company. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Goldman, and Khanna combined to make 10 trades in the company, a real estate investment trust that has several dozen hotel properties — concentrated along the coasts — in its portfolio. Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines are the most popular stock-trading targets among federal lawmakers. Reps. Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), Comer, Cisneros, and Khanna, as well as Sullivan, the senator from Alaska, combined to report 24 trades in recent years. Delta Air Lines has been a trading target for Rep. Morgan McGarvey (D-Ky.), Bresnahan, Shreve, Khanna, Johnson, and Goldman, who combined to make 22 trades. Rep. Tim Moore (R-N.C.) and Khanna reported American Airlines trades, while Khanna and Goldman have traded United Airlines stock. Khanna alone reported trades in Alaska Airlines, while Gottheimer was the only lawmaker to report a trade in Allegiant Air. Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kansas) is the only member of Congress to report a trade in Spirit Airlines, having sold shares in 2022. Prior to swearing off individual stock trading, Goldman also traded shares of foreign carriers Qantas, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, as well as European airplane manufacturer Airbus. No federal lawmaker reported making recent trades of JetBlue, Frontier, SkyWest, or Sun Country Airlines stock. Carnival Corp. is the most popular cruise stock among lawmakers, with seven lawmakers combining to report 25 trades in recent years, including Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Reps. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), Lee, Shreve and Khanna. Meanwhile, Reps. George Whitesides (D-Calif.), Bresnahan, Khanna, and Lee have traded Royal Caribbean stock, while Moody and Khanna have disclosed trades in Norwegian Cruise Lines. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-Md.) alone reported a trade in Viking Holdings, the company that specializes in high-end river cruises. In March, Whitesides sold between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of his Royal Caribbean stock — part of what his congressional office described as “the first of many actions” to “target government corruption” while in office. He also dumped his stake in Virgin Galactic Holdings, where he previously served as the space tourism company’s CEO. “Rep. Whitesides is promoting best practices that he believes every member of Congress should follow to avoid any possible conflict of interest with his future work,” Whitesides spokesperson Natalie Gould said in a statement to OpenSecrets. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has become so known for congressional stock trading that Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) named a stock-ban bill he introduced after her — the “PELOSI Act.” Pelosi does not personally trade stocks, but her husband, Paul Pelosi, makes tens of millions of dollars worth of personal stock and stock option trades each year, according to federal records. She has also expressed skepticism about stock-trade bans. The Pelosis tend to avoid travel and tourism industry stocks, but the California congresswoman did report an investment of between $50,001 and $100,000 in Massachusetts-based Citycar Services LLC, which provides limousine services.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that’s increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That’s helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America’s 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country’s richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year’s list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton “Tony” James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America’s three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren’t just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America’s nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year’s group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump’s secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year’s list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year’s ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year’s hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin’s stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump’s future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank’s shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant’s billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm’s other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG’s stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company’s stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher’s stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn’t go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm’s cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company’s struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It’s now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm’s stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he’s netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm’s European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone’s stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant’s chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America’s richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft’s billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft’s own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company’s stock, but that’s just enough to make him a billionaire—when combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years

It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out. Man causes problems and then fixes the problems." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

Title: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’ Review: Benicio Del Toro Hilariously Dominates Wes Anderson’s Latest All-Star Wes Anderson Movie – Cannes Film Festival

By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. An auteur in the truest sense of the word, he is as much a painter with words and visuals that put us unquestionably into part of a brain that sees the world the way he wants to see it. There’s his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‘s Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Sure, there are the usual starry cameos running through the story, but it is all in the service of Zsa-zsa, a man who dominated the business world and global economy in Europe in the early 1950s in much the same way we see Elon Musk now, an equally shady rich guy whose track record is spotty at best. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits — you name it, he’s done it. But is it all bad? Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The Phoenician Scheme’s Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera & Mia Threapleton On Wes Anderson’s Comedic Timing – Cannes Studio Zsa-zsa, who has survived six airplane crashes including the latest one that opens the film on a note of excitement, is even starting to see God, or at least a group of religious leaders who act as therapists in a way in fantasy sequences where he thinks he has died. Somehow he never does, even with a price on his head by any number of would-be assassins. His latest plan, with the lofty name of the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme, has him enlisting his 20-year-old daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), who is in training to become a nun but whom he thinks could be better suited to ultimately take over his company and complicated financial dealings. Why not his nine — count ’em — nine sons (another Musk comparison)? He wants to give Liesl a shot. The idea is to create an infrastructure scheme for an unused area of Earth that can be mined for a potentially rich region that doesn’t exist yet. In return, his business takes in 5% of the newfound riches in perpetuity. To do this he also has to enlist a number of wealthy donors from the worlds of shipping, mining, railroad, banking, real estate and the black market. Their identities all are contained in a set of shoeboxes, each with a particular specialty. RELATED: Cannes Film Festival 2025: Read All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews First up is a visit to Prince Farouk (Riz Ahmed), who has proven savvy with his kingdom’s natural wealth, then to an underground tunnel for a meeting with railroad barons Leland (Tom Hanks) and Reagan (Bryan Cranston). Another box introduces us to Marseilles Bob (Mathieu Amalric), a gangster and nightclub owner who wants terrorists to stop shooting up his place. There alsois the shipping magnate (Jeffrey Wright) who could be crucial; a second cousin named Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, in briefly) who could be new wife material; and finally leading up to his brother, the conniving Uncle Nubar (a very amusing Benedict Cumberbatch), who is big trouble in the family. With Liesl just as interested in trying to solve her mother’s murder (could it be Nubar?) as in closing the gap of Zsa-zsa’s vast finances, they are on dueling paths, joined by the other major character to complete this triangle, that of Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera), who also studies insects. Of course he does! As Anderson explains the mindset of Zsa-zsa, “he is a certain type of businessman who can always pivot. He has no obligation to the truth.” The director cites all sorts of real-life figures from the past as inspirations for this man, people only a Jeopardy! contestant might be able to reel off instantly, but you can certainly see the Trump/Musk influence creeping in, even though this was written long before their partnership got into the picture. At least that is what I sniff here, proving Anderson’s wholly fictional creation has some odd relation to our current reality. Can you imagine Zsa-zsa living in these times? RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d’Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery As with all Anderson films, the production values are spectacular. This one was shot almost exclusively on soundstages at Studio Babelsberg in Germany. Bruno Delbonnel’s lush cinematography (first time working on a feature with Anderson, who usually goes back to the same well of artisans) and Adam Stockhausen’s production design are exquisite as are Milena Canonero’s costumes and Alexandre Desplat’s score. The film belongs lock, stock and barrel to Del Toro, playing this Onassis-style billionaire who proves again to be so adept to the rhythms of Anderson’s dialogue and delivers flawlessly here. So do newcomer Threapleton as Liesl and Cera, a first-timer in Anderson’s stock company who undoubtedly will be asked back. Ahmed and Cumberbatch also are welcome additions, as is regular Richard Ayoade as a terrorist leader. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as pop-ups along the way, with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day’s work. Anderson, Jeremy Dawson, John Peet and Steven Rales are producers.

Title: Bitcoin Is Headed To $1 Million Thanks To Increasingly Favorable Macro Tailwinds, Says Crypto Legend Hayes
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-is-headed-to-1-million-thanks-to-increasingly-favorable-macro-tailwinds-says-crypto-legend-hayes/
Time Published: 2025-05-17T07:13:37Z
Full Content:
Earlier this month, the price of Bitcoin smashed the $100,000 milestone for the first time since February as U.S. President Donald Trump teased a major trade deal. Now, Arthur Hayes is predicting that the apex crypto will rocket to $1 million in just three years, thanks to macro tailwinds. The former BitMEX CEO reiterated his uber-bullish forecast in his latest blog post. Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin could surge to seven figures in a few years, owing to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury, suggesting that Bitcoin will become the preferred haven for investors everywhere. “Foreign capital repatriation and the devaluation of the gargantuan stock of U.S. treasuries will be the two catalysts that will power Bitcoin to $1 million sometime between now and 2028,” the BitMEX founder said in his May 15 blog. Hayes timed his forecast to the next US presidential election when a less crypto-friendly president might assume office. “I say 2028, because that is when the next US presidential election occurs, and who knows what type of politician will win and what policies they will enact,” he wrote. “Maybe by some stroke of divine intervention, the American public is ready to accept the monetary hangover for the profligacy of the last century and extinguish the rotten credit destroying their society,” the crypto OG said. “Therefore, the time is now to make hay while the sun king takes a shine to Bitcoin.” Hayes, who was pardoned in late March by U.S. President Trump after having pleaded guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, went on to suggest that Trump will shift gears from tariffs to capital control. This will spook investors, who Hayes thinks will exit the United States with their capital. He reckons the US will print more money in a form similar to quantitative easing to make up for capital leaving the U.S. “It’s the same answer as always,” said Hayes. “If the foreigners won’t supply the dollars, the government will by using its printing press.” As a result, he believes President Trump is likely to shift policies, which will ultimately be a boon for Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere,” Hayes postulated. Hayes has often maintained that Bitcoin will end up taking off like a rocket due to the U.S.’s monetary policy of printing cash.
