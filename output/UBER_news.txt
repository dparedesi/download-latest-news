This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. There are, of course, two components to affordability: sellers’ prices and buyers’ incomes. For most American families, buying (or renting) focuses either heavily or entirely on life’s essentials: housing, food, transportation, education, health care, and other forms of care (child, senior). That a clear majority of American families are, at minimum, stressed by these costs is a consequence of not just a host of factors on the sellers’ side, but of one big factor on the buyers’ side: a half-century of wage stagnation, even as investment income has soared. Or, if you prefer, a half-century of buyers’ income stagnation, even as sellers’ income has soared. More from Harold Meyerson If you depend on investments for most of your income, this is a pretty damn good time. The University of Michigan’s November survey of consumer sentiment finds that Americans who don’t own stock have their lowest confidence level in the economy since the survey began querying stock ownership in 1998. An exception to this mood, the survey notes, is found among the largest stock owners, whose assessment of the economy has actually risen by 11 percent this year. As Emma Janssen has reported in these pages, marketers are going where the money is, like bank robber Willie Sutton. First-class and business-seat travel on the airlines is booming, so much so that seating arrangements on Delta and United are being reconfigured to create more room for the affluent, while coach seats are going unfilled and “discount” airlines struggle. Revenues are up 3 percent this year at the Ritz-Carltons, the Four Seasons, and other luxury hotels, yet down by 3 percent at economy hotels. And when it comes to life’s biggest purchase—a home—the median age of first-time buyers reached 40 this year, an all-time high according to the National Association of Realtors. “All right,” as John Dos Passos wrote in his U.S.A. trilogy in the depth of the Depression, “we are two nations.” Life in the nonaffluent nation is getting harder. According to a Brookings Institution analysis from last year, 43 percent of American families don’t earn enough to pay for housing, food, health care, child care, and transportation; every week, they must juggle which to pay and which not to pay. Among Black and Latino families, those figures rise to 59 percent and 66 percent, respectively. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. It has not been ever thus. In the roughly 30 years following the end of World War II, the nation experienced an unprecedented period of broadly shared prosperity, with workers’ incomes rising in tandem with the nation’s growth in productivity. In 1947, workers captured 70 percent of the total national income; today, that has fallen to roughly 59 percent, while investment income has gained at workers’ expense. As a landmark 1995 study by economists Larry Mishel and Jared Bernstein for the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) revealed, a gap between the rise in productivity and the rise in median workers’ wages opened in the mid-1970s and has grown steadily wider since then; the difference between those two rates today is 55 percent. In the years between 1948 and 1979, when the egalitarian legacy of the New Deal was at its apogee, with high levels of unionization and progressive taxation and constraints on the financial sector, productivity grew by 108 percent and median worker’s compensation by 93 percent. In the years between 1979 and 2025, an EPI analysis found productivity grew by 87 percent but median worker’s compensation by a bare 33 percent. The declining share of national income going to workers hasn’t entirely been the result of the shift from wage income to investment income. There’s also been a shift in the distribution of corporate income to the most highly paid employees, through stock options and other forms of compensation. A 2021 EPI study shows that between 1979 and 2019, real yearly wages for the bottom 90 percent of workers increased by 26 percent, while the wages of those in the 95th to 99th percentile increased by 75 percent, for those in the top 1 percent by 160 percent, and for those in the top 0.1 percent by 345 percent. Worker pay ratios over the past decade have shown that CEOs usually make about 300 times what their median-paid employee makes, a far cry from the 1960s, when the ratio was roughly 20-to-1. Even as labor unions have largely disappeared in the past 60 years, the union of American CEOs—routinely appointed to the executive compensation committees of corporate boards with the blessing or at the instigation of the CEO whose pay they’re setting—has retained its power, adhering to the creed that an injury to one CEO (by, say, paying him or her less than 300 times what workers make) is an injury to all. What would America look like if the gap between worker pay and productivity hadn’t opened? A RAND Corporation study from earlier this year found that the bottom 90 percent of wage earners received about 67 percent of all taxable income in 1975. In 2019, the last year for which this data was available, they received 46.8 percent. Had that bottom 90 percent continued during the past half-century to make the same share of the national income they’d had in 1975, RAND calculates that by 2023 they would have made an additional $79 trillion. Just in the year 2023, they would have made an additional $3.9 trillion. As the size of the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. workforce is roughly 140 million people, that means that the average earner would have made about $28,000 more in 2023 than they actually did. Where have all those missing $28,000 paychecks gone? Well, our nation was home to 1,135 billionaires this year, whose aggregate net worth in 2024 came to a cozy $5.7 trillion. That’s $1.8 trillion more than what it would take to cut 140 million $28,000 paychecks. Corporations aren’t cutting those checks. As EPI’s Nominal Wage Tracker documents, the 80 percent of corporate income that went to employees in 1980 declined to 71.5 percent this year. This is the kind of thing that can irritate workers. As I write in mid-November, 3,200 members of the Machinists union have just completed a three-month strike at three Midwestern Boeing plants. Strikers noted that Boeing devoted $68 billion to stock buybacks between 2010 and 2024—funds that could have gone to developing safer and better planes, and better-compensated workers with more secure retirement benefits. THERE’S A REASON WHY 1979 HAS BECOME the last “postwar normal” year, before the massive upward redistribution of wealth and income, in most of these economic studies. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president. In his first few months in office, he signed a law reducing the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. (It’s about ten points lower than that today, though most of our super-rich have found ways to get it much closer to zero.) The high marginal tax rates of the postwar decades, peaking at 91 percent during Republican Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency, had effectively put a ceiling on CEO pay. Tesla’s board would not be committing to pay Elon Musk a trillion bucks if Tesla thrives in the coming years under 1950s-era tax rates, where the feds would take the lion’s share above the top marginal bracket. The pre-Reagan tax rates ensured that America’s billionaires would be few and far between, helping to ensure that workers’ potential income wouldn’t be siphoned upward. Twenty years after Reagan, George W. Bush became the first president to lower taxes on the rich during wartime (a war he decided to start absent a plausible threat), and Donald Trump’s successive cuts make even Reagan and Bush look like Keynesians. In 1982, Reagan’s appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) changed a rule that enabled shareholders to claim a greater percentage of corporate wealth. The SEC permitted corporate executives to authorize buybacks of the corporation’s stock, thereby raising the value of the remaining shares on the market. By the 1990s, due to a Clinton-era loophole exempting bonus compensation from corporate taxes, corporations began paying their top executives with shares and options of shares, which made buybacks an easy form of self-enrichment. As economist William Lazonick has exhaustively documented, by the 2000s, most major corporations were diverting more funds to buybacks and dividends than they were investing in growth and research, not to mention employees’ raises. During his first year in office, Reagan also busted PATCO, the air traffic controllers’ union, firing all its members when they went on strike. (By contrast, Republican Richard Nixon had allowed all hundreds of thousands of postal workers who’d participated in a wildcat strike in 1970 to return to their jobs: The Republican Party of Nixon’s day was still closer to the accept-the-New-Deal ethos of Eisenhower than the overturn-the-New-Deal ethos of Reagan.) Reagan’s mass firing inspired private-sector CEOs to do the same with their own employees. During the next several years, a representative sample of leading corporations—Phelps Dodge, Greyhound Bus, Boise Cascade, International Paper, Hormel meatpacking—all slashed pay to provoke strikes, then fired the strikers and hired their replacements at a fraction of their original salaries. During the years of postwar prosperity, strikes were a routine part of the economic landscape, and a major reason why worker pay constituted a decent share of the national income. After PATCO, they nearly disappeared. The number of major strikes plummeted from 286 a year in the 1960s and 1970s, to 83 a year in the 1980s, to 35 a year in the 1990s, to 20 a year in the 2000s. In recent years, the strike has enjoyed a modest revival—autoworkers and teaching assistants have won higher wages by walking picket lines—but unions have shrunk to the point that the fruits of such victories have limited ripple effects. Reagan wasn’t the sole agent of upward redistribution during this time. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker brought down inflation by raising interest rates so high that people stopped buying cars and construction projects slowed to a trickle. The industrial Midwest never recovered. Between 1979 and 1983, 2.4 million manufacturing jobs vanished. The number of U.S. steelworkers went from 450,000 at the start of the 1980s to 170,000 at decade’s end, even as the wages of those who remained shrank by 17 percent. The decline in auto manufacturing was even more precipitous, from 760,000 employees in 1978 to 490,000 three years later. These were the jobs whose union contracts had set the standard for the nation’s blue-collar workers. Finally, also in 1981, at New York’s Pierre Hotel, Jack Welch, General Electric’s new CEO, delivered a kind of inaugural address, which he titled “Growing Fast in a Slow-Growth Economy.” GE, Welch proclaimed, would shed all its divisions that weren’t number one or number two in their markets. If that meant shedding workers, so be it. All that mattered was pushing the company to pre-eminence, and the measure of a company’s pre-eminence was its stock price. Between late 1980 and 1985, Welch reduced the number of GE employees from 411,000 to 299,000. He cut basic research. The company’s stock price soared. And Welch became the model CEO for a corporate America going fully neoliberal. WHAT THE EARLY 1980S INAUGURATED GREW APACE over the subsequent 40 years. Emboldened by Reagan’s opposition to unions, CEOs and corporate boards routinely directed their companies to violate the laws that had empowered workers to form and join unions. In 2016 and 2017, employers were charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act in 41.5 percent of all unionization campaigns, often by firing workers involved in those campaigns. The penalties for being found guilty of such charges are negligible, and Democrats’ efforts to amend the NLRA so that the penalties actually have some effect on employer conduct have never been able to win the support of the 60 senators required to break a filibuster to enact such amendments. So it is that most unionized private companies were unionized many decades ago, and almost all the major companies that have been created since (including the two largest private-sector employers, Walmart and Amazon) have rebuffed their employees’ unionization efforts through illegal threats and firings. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Even when workers have managed to win unionization, that doesn’t mean they actually are able to bargain a first contract. An EPI study showed that 63 percent of the time during 2018, workers in newly unionized companies hadn’t been able to get their employer to agree to a contract within one year of their unionizing, as there’s no law requiring employers to bargain in a timely fashion. Amazon, for instance, has yet even to begin bargaining with the Staten Island warehouse workers, who decisively voted to join a union to much fanfare back in April of 2022. These are among the factors that explain why the rate of American worker unionization has declined from one-third in the middle of the 20th century to just under 10 percent today, and a bare 6 percent in the private sector. Another factor, both in the shrinking of unions and the shrinking of worker pay, is the move of major corporations’ production facilities from the unionized Northern and Midwestern states to the right-to-work, anti-union South. The spread of Southern pay standards to the rest of the nation—a tale whose protagonist is most certainly Walmart—also served to bring down national pay levels in retail. The late 1970s deregulation of the trucking industry, by effectively negating the Teamsters’ nationwide contract with long-distance trucking companies that had covered nearly half of U.S. truck drivers, proved to be a huge hit to drivers’ incomes, by some estimates cutting them in half. This November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The litany of the limits placed on workers’ ability to win sustaining incomes is long. Trade deals and offshoring have damaged workers considerably. NAFTA was the nation’s first trade treaty with a low-wage nation (Mexico), and our end-of-the-century trade deal with China greatly exacerbated the depressing effect on American workers’ wages. Both an EPI study and another by MIT’s David Autor and several co-authors independently concluded that such deals lowered the wage of non-college-graduate U.S. workers by 5.6 percent, taking an average bite out of their yearly income of roughly $2,000. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 currently comes to roughly 29 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. In 1968, the federal minimum wage came to 53 percent of the median full-time worker’s wage. Worker misclassification as independent contractors (as in the cases of Amazon delivery drivers and Uber and Lyft drivers) reduces incomes, exempts workers from wage and hour legislation, and generally means they lack the benefits (such as health insurance) that customarily accrue to corporate employees. EPI’s 2021 study on the factors reducing workers’ income estimated that nine million American workers were then misclassified, reducing their incomes by anywhere from 15 percent to 30 percent. A 2019 study by Brandeis University economist David Weil, who was in charge of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor during the Obama presidency, found that drivers employed directly by UPS, who also worked under a contract with the Teamsters, earned $23.10 an hour, while the “independent contractor” drivers for FedEx earned $14.40 an hour, and those for Amazon, a paltry $5.30 an hour. Amazon is currently in court contesting the unionization of a number of those drivers, making the argument that the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional. Noncompete agreements tucked into employment contracts forbid workers from taking a job with other businesses in the same sector or starting their own businesses in that sector. Initially devised to keep a small number of specialized employees from taking proprietary information to competitor companies, these agreements have now spread to workers at nail salons, barbershops, and just about any other kind of business. An EPI survey of businesses with at least 50 employees found that somewhere between one-quarter and one-half of all private-sector workers were subject to noncompetes. During the Biden presidency, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the NLRB found this practice to be a violation of law, and the FTC formally banned noncompetes nationwide. But those findings and rules have not been carried over, of course, to their Trump administration successors. Corporate concentration, as the other feature articles in this issue abundantly document, is a huge factor in price increases afflicting the American consumer. It’s also a factor in limiting American workers’ incomes. In 2017, MIT’s Autor and other co-authors estimated that the increase in product market concentration accounted for a third of the decline in labor’s share of the national income for the years between 1997 and 2012. The shrinking of employer options relieves employers of the pressure created by workers flocking to higher-paying rivals. In opposing the merger of the Albertsons and Kroger supermarket chains, Biden’s FTC argued that it would lead not only to price hikes but also to lower wages for their workers unless they remained separate companies. In weighing the relative responsibility of all these factors in creating the widening gap between productivity increases and median wage increases from 1979 through 2017, a 2021 EPI study by Lawrence Mishel and Josh Bivens concluded that excessive unemployment levels (due chiefly to Federal Reserve policies), the decline of collective bargaining, and globalization (devised by and benefiting corporations) explain roughly 55 percent of that gap, while misclassification of workers, subcontracting, noncompete agreements, and corporate concentration add up to 20 percent. OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS, THE FUNDAMENTALS of the postwar economy that were put in place by the New Deal have been discarded at the behest and insistence of wealthy interests and individuals who’ve sought a much higher share of the national income. Creating a more equitable economy—effectively, reinventing a vibrant American middle class—will be an arduous task. That said, this November’s elections reveal a public that understands the current system isn’t working for them or their neighbors. The affordability solutions put forth by Zohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, and Mikie Sherrill in their successful campaigns are just a start in what will be a long and difficult struggle. Herewith, some suggestions on the path to a more broadly shared prosperity and an affordable future. First, nothing increases worker bargaining power like full employment. The next Democratic president’s appointees to the Federal Reserve must be committed to raising ordinary Americans’ share of the national income. That requires the low interest rates essential for a thriving economy. Denmark’s policy of providing free job training and up to 90 percent of their salary to laid-off workers has been a success in boosting that nation’s employment levels and mitigating the effects of an economic downturn. Second, the return of collective bargaining. That necessitates labor law reforms that enable workers to unionize by signing affiliation cards; require employers to recognize unions when their workers have obtained those cards from a majority of employees; require employers to settle on contracts with unionized workers within a fixed time (90 days? 120 days?) or submit to compulsory arbitration; abolish “right to work” laws; make corporations the co-employers of record with their franchises; enable sector-wide bargaining in various sectors, thereby setting the same minimum wage and benefit standards for all of that industry’s employees, unionized or not; and perhaps enable bargaining from “minority” unions to which at least 25 percent of employees belong, so long as no union has achieved majority status. Today, unions are among the most well-thought-of American institutions, getting roughly 70 percent approval ratings in the annual Gallup polls, even as the rate of private-sector unionization is less than one-tenth of that. It’s primarily the weakness of labor law that has spawned this widest of gaps; that law must be changed if that gap is to shrink. Third, raise the minimum wage to the level of a living wage, sufficient to pay for all life’s essentials. An MIT study this year has estimated the living wage for a family in each of the 50 states, from $22.43 an hour in Mississippi to $34.55 in California. A federal law could mandate such procedures for the states. A paper released in October by California-based economists Martin Carnoy, Michael Reich, and Derek Shearer suggests an anti-inflationary accompaniment to such raises would be a rigorous antitrust policy that would yield more competitive pricing in retailing. Fourth, family-friendly financial policies. That could begin with a yearly federal payment to families with children, at an initial level of $5,000 per child. A Brookings Institution study has estimated that a middle-income family spends $310,605 to raise one child from birth to 17. The cost of child-rearing is such that it simply deters many families from having children. This is an area where our government must adopt the kind of policies that the governments of most nations with advanced economies have long since enacted. Universal free child care and pre-kindergarten could cut these costs to families, as well as enabling mothers to continue in their careers, which boosts family incomes. In a recent paper for the Economic Security Project, Becky Chao and Mike Konczal document that Americans generally become parents when their earnings have yet to achieve mid-career levels, making the prospect of having children a financially fraught one. They argue for substantial child tax credits and earned income tax credits to address this structural gap between the costs of parenting and the income levels of young workers. Similarly, they also argue for more generous Social Security payments for the elderly and disabled. Fifth, a ban on noncompete and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Sixth, the adoption of industrial policies, such as those advanced during the Biden administration, that revitalize domestic industries and lessen our dependence on imports from low-wage nations that have the effect of reducing the incomes of workers here at home. As the robotization of production work continues, manufacturing and transportation will employ fewer workers than they currently do, but the remaining workers in those sectors should not have their incomes reduced either by foreign competition or by the kinds of employment arrangements and opposition to unions that currently characterize our economy. Where unions have power, they can insist that smaller workforces receive the benefits of higher productivity, as the longshore unions have succeeded in doing during the past decades of mechanization and containerization, making their members’ jobs the highest-paying blue-collar jobs in America. Seventh, a thorough reworking of our tax system. Higher taxes on the rich and corporations are clearly needed to fund the kind of programs listed above, and with the nation’s wealth disparities reaching stratospheric proportions, some form of wealth taxes must be adopted as well. The best argument for adopting such a tax is that right now, only the most common and widely held form of wealth—homes—is subjected to that kind of tax. If we can tax the wealth of middle-income families, why can’t we tax the wealth—such as stocks and other investments—of the truly wealthy? Certainly, the capital gains tax should be raised to the level of the income tax on work, and the SEC rule on buybacks should be revoked. None of this will happen so long as money dominates our politics, so the Supreme Court decisions enabling that domination—Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo—should be undone, if not by Democratic-appointed successors to the current justices, then by other work-arounds, such as the current effort in Montana to rewrite the state’s corporate charters so they deny corporations the power to involve themselves in elections. Americans increasingly understand that our current economy isn’t meeting their interests and that it’s rigged to favor the wealthy. A sizable public will welcome candidates who expand the Overton window of economic reforms such as those suggested here, just as there were sizable publics that backed the reforms laid out by Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani in their campaigns. Indeed, a national YouGov poll taken one week after Mamdani’s election showed that every one of his platform planks commanded majority support from the American people, including 69 percent support for raising taxes on corporations and millionaires, 66 percent support for free child care for children from six months to five years, and even 57 percent support for government-owned grocery stores. There’s no reason why Democrats who don’t call themselves socialists can’t do well running on such reforms. This would be a very opportune time for them to start.

Title: Prices in the Machine

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Earlier this year, a slightly balding man in spectacles, a black T-shirt, and bright high-top sneakers gave a presentation about how his computer can predict what you want to buy. His name is Dr. Uri Yerushalmi, co-founder and chief artificial intelligence officer of Fetcherr, an Israeli-based pricing consultant used by a half dozen airlines around the world. “While most of us in the AI community have been focusing on building models that are generating either text or image, in Fetcherr we have been focusing during the last five years on building large market models,” Yerushalmi said. Trained on years of market data—prices, orders, competitors, regulation, stock prices, even the weather—Fetcherr’s “business agents” aim to simulate market dynamics, assist pricing analysts, and even automatically price tickets. More from David Dayen One presentation slide stuck out. It showed price fluctuations before the use of Fetcherr’s system and after. In the before graph, prices are relatively static and straight. After Fetcherr, the jagged lines pulse with staccato rhythms. “The dynamic is much more similar to dynamics in NASDAQ or capital markets where the prices change much more frequently,” said Yerushalmi, “because every time something in the market changes, there is an immediate response.” Yerushalmi once ran AI for a high-speed stock trading firm. He approaches pricing like a science experiment, engaging in constant real-time testing and tweaking to maximize corporate profits. Fetcherr boasts of delivering annual “revenue uplift” of over 10 percent. The guinea pigs for these tests, the ones being separated from their cash, are you and me. AI can depict you as an anime character. It can respond half-intelligently to questions about the Franco-Prussian War or concentrations of sulfur in the upper atmosphere. It can delight and distract and maybe help you get work done. But none of that is as prized by corporate America as its data-driven approach to the previously conjectural world of pricing. Supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. “That’s the use case they don’t want you to talk about. That’s why we’re building all these data centers,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project. “As we have built social media platforms that shape the flow of information across society, now we are building the platforms that control the flow of money.” Technology-fueled pricing is more widespread than once thought, presenting serious policy challenges in an age where affordability is on everyone’s minds. AI bots are colluding with one another, anticipating consumer choices, and accumulating surplus—that is, transferring wealth—for the businesses that employ them. It’s part of why corporate profits hit record highs after the pandemic and have stayed there. The public recoils at the thought of seeing prices tick up based on when they like to get lunch or what device they’re using. When Delta, which employs Fetcherr as a pricing agent, announced on an earnings call this summer that up to 20 percent of its flights would be priced using AI by the end of the year, the outcry was so intense that the company claimed its critics were peddling “misinformation.” Policymakers and advocates have united to crack down on some tactics, winning real legislative victories from coast to coast. But every step government takes can be countered by AI price-setters. How can consumers keep up? “What worries me is that it will become hyperefficient to price discriminate and to charge more in ways that ordinary people will not be able to combat,” said Doha Mekki, the top deputy at the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division under Joe Biden. “And it will make a very bad cost-of-living crisis even worse.” A YEAR AGO, I WROTE ABOUT WHAT I TERMED surveillance pricing: companies offering individualized prices based on personal data. The idea was that a business equipped with granular information about demographics, purchase history, social and financial interactions, or even medical status could exploit a customer’s willingness to pay. Uber could charge more when a rider booked on a company credit card; people aren’t as price-sensitive when someone else is paying. Delta could jack up fares after learning that a traveler needs to attend a funeral; desperation could translate into opportunity. I couldn’t be certain how many businesses used surveillance pricing. The proliferation of third-party pricing consultants touting “digital pricing transformations” seemed like a strong indicator. But concealment was key to the strategy, to minimize the anger generated by charging different prices to different people. For instance, when a reporter at SFGate logged in to hotel booking platforms using his regular IP address in high-wage San Francisco, he received a quote of $829 a night. But when he used a virtual private network set up to originate from Phoenix or Kansas City, prices were more than $500 less. Without a public price, it takes research to understand if someone is being ripped off. A month after my report, Lina Khan’s Federal Trade Commission announced an investigation into surveillance pricing, seeking information from eight third-party consultants. The agency only had a short time to conduct the study before the changeover of power in Washington. But days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, it issued “research summaries” of the work done thus far. (Trump’s FTC has yet to finish the study.) Stephanie Nguyen, the FTC’s chief technologist under Khan, told me those eight pricing consultants were working with over 250 clients, suggesting broad reach across the economy. Services included individually targeted pricing, segmentation of customers based on their profiles, and ranking tools that alter what products people see atop a web page or search. A customer clicking on fast shipping, for example, suggests an urgency that would lead them to tolerate higher prices. The key to surveillance pricing is data. Nguyen and Sam Levine, the FTC’s former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, recently wrote a paper about how customers deliver that data when they sign up for loyalty programs. Enticed by promised discounts and concierge treatment, customers consent to data collection that allows companies to build intricate social graphs; one customer profile created by the grocery chain Kroger stretched to 62 pages. The discounts often aren’t maintained or are curtailed, loyalty card fees expand over time, and the more loyal a customer, the more data is collected and the more they pay over time, according to the report. One case study is the McDonald’s app, which has 185 million users and provides seamless access on smartphones, our personal data-spewing machines. According to a recent earnings call, after downloading the app, a customer goes from 10.5 annual McDonald’s visits on average to 26. McDonald’s clearly wants its customers on the app. Its popular Monopoly game gives out stickers on the packaging of items like Big Macs and fries; you collect the right ones to win big prizes. But this year, instead of filling out a physical game board, Monopoly pieces now must be scanned into the app. “This is about taxing people who don’t turn over their data, and manipulating people who do,” Levine said. “Do we really want a world in which you will have to pay a premium if you want to shop anonymously?” Surveillance pricing is just one technology that companies use to set prices. Surge pricing accelerates supply and demand to raise prices when more people want the product or service. Subscription pricing offers products for a monthly fee, a steady stream of revenue from absent-minded customers that can feature deceptive sign-ups and impossible cancellation policies. Trump’s FTC sued Uber for a subscription service that takes as many as 23 screens and 32 actions to cancel; Amazon Prime’s cancellation policy, the subject of a separate FTC settlement that cost the company $2.5 billion, was internally nicknamed “Iliad Flow,” like the tortuous war Odysseus waged in the Greek epic. Electronic shelf tags at Walmart and other grocers have triggered fears of endlessly changing prices while you shop. FIFA has confirmed use of differential pricing for World Cup events based on demand, something New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has criticized. “They can become a tool for pure extraction and leave everybody paying what they shouldn’t,” said Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, which monitors event ticketing. One of the most insidious uses of technology is on the wage side. An issue brief from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth focused on how companies are using personal data to set worker pay, something first seen in the ride-hailing industry. Twenty AI consultants offer surveillance wage services to clients in logistics, manufacturing, retail, finance, education, transportation, technology, and health care, which is “the new Uber in a lot of ways,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California and co-author of the report. The AI systems can adjust worker pay in real time, and offer different wages to people doing the same work. They can adjust wages based on performance data, customer feedback, and even factors off the job, such as “predictive analytics that attempt to determine a worker’s potential tolerance for low pay,” the report notes. Most of these wage-setting practices are opaque to workers or their bargaining representatives. “This is becoming normalized,” Dubal said. “It fundamentally undermines the well-worn and very American idea that hard work should result in higher pay.” The result of these strategies is that supply and demand no longer solely determines price, as in textbook economics. AI-based pricing has become more critical than sale volume or product quality. Customers seeking a fair deal are simply outworked, unable to avoid being targeted. “There used to be moments where you really blew it, you had to buy a last-minute airline ticket and they’ve got you,” said Tim Wu, former competition policy chief in the Biden White House. “That’s really daily life now.” Consumers used to benefit from what economists would call imperfect information. The uncertainty of defining the optimal price, and the ability in open markets for new businesses to undercut competitors, gave consumers a fighting chance to get a deal, or just to manage their life without being tracked and prodded. Technology eliminates that information inefficiency. “What these technologies are about is eliminating all risk for the shareholder,” Hepner said. “There’s no more error. It is a well-oiled extraction machine.” EVEN ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN SURPRISED by the furiousness of the response to technology-aided pricing. As post-pandemic inflation swelled, AI trickery was a tangible, easy-to-understand depiction of an economy rigged against ordinary people, and the lack of transparency and unpredictability vexed consumers. “It was hiding in plain sight and everyone has found it and you just can’t unsee it,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. Politicians looking for anti-inflation messaging rode the wave of constituent anger. Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) challenged Delta’s palpable glee over surveillance pricing in an earnings call, and when Delta responded that they wouldn’t actually target customers using their personal data, Gallego didn’t let up. After all, Delta’s president Glen Hauenstein said on the earnings call that “to get [travelers] the right offer in your hand at the right time” is the “Holy Grail,” which sure sounds like surveillance pricing. “Delta is telling their investors one thing, and then turning around and telling the public another,” Gallego said in a statement. House Democrats proposed a bill to ban surveillance pricing and surveillance wage-setting. So-called “drip pricing,” where junk fees are added during a sale, was effectively banned in event ticketing and hotel stays by an FTC rule finalized in May. But with GOP control of Washington, the real action has moved to the states. Surveillance pricing bans were introduced in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota; surge pricing bans for grocery stores and restaurants were introduced in New York and Maine. By July, 24 states had seen bills introduced over some form of technology-aided pricing, according to a tracker from Consumer Reports. In a major win this year, the nation’s two largest blue states explicitly banned algorithmic price-fixing, a tactic famously used by RealPage, which aggregated data from landlords across a city and recommended coordinated rent hikes. Joe Biden’s Justice Department sued RealPage, reaching settlements with corporate landlords vowing to end the practice. But data aggregators like Agri Stats and PotatoTrac already do this for meat and produce, and states wanted to prevent tech-enabled collusion from expanding. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Advocates were pushing on an open door; housing is the biggest monthly expense people have. “When RealPage came out, it quickly mapped onto something people feel viscerally,” said Samantha Gordon, chief advocacy officer at TechEquity, which lobbied on the California tech pricing bills. Moreover, since price-fixing is illegal when human beings enter a smoke-filled room and collude, extending that to algorithmic collusion made sense to lawmakers. That was the concept behind California’s AB 325, which states that “common pricing algorithms,” whether informed through public or nonpublic competitor data, violate the Cartwright Act, California’s antitrust law. The law lowers the evidence standard to prove an algorithmic pricing conspiracy. It also prohibits anyone from distributing a pricing tool that coerces the setting of a recommended price, protecting small businesses along with consumers, explained Hepner, who was active in drafting the bill. “We saw mom-and-pop businesses swept up into these pricing schemes,” he said. “If you want to get the buy box on Amazon, you have to use their smart pricing tool. You have to give up independent decision-making authority to participate in the economy.” After seven rounds of amendments, AB 325 passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed it in October. Days later, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) signed S.7882, another prohibition on coordinated price-fixing via software, though limited to rental housing. The New York law also blocks landlords from using algorithms to set “lease renewal terms, ideal occupancy levels, or other lease terms and conditions.” Cities like Jersey City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Seattle have enacted similar citywide collusion bans, and 51 algorithmic price-fixing bills were introduced nationwide in just the 2025 legislative session. It’s “a potentially very powerful first step in tilting some of this economy back in favor of consumers,” Hepner said. The best way to get at surveillance pricing might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. Surveillance pricing bills have not seen the same success, though their failure revealed critical information. In California, AB 446, which would have banned pricing based on personal data, was held back, giving sponsors time to build support next year. That’s because businesses across the economy, even ones not suspected of surveillance pricing, swarmed Sacramento to defend their practices. “It was fascinating over the course of that legislative process to see the opposition come out and openly say, ‘Hey, we’re actually doing this, you mean we can’t do this anymore?’” Hepner told me. Some economists allege that tech pricing crackdowns threaten discounts and other potential benefits for consumers. But it’s hard to believe that companies would hire the most sophisticated engineers to figure out how to reduce their revenues. As Nguyen told me, the argument to preserve discounts boils down to this: “You can have privacy or low prices, but you can’t have both.” A modest breakthrough came in New York, which passed a disclosure law requiring that relevant transactions include a pop-up stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The National Retail Federation sued to block the law, but in October, a federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that the disclaimer “is plainly factual.” Advocates believe that the legal victory will give policymakers permission to revisit the topic. But the fierce pushback showed that AI-based pricing was no longer a speculative harm. “So many companies and industries trying to kill [surveillance pricing bans] told us everything we need to know on why everything is getting more and more expensive,” Gordon concluded. RealPage got the message as well. As the price-fixing bills worked their way through statehouses, the company announced it was acquiring Livble, a property management software tool. With Livble integrated into their platform, RealPage said, residents could subdivide rental payments into installments based on real-time cash flow landlords can see. In other words, RealPage was trying out surveillance pricing. THESE TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS FROM ONE SCHEME to the next make it difficult for policymakers to stay ahead of the curve. For example, Lyft, one of the early adopters of surge pricing, reacted to rider anger about the service being more expensive precisely when they needed it most by moving to something called Price Lock, a subscription-based pricing tool that caps fares on targeted routes—for a monthly fee. Another tactic involves redefining basic terms. When Delta claimed it would not use personal data, it added that it was merely “enhanc[ing] our existing fare pricing processes” with AI. “The lack of regulations about this and the way people’s data can be collected and used allows them to play around with what they are calling personal data and use,” said Ben Winters, director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. This forces policymakers to think more broadly, even on the outer edges of the possible. “I do worry that we’re always going to be chasing the companies,” said Sam Levine. “I think companies need to advertise a price publicly that’s available to all consumers … there should be a basic principle to advertise a price and it’s deceptive to charge more than that.” Levine’s testimony to Congress this summer hits on another option: limiting collection of personal data, rather than just its usage. “‘Surveillance pricing’ is only possible because of how companies collect, share, and weaponize our personal data,” he told lawmakers, while arguing that relying on outdated tools to safeguard privacy risked further abuse. Consumer protection and anti-monopoly experts are warming to this idea of cutting the data off at the source. Companies, after all, provide a full road map of what they collect in the privacy policies almost nobody reads. Levine and Nguyen’s loyalty program paper documents privacy policies, finding that rental car giant Hertz admits to collecting demographic and behavioral data, Home Depot tracks Wi-Fi usage inside their stores, and Macy’s captures customer driver’s licenses. Much of this data is sold to third-party data brokers, who share it with other businesses. A data minimization standard could prevent use of personal information for pricing, Winters suggested. Mekki added that antitrust law recognizes that antitrust remedies often call for disgorgement of whatever gives companies an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Applied to surveillance pricing, that would argue for destroying the data allowing them to price-set. “If you can be forced to give up money or property, it stands to reason that you need to give up data,” she said. The bipartisan American Privacy Rights Act introduced last year would have limited collection of certain kinds of data and given people the ability to opt out of having their data used to target them or sold to third parties. But this is at least the third major comprehensive privacy bill in the internet era that’s gone nowhere in Congress; too many companies are invested in the surveillance economy to let it be legislated out of existence. “This is a textbook example of people not getting what they want,” said Wu, whose recent book The Age of Extraction highlights Big Tech platform-ization multiplying across the economy. “Is there anyone in America who wants less privacy or thinks it’s fine, or really wants targeted ads? The constituency is zero … In 20 years of privacy laws, there hasn’t been a single vote. This is not even a conspiracy. The tech industry lobbyists specialize in one thing: killing privacy laws.” Some states have fared better, with a dozen passing limitations on data collection or letting consumers opt out of targeted ads or sale of personal data. California updated its policy this legislative session by passing AB 566, which allows internet users to opt out of data collection at the browser level, rather than having to go website by website. But practically all privacy legislation has carve-outs for “bona fide loyalty programs,” giving companies an escape hatch under the guise of offering discounts. Even given that, however, loyalty programs are not exempt from “excessive” collection under these statutes that is not reasonably necessary. Maryland recently finalized a privacy law that prevents companies from conditioning loyalty programs on the sale of data, despite industry pushback. The best way to get at this activity might not be to go after the data, but rather those who receive, share, and process it. That includes companies acting as data brokers by selling and trading data, and the third-party pricing consultants they share the data with. Data sales could be considered unfair or deceptive under state consumer protection laws. And even when customers consent to having their data collected, they may not be consenting to transferring that data to third parties. “State enforcers should be thinking, under what circumstances is it lawful for companies to share personal data with pricing consultants?” Levine said. Under Lina Khan, the FTC made headway by looking at these agglomerations of data as unfair practices, and subsequently prohibiting the sale of sensitive data, like when someone visits an abortion clinic. Today’s FTC has walked away from this enforcement, but their past work outlines a path for states to argue that targeted pricing is similarly unfair. AI PRICING WON’T LOOK THE SAME IN FIVE YEARS as it does now, but we have hints of where it’s going. That’s why the role of Fetcherr is more interesting than Delta’s meandering explanations for how it uses AI. Airlines have been at the forefront of every pricing innovation of the past 30 years, from junk fees to differential pricing to loyalty programs. What’s the next frontier? Fetcherr, which closed $90 million in funding in 2024 and another $42 million this year, tells you right on its website: “hyper-personalization at scale.” (Or at least, it used to tell you that, before it scrubbed this section.) “We’re talking about understanding each customer as an individual, optimizing every interaction for maximum value,” the now-redacted section states, detailing how its AI model uses data points like “customer lifetime value, past purchase behaviors, and the real-time context of each booking inquiry” to give each passenger their own product bundle at a bespoke price. The goal isn’t just a pleasant customer experience—it’s “revenue growth.” Robby Nissan, a Fetcherr co-founder, has said publicly that its AI systems can “manipulat[e] the market in order to gain more profit.” There’s not a lot of mystery here. There are other airline pricing consultants, like Peter Thiel–backed FLYR and PROS and Air Price IQ. But the pitch is the same: maximizing travelers’ willingness to pay by analyzing reams of data. If you want to see the dystopia of perfect information accurately predicting exactly how much you’ll pay for a service, just book a flight this Christmas. “It’s a very real example of how AI-based pricing schemes put consumers into economic silos,” Hepner said. “You cannot comparison shop anymore. You cannot predict what a price is supposed to be anymore.” This is facilitated by a concentrated economy where markets aren’t as open to alternatives to AI-optimized schemes. But AI pricing may shrink choice even further. For example, Delta recently stopped flying from LAX to London Heathrow Airport, despite the popularity of the route. Virgin Atlantic still makes the LAX-Heathrow trip; it’s a joint venture partner with Delta, and perhaps as important, both of them use Fetcherr. Was canceling the route an AI-enabled suggestion to benefit another client? We will never know. Large market models running millions of price tests with thousands of input signals could short-circuit restrictions on surveillance pricing or data minimization. If it’s all just simulations, after all, is it really using personal data? Another future is glimpsed in the rise of AI agents that shop for you. ChatGPT users will soon be able to link their PayPal accounts for instant purchases based on chatbot recommendations. Walmart has partnered with OpenAI for e-commerce as well. Autonomous bots with a linked bank account could even shop on their own, something a new AI agent lobby is trying to facilitate in Washington. There’s little transparency on how products are recommended, how prices are derived, or whether AI agents will act in the interest of consumers or the retailers they’re partnering with. “You’re delegating purchasing power to one algorithm to interface with another,” said Ben Winters. “You’re getting people signed up into these systems where they have no control.” But there’s also a brighter future possible, one where the backlash to nonstop data collection and pricing subterfuge accelerates, and people simply demand a fair price. Polling shows that the public is deeply skeptical that AI will work in their favor. Consumers may not have much control, but they do hold the dollars companies need to thrive, and they can withhold them from companies that treat them poorly. “I think it’s possible that this is headed back to cost-based pricing,” said Owens, whose book Gouged about the new era of pricing releases next year. “It’s the way companies priced for decades … There is a world where the outcome is transparent, public, predictable pricing.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: How Campbell’s leaked audio turned a pantry staple into a PR crisis

Time Published: 2025-12-01T12:17:05Z

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Just as families across the U.S. were heading into Thanksgiving weekend and stocking up on Campbell’s staples, a leaked audio recording landed online of a company vice president mocking Indian workers, calling customers “poor people,” and claiming its soups contained “bioengineered” or “3D” meat. The timing was combustible. A brand associated with holiday comfort was suddenly overshadowed by a senior leader’s contemptuous voice, directed at the very people who buy and make its products. Campbell confirmed the recording’s believed authenticity and removed the executive from his role. Several elements of the story emerged through a lawsuit filed by cybersecurity analyst Robert Garza, who alleges he told his manager about the comments in January, was discouraged from reporting them, and was later terminated. Campbell disputes that timeline, saying it first learned of the lawsuit months later and heard only “segments” of the audio on November 20. Regardless of how those details are adjudicated, once the recording went public, the question shifted from one executive’s conduct to the organization’s ability to confront issues before they escalate. These alleged events surfaced three essential truths about leadership that extend far beyond this single episode. The blowback was swift because Campbell is not merely a food manufacturer. Its products occupy a symbolic place on holiday tables, and the remarks felt like a direct insult to the households that rely on them. Consumers interpreted the comments as a reflection of how a leader with influence viewed the people who sustain the brand. Culture is judged in moments like this—not by corporate messaging but by private conduct that contradicts it. The allegations about internal handling reveal a more profound leadership truth: Trust within companies is fragile. Reporting systems work only when employees believe their concerns will be taken seriously rather than met with indifference or retaliation. When people think the organization is unwilling or unable to act, the crisis becomes bigger than the initial misconduct. The episode also highlights the modern fact that private comments are never entirely private. Power attracts scrutiny, and the tools to record unguarded moments are everywhere. The answer is to ensure that even one’s private behavior is consistent with the values the company claims to uphold. The final takeaway: What happened at Campbell ultimately reinforces why leadership is judged at its edges. The quiet moments and the offhand comments reveal far more about a leader’s integrity and C-suite readiness than any formal performance review ever could.

Title: DoorDash CEO Tony Xu outmaneuvered meal delivery rivals by obsessing over his customer

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:39:57Z

Good morning. If Americans treated their post-Thanksgiving Day exhaustion with take-out this weekend, there’s a good chance they ordered from DoorDash. The meal delivery giant now controls 60% of the market in the U.S and is more than twice the size of its closest competitor, Uber Eats. It wasn’t always that way. In a new Fortune feature, tech correspondent Jason Del Rey rode along with DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on a delivery run and got a front-seat look at how Xu built the scrappy upstart into an unexpected powerhouse in the cutthroat meal delivery industry. The startup founded in 2013 by Xu and three fellow Stanford students once had less than $30,000 left in its bank account. Now, thanks to grit, ingenuity, and a heaping serving of luck, it’s on track to generate more than $13 billion this year. Here a few lessons other leaders can learn from DoorDash and CEO Xu:Zig when others zag: Early on, DoorDash distinguished itself in the crowded meal delivery space by enlisting gig workers to pick up—and sometimes even order—food, whereas then-rivals Grubhub and Seamless only partnered with restaurants that had their own delivery drivers. Obsess over your customer: Xu prides himself on sweating the small stuff to improve service. For instance, DoorDash now highlights desserts on orders because they are the most likely to be forgotten. Its app also advises “Dashers” on where to park and which building entrance to use. Stay in touch with the front-line experience: Every corporate DoorDash employee in the U.S. must do four delivery shifts a year. On Jason’s ride-along, CEO Xu attempted to deliver four orders in San Francisco. He managed to drop off three and earned $19 for the hour’s worth of work. (DoorDash would top up that amount.) Xu’s hands-on experience stands out in a world in which the ultra-wealthy are living increasingly private lives. Strike when there’s blood: When Uber Eats’ parent was rehabilitating its culture and imposing financial discipline in the late 2010s, DoorDash went on a spending blitz. It poached several UberEats executives and expanded from 1,500 locations to 6,000, including into mid-tier cities and suburban towns that rivals had neglected. Be ready when opportunity hits: DoorDash’s investment in the suburbs paid off when the COVID pandemic pushed convenience-obsessed consumers out of cities and turned sit-down restaurants on to delivery. DoorDash’s business more than tripled in 2020. Jason cautions that DoorDash’s lead isn’t safe. It could “be displaced by a competitor like Uber—or an AI-native company that may not yet even exist.” But for now it’s won the meal delivery wars and is moving into new markets, like grocery delivery, where the battle for dominance may be just as fierce.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly the frontrunner for the job but declined to address whether he was the top candidate in an interview Sunday.

A Deloitte survey shows they plan to cut spending 34% this year, steeper than any other cohort. Only Gen Xers, aged 45 to 60, plan to spend more. Frozen salaries Major consulting firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group have frozen starting salaries for the third straight year as AI imposes more cautious hiring practices in the industry. AI is making junior employees more productive, putting downward pressure on their pay. Smartphone risks for kids A new study in the journal Pediatrics finds that children who had a smartphone by age 12 were at higher risk of depression, obesity, and inadequate sleep compared to their phoneless peers. The research included 10,500 kids in the U.S., making it the largest long-term look at children’s brain development in the country to date. AI job displacement An MIT study published last week found that nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce could already be replaced by AI systems. The report notably found that AI models can complete tasks in finance and health care, not just in technology or coding. Great Wealth Transfer won’t be a ‘big bang’ Northwestern Mutual CEO Tim Gerend told Fortune that the Great Wealth Transfer between Baby Boomers and younger generations won’t be a “big bang” like many expect but instead will come gradually. For young people who are “really anxious” about the economy, per Gerend, waiting for that inheritance only adds to their unease. S&P 500 futures are down 0.55% this morning.

Title: Sources of America’s Hidden Inflation

Time Published: 2025-12-01T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Prices have been rising across the economy in ways that are both visible and opaque. There are short-term drivers of inflation due to President Trump’s mismanagement of the economy. But the deeper drivers result from the degradation of capitalism. For example, the lethal combination of digital technology and tech monopolies picks your pocket in countless ways. Instead of technical advances leading to greater convenience and lower cost, as they logically should, they create strategies for opportunistic price hikes. More from Robert Kuttner When Amazon uses its deep knowledge of consumer preferences to rig markets and undermine competitors, higher prices are passed along. When HP makes it illegal or impossible for consumers to use cheaper non-HP cartridges in their printers, it can charge exorbitant prices. If you are prohibited from repairing your own car or your own iPhone, or as a farmer, prohibited from saving seed for next year’s planting, that invites monopoly profits built on higher prices. Costs rise because the rules are rigged. It isn’t just the increasing cost of health insurance, but the tax on your time when a health system of byzantine complexity requires you to waste hours to get a simple referral or get a claim paid. Middlemen and algorithms, both in the business of denying claims, are a direct cost to the system and a source of rising out-of-pocket prices to patients. If insurance doesn’t pay, you do. These middlemen also function as a drain on doctor time and thus a tax on doctors’ incomes, as well as a debasement of medical services In this special issue of the Prospect, we take stock of several hidden drivers of rising costs. David Dayen explores all the ways that technology allows sellers of any product that uses the internet to take advantage of surveillance capitalism to personalize prices and charge more than the market price that would be produced by ordinary supply and demand. It’s another case of monopoly pricing power, facilitated by invasive technology. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. As Emma Janssen writes, plutocracy is a driver of the affordability crisis. The top 10 percent of income earners now do close to half of the spending, by some estimates. This has led to “premiumization,” where airline seats, concert tickets, and even staple goods are priced for wealthier people because they are the primary buyers. That in turn drives prices higher for everyone else, as anyone who buys a ticket to a concert or a sporting event appreciates. Antitrust policy has thus far failed to curb obvious abuses by middlemen ticket sellers. Paul Starr writes in a sidebar that these trends invert the 20th-century pattern of affordable culture, beginning with nickel movie tickets and cheap bleacher seats. As the concert ticket example shows, middlemen are drivers of the affordability crisis. As Whitney Curry Wimbish writes, across the economy, from pharmaceuticals to real estate to meatpacking and more, middlemen sit in between suppliers and customers and squeeze out a layer of profit for themselves, taking advantage of their knowledge of industries and typically concentrated control of the supply chain. Regulatory capture, as James Baratta points out, is another source of price increases. Baratta’s focus is on electricity rates, and the failure of state public utility commissions to protect ratepayers from extractive price hikes based on dubious economic models used by utility companies. There is an even more subtle and insidious version of regulatory capture, in which regulations themselves are used to enforce industry’s anti-competitive strategies. As Cory Doctorow observes in his indispensable book Enshittification (reviewed in our October issue), far more sinister than traditional regulatory capture is regulatory fusion, in which industry designs laws and rules to thwart competition and raise profits. Using provisions of the industry-written 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Apple makes it a copyright violation for technicians to use non-Apple parts for most repairs to Apple products. The preposterous doctrine is that if an inferior non-Apple part caused the product to fail, that could reduce consumer confidence in Apple’s brand. There is even a name for this doctrine: tarnishment. TRUMP’S CONTRIBUTION TO RISING PRICES adds to these long-term abuses. Eric Winograd, a senior vice president at AllianceBernstein, calculates that Trump’s tariffs have added about one percentage point to the core inflation rate, though other estimates that account for Trump’s numerous exemptions of various products and industries put the number at 0.6 to 0.7 percent. But tariffs are only the beginning of Trump’s impact on prices. The remedy for opportunistic price hikes in so many sectors is the resurrection of antitrust. Internet innovators grew from purveyors of ingenuity and user convenience into extractive monopolies largely because antitrust enforcement ceased to exist from late in the Carter administration until Joe Biden’s appointments of some of the smartest students of abuses and their remedies: Lina Khan at the FTC, Jonathan Kanter at the Justice Department, Rohit Chopra at the CFPB, and Tim Wu (whose latest book is reviewed in these pages) as competition policy chief at the White House. These agencies had just gotten serious about reversing four decades of corporate market power when the antitrust revolution was reversed by Trump. As antitrust enforcement has been aborted, private equity companies have been buying up traditionally local firms in order to use market power to raise prices, in sectors as diverse as pest control operations, HVAC companies, and veterinary practices In addition, Trump’s shutting down of Biden’s industrial policies has raised prices. Electric power costs have lately risen far faster than the general rate of inflation. Trump’s policy of killing renewable-energy projects, in order to raise profits for oil and gas companies, contributes to this price rise, by taking away power that might otherwise come onto the grid and alleviate demand. So does the failure to regulate the extensive use of electric power by data centers used by tech companies. There was a time when we needed to shift to solar and wind in order to help address climate change. But now that renewables are cheaper than most fossil fuels, we need to make that shift because it saves money. Instead, Trump promotes more costly oil and gas. It is hard to quantify precisely how much all of Trump’s policies taken together have added to price inflation, but a very conservative estimate would be about two percentage points. That may not sound like a lot, but it is the difference between a baseline inflation rate of 2.5 percent and a rate of 4.5 percent. And that difference is not just a hidden tax on consumers. It has knock-on effects. With inflation at 2.5 percent, the Federal Reserve is willing to reduce interest rates in order to reduce unemployment. But when price increases approach 4 percent, the Fed worries more about inflation. At a time when unemployment rates are rising, policies that raise prices tie the Fed’s hands. This paradoxically could make things more unaffordable for low-income workers, if a loose job market keeps wages from rising. It’s not clear whether there will be any more rate cuts in the near future, and there may even be rate increases. A Fed policy of tighter money means that people pay more for their mortgage loans, their credit card debt, their student loans, and consumers pay more when small businesses pay more for credit. Trump’s cuts in programs such as SNAP and Medicaid are another form of indirect price hikes; even worse, they are price hikes that hit the poor. If your food stamp allotment is reduced, you have to pay more out of pocket in order to eat. If your Medicaid is cut, you pay out of pocket or do without. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The failure to address climate change, and Trump’s reversal of long-standing policies aimed at preserving the environment, also add to costs. As destructive storms become more severe and frequent, the costs of recovery and of homeowner insurance relentlessly rise, some borne by consumers directly and some by taxpayers. This natural-world aspect of hidden inflation is addressed in another of our special articles, by Gabrielle Gurley. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A DEBATE among economists and policymakers about whether the Consumer Price Index should be adjusted downward to reflect improvements in quality. A 2020 car was simply a better car than a 1980 car, so some of the nominal price inflation actually represented a superior product. Likewise coffee: In 1970, a cup of coffee only cost a dime, but the swill was undrinkable. Coffee today is a lot more expensive, but it is palatable. In practice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did some minor revisions to adjust for quality improvements. Today, we might need to do the reverse. We are paying more money for products and services whose quality has deteriorated. And in many cases, the deterioration has been deliberate. Indeed, the business model of the tech giants is to systematically degrade the quality of products and services. Products are needlessly complex from the perspective of the consumer, but the complexity adds to the surveillance. Same with tech services. This is the essence of what Doctorow calls enshittification. Doctorow tells the story of how Google deliberately slowed down its search process in order to make more time for its system to festoon the search results with annoying ads that embody everything that Google knows about the user’s buying habits. In conventional economics, wages and prices are two different aspects of the economy. But whether people can afford to live decently is a function of what they earn applied to what they have to pay to live. The same technology that allows tech monopolists to gouge consumers enables them to treat workers like serfs and evade the protections of labor law. As Harold Meyerson writes in his piece, the cost of living is higher because earnings are lower. And earnings are lower because of both the weakening of the labor movement and the sidelining of the National Labor Relations Board. In addition, tech allows employers to double down on the old practice of denying that workers are payroll employees protected by labor laws. From Uber drivers and UPS contractors to chicken farmers and fast-food workers, the company controls and monitors every aspect of the work, but the employer pretends that the workers are independent contractors. This represents a toxic marriage of app technology and market power. The effect is to batter down earnings. And as Naomi Bethune writes, all of the predations tend to hit racial and ethnic minorities harder, because African Americans and Latinos are more economically vulnerable to begin with. Trump’s war on DEI only increases the vulnerability. EVEN APART FROM THE PREDATIONS of extractive and invasive capitalism, other sources of the relentless rise in prices are the result of policy failures that predate the abuses of surveillance capitalism and Donald Trump by decades. Housing is out of reach for so many Americans because America has failed to build enough houses. Houses were cheap after World War II mainly because cheap farmland was being converted to suburbia, with the help of federal highway and mortgage policies. The cheap land is gone, and homebuilder consolidation has distorted markets. Trump’s tariffs have caused a rise in building costs, and his proposal to privatize the secondary mortgage market would make financing more expensive. Housing tax breaks are tilted toward more expensive homes, and toward homeowners over renters. The sheer purchasing power of the oligarchy also bids up prices. Local regulatory barriers also raise costs, but many zoning restrictions also reflect the political power of oligarchs, who don’t want riffraff in their neighborhoods. The bipartisan failure to regulate new financial scams such as subprime mortgages added to the pressure on housing. Millions of homeowners, disproportionately Black and Hispanic, lost their homes in the wake of the subprime collapse. Congress passed legislation to allow for mortgage refinancing for duped homeowners, but the Obama administration failed to carry it out. You might think that scads of vacant and foreclosed houses would lead to lower prices via the law of supply and demand. But the same regulatory failure led private equity companies to swoop in, buy houses, and jack up prices and rents, while making homebuilders reluctant to build the additional units we need. Public policy has also failed to produce an adequate supply of affordable rental housing. The rental housing that we do subsidize is done in wildly inefficient ways, for the convenience and profit of landlords and developers. Our failure to have a true social-housing sector reflects power imbalances between oligarchs and ordinary citizens. The cost of higher education is out of sight because legislators, Republican and Democrat alike, permitted universities to inflate costs via the student loan program, and then piled debt onto generations of students and graduates. State legislatures compounded the damage by reducing direct appropriations to public universities that were free to state residents until a generation ago, substituting tuition and fees. It now costs more to attend a state university than what a private university cost when I was a student. Health care costs also keep rising because the United States has failed to adopt an efficient program of universal public health insurance, as every other major country has done. To compound the damage, policymakers have allowed a plague of for-profit middlemen to take over hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors’ practices. In many hospitals, people of means hire private nurses because the hospital’s own nursing staff is so stretched thin and overworked by cost-cutting aimed at siphoning profits. A hidden price hike, if you can afford it. If the U.S. had a universal nonprofit insurance system, it would save about 6 percent of GDP. That’s $1.2 trillion a year. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE ABUSES of capitalism were relatively straightforward and transparent. Large corporations sought to combine into monopolies. The remedy was enactment and enforcement of antitrust laws. Corporations tried to pay their workers as little as possible and to break their unions. The remedy was the Wagner Act, guaranteeing workers the right to organize and join unions. Bankers tried to swindle investors for their own enrichment. The remedy was tougher banking and securities laws, prohibiting conflicts of interest. Corporations tried to cheat consumers with tricky terms and shoddy products. The remedy was the pro-consumer legislation of the 1960s and 1970s. But today’s corporate and financial abuses are hidden in a web of algorithms and apps, reinforced by regulations that actually help tech companies cheat consumers rather than protect them. It takes a complex, deeply knowledgeable, and radical critique of capitalism as currently practiced to get serious about remedies. That does not describe about half of the current Democratic Party, which is on the take from these same industries. One of the many tragedies of Joe Biden was that he was a feeble spokesman for his own good policies. He hired the most knowledgeable people in the country to revive antitrust and apply it to new abuses. But Biden did poorly at narrating the significance of these policies to ordinary Americans coping with rising prices. As I’ve written elsewhere, many of these policies and people reflected the work of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was a superb narrator of what they meant and why we needed them. But we ended up with the soul of Elizabeth Warren in the feckless persona of Joe Biden. If we can make the heroic assumption that Trump will not be president forever, and that there will be an opportunity to pick up where Biden and Warren left off, America’s next leaders will need to be even more radical in their understanding and remediation of capitalism, which has become even more debased since Trump took office.
