Caprize Investment, a smallcase manager expects a turnaround in the market by H2FY26.The current market correction/consolidation is likely to sustain as capital outflows continue over the next two quarters in absence of any new reforms. High-growth sectors with strong earnings visibility are likely to stabilize. As market estimates shift to FY27 post Q1 FY26 numbers, Caprize Investment- smallcase manager expects a turnaround post H2 FY26, with high-growth stocks looking attractively valued, setting the stage for the next earnings re-rating cycle. Liquidity and Valuation Trends Recovery in the market is dependent upon a major liquidity event. In past years, liquidity has indeed been plentiful; however, during the next two quarters, issues on this front will arise. Still, various high-growth stocks (25%+ year-on-year growth) are presently priced at 15-20x one-year forward multiples. When the market is consolidating, these multiple levels will begin looking more palatable on a FY27 base. Investment Themes Key Investment Themes and stock picks for 2025 include: Discretionary Consumption (Value Retail, Jewelry manufacturers, Mid/premium Hotels) : v2 Retail, Style Bazaar, Sky Gold, Samhi, and Kamat Ø Power (Transformers, transmission EPC) - TARIL, Shilchar, and Rajesh Power Ø Manufacturing/ Make in India: Garware Hitech and Vishnu Ø Renewables: INA, KPEL, and Shakti Pumps Ø Water Treatment: Ceinsystech The focus remains on Discretionary consumption, which comprises value retail, jewelry manufacturers, and mid-to-premium hotel chains. The power sector also takes center stage with a strong focus on transformers and transmission EPC projects. Also, niche manufacturing and Make-in-India will continue to gain advantage through government policies and domestic consumption. Renewables, driven by a robust backward integration theme, will offer selective investment opportunities. Data centers, too, will see sustainable growth levers due to enhanced digital infrastructure requirements. In addition, water treatment is gaining importance as the need for sustainable solutions and water infrastructure rises. Sectoral Performance: Bullish and Bearish Outlooks Sector-wise, some sectors are likely to lag behind because of numerous macroeconomic and sector- related issues. These are oil & gas, BFSI, auto, defense, railways, chemicals, consumer non-discretionary, and IT. On the other hand, discretionary consumption, power, manufacturing, renewables, data centers, and water treatment are likely to continue with growth and provide large-scale investment opportunities. Piyush Mehta, smallcase Manager and CIO at Caprize Investment says, “The changing market environment in 2025 holds challenges and opportunities alike. Short-term volatility can continue in the face of liquidity pressures and earnings normalization, but sectors like discretionary consumption, renewables, and niche manufacturing offer strong long-term potential. Strategic investors, prioritizing earnings clarity and valuation discipline, will be well equipped to ride out this fluid environment”. Strategic sectoral investments and long-term earnings growth remain as important as ever as we work through the risks of 2025. Macro-economic trends, liquidity levels, and shifts in valuation need to be watched very closely by investors to maximize portfolios in the new market environment.

Brigade (-3.03%), Phoenix Mills (-2.31%), Raymond (-2.12%), Lodha (-1.53%), Godrej Properties (-1.51%) How would you expect Asian stocks to fare in the immediate near-term? Are there signs of stability emerging for Asian equities after the selloff on Wall Street in recent days? The recent sell-off on Wall Street has affected Global Equity Markets as the fallout and threat of potential trade wars take hold. Markets do not like uncertainty and when there are dangers and unknowns surrounding market conditions, we often see a move to safer, less risky assets. Asian equities are not immune to this as we have seen weakness across Indices such as the ASX with its strong links to Chinese trade, and concerns over how any trade wars could affect Chinese demand. With that said, the Chinese A50 has been relatively stable and the Nikkei has stabilised in recent sessions, as there has been an attraction to Chinese tech stocks and a rotation from US equities into international markets, including Asian equities, to take advantage of growth prospects and potential shifts in geopolitical relations. Tech advancements in China and potential stimulus from the Chinese government to support the Chinese economy can help protect Asian equities. Whilst trade wars and tariffs will no doubt impact Global economies, it is in no one’s interest to see the trade wars escalate, and I am sure there will be attempts to ease tensions and mitigate the impact of any potential trade wars. We are seeing a shift in Global investment strategies as we see rotation out of US stocks into the international arena including Asia to take advantage of the growth potential outside of the US, and this could also help support a rebound in the Asian stock markets in the short-term. With that said, the sustainability of any short-term rebound will depend on the longer-term impacts of the factors outlined above and in the current environment things can change very quickly. Any escalation of trade wars can have an immediate and sharp impact on the markets. With the way that the US administration communicates, this can happen unexpectedly and at any moment, so we must always be aware and remain dynamic with our strategies.

CPI cooled off further to a 9 month-low of 3.6% in February 2025. Month-on-month CPI fell by 52 bps in February. This was the fourth consecutive drop registered by CPI. Core CPI however rose to 4.0% (from previous month’s 3.7%), but is still at the RBI’s median 4% target level. A moderation in food prices has been the primary driver of the fall in CPI. After peaking out in October 2024 at 9.69% (YoY), Food & Beverages CPI has been dropping sequentially. February F&B inflation came in at 3.84% YoY, which is a significant drop, and also much below CY24’s average level of 7.6%. Month-on-month, F&B inflation contracted 1.64% in February, after already falling 2.43% in January. A significant drop in vegetable prices was the primary reason for the moderation in F&B inflation. This is the lowest level of F&B inflation in 21 months. The sharp drop in CPI is certainly a welcome development, as it provides more leg room to the RBI MPC in monetary easing. RBI has pivoted in the February MPC meeting with a 25 bps rate cut and is now looking to revive growth of the Indian economy. In the backdrop of tight monetary policy and high interest rates over the past couple of years as well as the prevailing global (geopolitical and trade) uncertainties, India’s GDP growth had collapsed from 9.5% a year back (Q3FY24, YoY) to 5.6% in Q2FY25, before recovering slightly to 6.2% in Q3FY25. RBI’s own projection for the GDP in FY25 and FY26 is around 6.6-6.7%, which is much lower than the 9.2% annual growth that the economy registered in FY24. Of a total of 3,869 stocks traded on the BSE at 12 noon on March 13, 2025, 1,687 advanced against 2,031 stocks that declined, and 151 remained unchanged.

Data showed that the U.S. CPI increased less than expected last month reported at 2.8% against the previous month of 3%. However, backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the cost of most goods in the months ahead is keeping the overall inflation expectations higher in the market. President Trump early this month triggered a trade war, increasing tariffs on goods from China to 20% and imposing a new 25% duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, before dialing back and providing a one-month exemption for some goods that meet the rules of origin under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Trump also reversed course on a pledge to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, hours after announcing the higher tariffs. Along with possible change in rate cut expectations, market participants will also keep an eye on US PPI data scheduled later today. Track IndusInd Bank stock price News & Updates here CPI inflation being at a 7-month low along with food inflation at its lowest since May 2023 together is a strong indicator of easing inflation and supply-side constraints getting addressed. This will help the RBI ease the rates further in the April policy meeting. A rate cut combined with ongoing liquidity measures will help boost system liquidity, thereby, leading to a pick-up in credit and consumption growth. Parallelly, this will bring much-needed relief to the food services sector with the lowered cost of raw materials and natural produce. Having said that, the need for an organised ecosystem to boost credit flow along with the integration of technology and AI into the agricultural sector is the need of the hour. Last but not least, we hope the rupee maintains its value so we don’t see inflation in oils and pulses.

It continues to trade within the 22,330-22,620 range, and a breakout in either directions will likely determine its next move. Based on GIFT Nifty trend, Indian markets are expected to start the day on a positive note, with favorable economic data, including CPI and IIP, likely to drive the Index higher. In the case of BankNifty, after a brief dip below its strong support of 47,900, it bounced back sharply. We anticipate this upward momentum to continue towards 48,500, with 47,900 still acting as a solid support level. Tata Motors from the Auto sector remains a consistent recommendation, and another stock, Bharat Forge, is poised to break out from an Inverted Head and Shoulder Formation. In the FMCG space, Sugar stocks have gained traction, with Balrampur Chini breaking out from a Symmetrical Triangle Formation, and United Spirits is on the verge of a breakout from a similar formation.

The CPI inflation declined sharper than expected to a seven-month low 3.6% in February 2025 from 4.3% in January 2025, appreciably below the mid-point of the MPC’s medium term target range, led by a welcome cooling in food inflation. However, we believe that the sequential uptick in vegetables inflation in March 2025 is likely to prevent a further softening in the food and beverages inflation print in the month, after the substantial cooling seen over the past four months. This would push up the CPI inflation print mildly to ~3.9-4.0% in the next month. Overall, the CPI inflation is now expected to average at 3.9% in Q4 FY2025, well below the MPC’s projection of 4.4% for that quarter. The Feb 2025 CPI inflation print falling well below 4% has cemented the expectation of a back-to-back 25 bps rate cut in the April 2025 MPC meeting. This may be followed by another 25 bps repo rate cut either in the June 2025 or the August 2025 meetings, dependant in large part on the next GDP growth print for Q4 FY2025. Nevertheless, we are apprehensive that tight liquidity conditions may delay transmission of policy rate cuts to bank deposit and lending rates. IIP IIP growth improved to a higher than expected 5.0% in January 2025, led by manufacturing and mining. The use-based data is less enthusing, with a sequential YoY pickup seen in only two segments (consumer non-durables and primary goods) amidst a slowdown in the other four. Reflecting the base effect related to the leap year in 2024, the YoY performance of most of the available high frequency indicators deteriorated in February 2025 vis-à-vis January 2025. ICRA expects the IIP expansion to moderate to ~3.0-4.0% in February 2025 (+5.6% in February 2024) from 5.0% in January 2025 (+4.2% in January 2024). It’s good news on both fronts; the CPI inflation has eased much lower than the 4%. The retail inflation has eased to a 7-month low at 3.61% vs 4.31% in January. The latest inflation print is also important as it shows that the decline in inflation has been durable. What is also good to read is the core inflation print at 4% and the most important Food inflation at 3.75%. Food inflation has remained sticky due to seasonality. On the industrial production front, the January IIP data stood at 5% vs 3.2% in December. The manufacturing output at 5.5% is encouraging as it reflects the upbeat mood at the factory level. Overall, the latest data sets the event for an April rate cut. The RBI had indicated that their future moves will be data-driven. Geopolitical tensions and a spike in crude prices and trade tariffs remain key risk factors. “Festive Cheer Boosts IIP Nov Growth to 5.2% Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024. This decline strengthens the case for further monetary easing, as inflation now aligns with the RBI’s medium-term target. The sharp 222 bps decline in food inflation (to 3.75%) was the primary disinflationary force, the lowest since May 2023. Within food, vegetable prices contracted by -1.07% YoY (down from +11.35% in January) due to Kharif crops coming into the market, while pulses inflation turned negative (-0.35%), amid rabi harvest expectations. Fuel & light inflation remained in deflationary territory (-1.33%). While overall disinflation is evident, core inflation (ex-food & fuel) edged up to ~4%, suggesting persistent price pressures in certain segments. The biggest driver here was gold prices, surging 35.56% YoY, alongside rising health (4.12%) and transport (2.87%) inflation. With inflation now below the RBI’s 4% target median, another 25 bps rate cut in April is nearly certain, with a potential cumulative 50-75 bps easing by August 2025. However, global uncertainties loom—protectionist trade measures, commodity price volatility, and climate-linked food supply risks could disrupt the disinflationary momentum. The RBI must navigate this narrow policy corridor between supporting growth amid a negative output gap and preempting inflation volatility. This CPI print provides breathing space for monetary policy, but the next leg of inflation management will require precision, flexibility, and data-dependent recalibration rather than a one-way easing bias.” Headline inflation for February moderated to a seven-month low of 3.61% YoY, primarily due to easing food prices (-2% MoM), especially for vegetables, eggs, and pulses. Core inflation ticked up further, however, to a 16-month high of 4.2% YoY, mainly owing to higher gold prices. March CPI is tracking ~3.8% so far with food prices staying largely subdued. Core inflation is expected at ~3.6% in FY25E but is likely to be over 4% for the coming months, while we see FY25E headline inflation at ~4.7%. For FY26E, headline inflation is estimated at 4.3-4.4% (core: ~4.2%). A significant undershoot (40-50bps) in CPI for Q4FY25 will keep an April rate cut in play. However, global dynamics remain volatile, with their effect on FX to be watched. Inflation Below 4%: RBI Easing Imminent, But Risks Remain “India’s retail inflation softened to 3.61% in February 2025, a significant 65 bps decline from January’s 4.26%, marking the first dip below the 4% threshold since August 2024.

This CPI print provides breathing space for monetary policy, but the next leg of inflation management will require precision, flexibility, and data-dependent recalibration rather than a one-way easing bias.” “CPI fell to 3.61% in February 2025, reaching a seven-month low. This figure was below economists’ expectations of 3.85% and lower than the 4.26% reported in January 2025. The decline in CPI is due to a moderation in consumer food price inflation, which decreased from 6.02% in January to 3.75% in February 2025. The favourable harvest season is expected to further support this moderation in inflation. With inflation now around the target, this reading should strengthen the case for another rate cut at the upcoming RBI MPC meeting, as the focus is likely to shift towards boosting economic growth.” Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has launched the Bajaj Allianz Life Focused 25 Fund, a new ULIP-linked fund designed for long-term capital appreciation through a concentrated portfolio of up to 25 high-growth potential stocks, primarily in large caps. The fund, benchmarked against the Nifty 100 Index, follows a high-conviction, research-backed strategy to invest in fundamentally strong businesses with sustainable growth. The NFO closes on March 20, 2025. We are seeing a sharp and swift unwinding of the excesses and froth in the market which was built in FY24 and Q1-FY25. Valuations in certain pockets were factoring heightened earnings expectations, especially the cyclical portion of the market was being built for the long-term, which is seeing correction as earnings are getting normalised. We are seeing earnings cuts as well for the broader markets and hence a sharp fall where-in earnings are not measuring up to expectations. We are also seeing a period where in FPIs have been consistent sellers and there is heightened volatility due to global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Government spends and recovery in capex, interest rate cuts, recovery in consumption post tax breaks are key factors to watch out for. We reckon, amidst a growth slowdown, it is imperative to stick to investments that offer a structural long-term growth trajectory. Companies having good return profiles, good managements, healthy capital allocation capabilities and ability to capture the growth should be the preferred ones. We believe, India’s long-term growth story is still very much intact which can be very well played through the equity markets, though avoiding pockets of overvaluation and overestimation of earnings. The domestic markets are expected to open on a positive note on Thursday, as the domestic macro economic numbers were sprang positive numbers. Positive global cues will also aid market sentiment, said analysts. According to them, the consolidation phase will continue given the strong support at lower levels. Gift Nifty 22,555 signals a marginal gain. Analysts expect low-volume trading and profit-booking in the latter part of the day due to a holiday tomorrow on account of Holi. Retail participation will also be lower given the long weekend, they observed. Positive domestic and global cues boost market sentiment, with analysts predicting continued consolidation and low-volume trading. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation moderated sharply to 3.6% in February 2025, below market expectations of 4% and down from 4.3% in January 2025. The decline was primarily driven by easing food inflation, with vegetable prices turning negative for the first time in 20 months. With inflation trending lower than anticipated, the average CPI for the quarter is now expected to fall below the RBI’s initial projection of 4.4%. Easing food prices, coupled with lower global crude oil prices, have provided a supportive backdrop for inflation to align more closely with the RBI’s 4% target.Against this backdrop, the RBI, which recently cut the repo rate by 25 basis points and implemented liquidity measures to address the system’s deficit, is likely to maintain its easing cycle. The central bank’s stance is influenced by growing concerns over the economic growth outlook, given rising global trade uncertainties and the increasing prevalence of protectionist policies.

Title: Is Tesla cooked?

The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. The CEO is absent, the stock is plummeting, and the brand is toxic. Tesla’s future looks grim. by Andrew J. Hawkins If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. “I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???” But it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems. Trump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. The wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.) What happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. In California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. And it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. In China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. And unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles. A frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.) The Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. Meanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. While Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. For years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen. Musk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. Americans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. Musk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. Meanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs. Of course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.” Musk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.” But while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. There’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. And then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. Musk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. And even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. Separately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. Keep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. It’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. But that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. A lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.

Title: AI’s Future: Not Always Bigger

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human workâand none of these estimates include the cost of human laborâbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic âblitzscalingâ: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, itâs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, âThatâs nothing.â) Weâve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little thatâs concrete about OpenAIâs finances, everything weâve seen suggests that theyâre far from profitable2âa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAIâs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the USâs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I donât want to rush to the conclusion that it isnât necessary or advisable. But thatâs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. Thatâs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. Itâs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaireâs toy for achieving science fictionâs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work thatâs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of theseâand other cloud providersâare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we donât know how to answer yetâand probably wonât until weâre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although itâs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollarsâand possibly much lessâthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure thatâs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure thatâs needed will allow us to build a future thatâs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruptionâno doubt disruption thatâs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but thatâs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that weâll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencionâs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of âgarage AIâ startups, startups that arenât dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and âengagementââa process that, weâve seen, inevitably results in enshittificationâwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AIâs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining âalready hereâ¦just not unevenly distributed yet.â The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does ârelentlessly pro-humanâ mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of âgeneral intelligence.â Iâve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence isâthey’ve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isnât a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isnât a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedolâupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesnât fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machinesâat least in 2025âis that humans can want to do something. Machines canât. AlphaGo doesnât want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesnât want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; thatâs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, âI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.â You may not want to be there, but thatâs where creation startsâand creation is the reward. Thatâs why Iâm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, âItâs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people donât enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.â Donât get me wrongâSunoâs product is impressive, and Iâm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people donât enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didnât want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldnât have to say, âDonât quit the day job,â or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poetsâany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a âmoatâ that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. Weâre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for ârelentlessly pro-humanâ AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesnât matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what ârelentlessly humanâ might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isnât the lines of code that they produce; itâs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We wonât have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they wonât want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solveâthatâs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, weâre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is âslouching towards Bethlehemâ? We donât know, but there are some conclusions that we canât avoid: While there are many challenges to overcomeâlatency being the greatest of themâsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get ârelentlessly humanâ applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? Weâre about to find out.

Title: How To Create A More Agile Business For The Trump Era
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/03/10/how-to-create-a-more-agile-business-for-the-trump-era/

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff. It’s no secret that President Donald Trump’s economic policies have made uncertainty the theme of business in 2025 so far. His chaotic approach to tariffs—announcing them as coming, delayed and then imposed, sometimes with just days’ notice, has set most businesses on edge. Last month, financial health analytics company RapidRatings found that nearly seven in 10 supply chain professionals expect risks to escalate this year. Even before potential tariffs were looming, 81% of respondents said they had experienced supply chain disruptions in the last 24 months. Nearly a third of all of those disruptions cost more than $5 million, the survey found. A blog post from RapidRatings Executive Chair James Gellert brings the tariff threat into more acute focus. The post considers the possibility of a 25% tariff on China, Canada, Mexico and Germany, and finds it would significantly increase the risk faced by 25% of all public companies and 39% of all private companies. The whiplash of Trump-era tariff threats makes these impacts more significant. Companies and countries don’t know if announced tariffs will stand and effective dates will continue. Last week, a new round of tariffs took effect on Tuesday—25% on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on goods from China, adding up to 20%. On Wednesday, Trump decided to exempt Canadian and Mexican tariffs for U.S. automakers. On Thursday, Trump extended that monthlong pause on Canadian and Mexican tariffs to all goods covered by current trade agreements. But on Friday, he once again threatened tariffs on Canada—this time reciprocal tariffs on lumber and dairy products. This week promises more tariff headaches: 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports go into effect on Wednesday. Policies like this are wide-reaching and make planning difficult for companies. They’ve also sunk the stock market, with last week being the worst in six months. On a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump downplayed the market drop but didn’t deny the policies could result in a recession, saying that there will be “a period of transition,” and in the end it will end “great for us.” Figuring out what to do in the current situation is a huge challenge for businesses in many sectors. I talked to Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning company Coupa, about how to get a plan together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. People demonstrate during a protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite National Park. More jobs were cut in February than any other month since July 2020, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray& Christmas. Nationwide, there were roughly 172,000 job cuts last month. As far as February goes, last month’s cuts were the largest since 2009 during the midst of the Great Recession. More than a third of these cuts were in federal government positions, part of Elon Musk’s cost-slashing actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. These speedy and seemingly arbitrary and unfocused cuts have not just impacted federal government workers; CEOs of companies working with the federal government have started to talk about uncertainty caused by these cuts in their quarterly reports, the Washington Post reports. But the government isn’t the only sector seeing deep cuts. Retail is also seeing them, with the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showing 45,375 job cuts announced in the first two months of the year—an increase of 572% over the first two months of 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. According to Labor Department data released last week, the unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in February, though its timing doesn’t necessarily capture the full extent of government job cuts. However, the U.S. added just 151,000 non-farm jobs last month, the weakest February growth since 2019 and missing economists’ forecasts of 170,000 new jobs. A Target store in Novato, California. Target reported soft earnings last week, with declines in net sales, gross margins and earnings, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Compared with the same period last year, sales were down 3.1% and operating income dropped 21.3%. In its earnings report, Target warned of “meaningful year-over-year profit pressure” in the current quarter due to uncertainty—both among consumers and on tariffs. In an interview with CNBC last week, Target CEO Brian Cornell said that produce prices are likely to tick upwards within days of tariff enactment. As its sales and stock price are slipping, Cornell and his senior executive team hosted a meeting last week to discuss a comeback strategy for the retailer, Danziger reported. The retailer is striving to get back to its “Tarzhay” image—a term coined decades ago when it was perceived to be a store that made the everyday elevated and upscale. Target plans to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion in its stores, supply chain and technology over the next five years, with the planned outcome of $15 billion in sales growth. The company plans to invest more in its Good & Gather and Favorite Day private label brands, continue to grow its beauty section, reduce lead times for its home and apparel merchandise, expand partnerships with popular clothing and accessories brands, and enhance omnichannel shopping with AI recommendations and optimized search results. Aside from those investments, however, Target faces a distinct political challenge. In 2023, the retailer went all in on Pride Month-themed merchandise, a polarizing choice in some areas, which brought the store’s corporate reputation score down. Dialing back the merchandise assortment last year didn’t help matters much. As 2025 began and the Trump Administration began cracking down on diversity measures in the government, Target dialed down its diversity, equity and inclusion goals, sending its reputational score down again. The retailer was singled out as part of the February 28 People Union USA Economic Blackout—during which visits to physical stores were down 11% and app usage dropped 14%. A group of Black faith leaders is urging a 40-day boycott of the retailer to coincide with Lent. A New York City Walgreens store. Following years of store closings, falling stock prices and challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance is being taken private by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a roughly $10 billion, writes Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen. The company’s Walgreens and Boots stores will continue to operate, the companies said. Many of the company’s issues stemmed from its rollout of VillageMD clinics, a physician-staffed operator in which Walgreens had a controlling stake. A lack of patients for the clinics led to huge net losses. Japsen writes that VillageMD was the primary reason for losing over $8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The transaction is expected to close at the end of this year. Leagh Turner, Coupa CEO. President Donald Trump’s trade policies and announcements about tariffs have been wreaking havoc worldwide among leaders in both governments and businesses. Companies are working to make the best decisions for their bottom lines, investors and consumers in an environment where conditions are quickly changing. I spoke with Leagh Turner, CEO of supply chain and transaction planning software platform Coupa, about how businesses can plan for tariff uncertainty, both now and in the future. Our conversation took place in early March when 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico—both now suspended for a month—first took effect. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What are new tariffs doing to companies? Turner: Companies are going to have to change. Are people ready for nationalism versus globalism? Are they ready for trade to be increasingly based on proximity? New trade partnerships? Goods flowing in different ways and are they ready to optimize for that? If the market’s going to win, companies need to try and find a way to deal with those things quickly and to optimize. How agile are companies? Are they thinking about these things? Do they have the technology to be able to do it? Are people in the right positions thinking about it? Is technology ready to be able to support this? The answer is: To varying degrees but by and large, yes. It’s going to feel like a belt-tightening and a process reinforcement period. And that’s OK, because let’s be honest, If you’re a large global financial institution, you should be spending within appropriate limits. You should have guardrails in place that allow for people to do those things right in the day-to-day. That’s just good practice. It’ll give them more working capital, more cash in hand. It will allow them to be a little bit more resilient to these tariffs or changing policies and allow them to think about what they do next. Once you get the basics, planning is super important. Who do or could I buy from? What would that do to the way that I flow goods into my company? What scenario of all the available scenarios is optional or optimal to me? What does it do to my P&L, and what choices do I make when those become constrained? We’re not done; we’ve put up trade barriers between all countries and the Americas. But there will be a global reverberation. It’s going to be this really interesting elastic effect for a long period of time that people need to insulate themselves from. You get the basics. You drive up your working capital and cash on hand. You do some really good scenario planning. Technology can help you do that. Here’s the awesome thing: The last time we had to go through anything of this order of magnitude, we didn’t have monster data stores and real access to clean data. AI is upon us and we should be leveraging it to help us make good decisions. How should companies be planning for short-term versus long-term? First, accept the reality: We’re just getting started. The second is: Go grab the low-hanging fruit. Pressure is an opportunity to get better. If a business has been operating with loose controls and has been allowing creativity to be deployed against uncreative things, then stop. We have this measure that we use in our business: the amount of spend that you have under management, meaning how much of your spending is controlled. One of the companies that I spoke to over the course of the last week has 3% of their global spending under control, which means that 97% of their spending is not controlled. It’s based on the person who’s doing the spending. In 2025, it precludes you from being agile and from being able to cope with the current circumstances. Once you face the truth that we’re just at the beginning, to get really disciplined. Technology companies have a massive responsibility right now to say that which can be known is known. Instead of bearing down, look up. Scenario plan, leverage the mass deployment of AI to be able to make decisions that you could never have made absent that technology, and create a business that is far more agile than it was prior. Let me say more optimistically that maybe this is just a correction. Maybe this is just an opportunity for everybody, like the great financial crisis, to get better for those who are really diligent and rigorous. And for the cream to rise to the top. At an investor conference last week, streaming giant Netflix announced it would increase its spending on original content in 2025. 11%: Year-over-year increase in content spending, which adds up to a planned $18 billion 301 million: Netflix subscribers, as of its most recent earnings report ‘We do expect the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown to slow’: MoffettNathanson analysts wrote in a research note last week about Netflix, which led the company’s stock to drop more than 8% One of the most effective ways to improve your company is putting your employees at the center. And the best way to do that is simple: Prioritizing their well-being. Generative AI can bring positive results to your business in efficiency, creativity, employee satisfaction and consumer experience. But to make it work for you, you need to be able to scale it.

Mountain View By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Hey, guys. So I’m noticing egg prices are still super high and the stock market has been dropping kind of fast and inflation is up and thousands of federal workers are getting laid off. But you know what? In moments like this, I find solace in one thing: The billionaires are going to be just fine. President Donald Trump did say that he’d fix high food prices on Day 1 , and that everything was going to get better immediately. And now he and other people in his administration are using words like “ pain ,” “ disturbance ” and “ detox period .” I don’t really like those words, but I don’t think they will impact important people like Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, who all stood behind Trump during his inauguration when he said : “The Golden Age of America begins right now.” I guess “right now” isn’t exactly “right now” for us, but perhaps the billionaires get to enter the Golden Age first, which seems only fair. Opinion: Tariffs? Not on that! (Yet.) You're fired! Oops, you're rehired. Trump is all chaos. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about Trump’s recent tariffs and the trade war they’ve launched and said: “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” I wondered for a moment if he had ever visited America, but then I realized he was probably talking about billionaires who historically have not had to worry about cheap goods, unless a sharply discounted private island counts as one. So while I, personally, am in favor of cheap goods, as they allow me to spend less money to continue living, I totally understand why the American dream of the wealthy will be unfazed by tariffs. Prices are bound to increase for U.S. consumers , but the rich can endure a Wagyu beef bump just fine, and the rest of us already know how to stretch a box of mac and cheese out over several days anyway. That brings me comfort as I travel to the grocery store to purchase one egg with my weekly wages. Bessent then told CNBC on Friday that all the things Trump and Musk are doing to the federal government – which appears to be mainly firing people and flipping the “TARIFFS” switch on and off over and over again – might put the economy through a “ detox period .” “There’s an adjustment,” The Treasury chief said . “We’ll see whether there’s pain.” OK. My preference would be for there to not be pain, but I do rest easy knowing that Bessent, who according to The New York Times has assets and investments “worth in excess of $700 million,” will not feel that pain the same way you or I might. I simply hate it when stratospherically rich people feel pain. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday told Fox News that regular Americans shouldn’t worry about things like price increases or the S&P 500 having its worst week in months : “We're transitioning from Bidenomics and the terrible economy that was delivered by the last administration. It takes a while to turn that ship around.” You see, transitioning from 50 straight months of job growth , the second best market returns for a presidential term since 1945 and factory construction hitting its highest point in over 50 years is going to take some time. President Joe Biden had to fix the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, so it only makes sense Republicans and their billionaire assistants will need time to take it apart and make it work better for them. A Times headline Friday read: “Trump’s Policies Have Shaken a Once-Solid Economic Outlook.” Per that story: “Measures of business and consumer confidence have plunged. The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride. Layoffs are picking up, according to some data . And forecasters are cutting their estimates for economic growth this year, with some even predicting that the U.S. gross domestic product could shrink in the first quarter. "Some commentators have gone further, arguing that the economy could be headed for a recession.” Opinion: Trump's speech was all about dodging responsibility for the economy he's crashing Now it might sound bad when you put all those words in one place, but remember, if you’re a billionaire, everything’s probably going to work out great. For the rest of us, there will apparently be some pain, some disturbance and some detoxing. But I imagine we deserve that for not being uber-rich. Rather than look at my glass as half-empty, I prefer to look at the glasses of billionaires as overflowing onto the floor, and then being mopped up by servants whose glasses are all-the-way empty.

What we need to focus on as we stand in the unemployment line or put off retirement for a few years or trade our least-productive child for a carton of expired eggs is that Musk and Bezos and Zuckerberg and Trump are on solid footing with nothing to worry about. Don’t be discouraged by our current Golden Age. I’m sure the billionaires the president is helping get billionaire-ier are living their best lives on our behalf, and they’ll welcome us in soon, or possibly never.
