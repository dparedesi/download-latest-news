Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.” OK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. Speaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter.

Title: The AI revolution's next casualty could be the gig economy

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents. The shift represents a massive threat to AWS, which holds a firm grip on the lucrative startup ecosystem. More on Cloud 2.0.

Title: 'Deploying More Capital — Steady Lads': Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggle to Halt Plunge
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/18/deploying-more-capital-steady-lads-bitcoin-treasury-companies-struggle-to-halt-crash

Is crypto winter coming? It's already more than set in for bitcoin treasury companies (BTCTC). Aiming to replicate the once-in-a-generation success of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) and perhaps taking advantage of a U.S. regulatory regime that is willing to look the other way at questionable public offerings, a wave of crypto asset treasury companies have gone public in 2025. The result has been massive investor losses nearly across the board. And while the plunge in the price of bitcoin BTC$110,317.97 over the past 11 days (yes, it was only Monday, Oct. 3 when BTC peaked above $126,000) can be blamed for some of the carnage, BTCTC share prices were tumbling well prior to that. Checking a small group of BTCTCs, losses over the past three months range from "just" 38% in the case of Strategy to 94% for KindlyMD (NAKA). As his TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin began de-pegging from the dollar in May 2022, Do Kwon famously tweeted, "Deploying more capital — steady lads." Within days, TerraUSD, which had previously commanded a market cap of about $50 billion, was worthless. That social media post has gone on to become a meme for the crypto community whenever things start to look questionable for the markets or any companies. This isn't to suggest any level of comparable shiftiness or criminality, or to predict the future BTCTCs, but some of the executive teams at these firms have recently been uber-busy on social networks in defense of their business models. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Japan's Metaplanet (MTPLF) — which remains higher since it adopted the BTCTC strategy in 2024, but has had a 70% share price decline over the past three months — on Friday attempted to make the case for why a shift to preferred stock issuance will deliver strong returns to shareholders. "When bitcoin appreciates faster than the cost of capital, that difference compounds into greater bitcoin per share and the benefit accrues to the common shareholders," he said in a post on X. The tl;dr: Metaplanet investors will benefit if "number go up." KindlyMD CEO David Bailey — whose 94% share plunge over the past three months has left the stock price below $1 and in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq — on Thursday found it necessary to deny the claims of an X poster that his company had "FTX vibes." "In no way is there any similarity to FTX," said Bailey. "We’re a regulated, registered security that buys and holds bitcoin." When the CEO of publicly traded company has to respond to a random s--tposter to say "we're not FTX," it's safe to say the plot may have been lost. Then there was Strive (ASST) CIO Ben Werkman — whose share price plunge has nearly matched that of NAKA and also faces delisting danger — attempting to explain the difficulties and a way forward. "Now the exuberance is gone, and many companies are now in position with their balance sheets intact to be able to move to the second phase of the journey," said Werkman in an extremely long post to X. "Achieving scale is difficult, but now many companies have it," he continued. "Valuations are reaching what I would consider deep value territory (just based on balance sheets alone), and these are the valuations where many investors will place their bets for the long term." Werkman went on to remind that many assumed Saylor's Strategy (then MicroStrategy) was going to zero in 2022's crypto winter. Those who faded that assumption were rewarded with mind-boggling returns. MSTR was trading at about $30 when Do Kwon made his "steady lads" post. Even after their recent decline, the shares are still at $290 — or nearly a 10-bagger over the last three and a half years. Whatever the future may hold for the BTCTCs, one thing is for sure: the vibes are anything but positive at the moment. If any of the latecomers are going to mirror the massive success of first mover Strategy, it could require a lot more than just a rising bitcoin price.
