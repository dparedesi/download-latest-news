ByAntonio Pequeño IV, Forbes Staff. Lyft shares rose as high as 14% Wednesday to a three-year high after the rideshare company announced a partnership with autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo. Lyft shares traded up 12.8% to $22.60 about 20 minutes before market close Wednesday. The surge in share price brings Lyft’s stock to its highest point since May 2022, when it dramatically fell from a post-COVID lockdown boom the year prior. The Lyft and Waymo partnership brings Waymo’s robotaxi service to Nashville, adding on to the company’s service in the cities of Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta and Austin. Lyft will provide vehicle maintenance, infrastructure and depot operations under the agreement. Riders will be able to use Waymo’s robotaxi service first through the company’s app and later through Lyft’s app as the Nashville service grows.

Shares of Uber, Lyft’s ridesharing competitor, fell 4.2% at 2:30 p.m. EDT, erasing gains made in the last week of trading. Uber’s stock is up more than 53% this year. Lyft’s stock has been on a tear since the company announced its second quarter earnings in August, when it missed analyst expectations on revenue ($1.6 billion) and earnings per share ($0.10), but posted $4.5 billion in gross bookings—an all-time high that represented a 12% increase year-over-year. Waymo is looking to expand the market for its autonomous rides next year, with plans to bring its service to Washington, D.C., Miami and New York City. It has also been testing in cities like San Diego, Las Vegas and Houston. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana told The New York Times podcast “Hard Fork” in August “we’re currently giving hundreds of thousands of rides every week and, in all likelihood, by the end of next year, we will be offering around one million rides per week.” Waymo has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and other investors, and could see $300 million in ride revenue this year, according to a Forbes estimate. Waymo Is A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity. Google Just Needs To Seize It. (Forbes)

Title: Waymo's robotaxi expansion will get a Lyft in Nashville next year

Robotaxi leader Waymo's driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber Robotaxi leader Waymo on Wednesday announced that its driverless vehicles will begin transporting passengers in Nashville, Tennessee, next year while heading in a new direction by teaming up with Lyft instead of its recent ride-hailing partner Uber. The Nashville plan calls for robotaxi ride requests to initially be limited to Waymo's own mobile app before expanding on to Lyft's app later next year. Waymo's decision to work with Lyft in Tennessee's biggest city means its robotaxis will now be available on the apps of the two largest ride-hailing services in the U.S. As part of earlier expansions, Waymo is already dispatching robotaxis through Uber's app i n Atlanta and Austin, Texas. Electric automaker Tesla has been testing a limited driverless service in Austin in an attempt to fulfill an ambitious plan that CEO Elon Musk has been pursuing for the past decade. Even if it's in only one city, getting Waymo's industry-leading robotaxis on its app could help Lyft continue its recovery from the pandemic restrictions that decimated demand for rides. Uber bounced back from the pandemic more quickly, a comeback that has been reflected in both its financial results and market value, which has tripled since the end of 2019. Lyft's stock price, in contrast, remains about 50% below where it stood at the end of 2019. As part of its turnaround efforts, Lyft hired former Amazon executive David Risher as its CEO two years ago. Risher previously negotiated a partnership with May Mobility that is now providing driverless rides in Atlanta in competition with Waymo and Uber. This is not the first time that Waymo and Lyft have worked together. During the testing phase of its robotaxi service in Phoenix in 2019, Waymo offered a limited number of rides through Lyft. That arrangement ended after Waymo completed the Phoenix tests and began accepting driverless rides from all interested passengers on its own app more than five years ago. Since starting in Arizona, Waymo's robotaxis have provided more than 250,000 trips in cities from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles, as well as Austin and Atlanta. Waymo, which began in 2009 as a secret project within Google, also plans to expand into Dallas next year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Turbo Energy S.A. TURB stock skyrocketed Tuesday after the company announced it won a $53 million contract to deliver energy storage projects in Spain with a total capacity of 366 MWh over the next two years. The deal involves more than 10 sites operated by a major construction industry client. Turbo Energy will integrate its systems fully and use its AI-based management platform to help the facilities cut power costs, improve efficiency, and expand electrification. Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, said the agreement highlights confidence in the company's storage technology. "By entrusting us with the deployment of our C&I systems across multiple industrial facilities, this project is not only validating our competitively differentiated storage technology but also enabling substantial operational cost savings," he said.

With a range from 30 kW to 2,000 kW and storage capacity of 30 kWh to 4,000 kWh, SUNBOX Industry offers flexibility for industrial users. Its brand-agnostic design allows it to work with legacy infrastructure, easing expansion for customers facing volatile energy markets. The project advances both customer sustainability goals and Europe's decarbonization push. Turbo Energy said the expansion strengthens its role in large-scale storage and its commitment to cost-efficient clean power. Turbo Energy also revealed last week that it signed a landmark deal with Uber Technologies UBER to power the company's EV fleet in Spain. The project uses its SUNBOX Industry system to overcome grid constraints by adding flexible storage capacity, creating a 1 MW / 2 MWh smart hub capable of charging more than 300 vehicles. CEO Mariano Soria said the initiative showcases a scalable model for fleet electrification, underscoring the role of advanced storage in Europe's transportation decarbonization. ETFs such as the Invesco Solar ETF TAN and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN also provide exposure to the renewable energy market. Price Action: TURB shares were trading higher by 535.19% to $17.15 at last check Tuesday. Read Next: Image via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Title: The consulting industry is on track to get upended, and we'll all have to deal with the consequences

Welcome back! The older you get, the tougher it can be to bounce back from the weekend. But if Sam Altman's startup gets its way, aging doesn't necessarily mean decline. BI's Hilary Brueck looked at how Retro Biosciences is developing a pill to clear out the "gunk" in your brain. In today's big story, the consulting industry is on the cusp of a big overhaul, and the rest of the business world is likely to feel it. What's on deck: Markets: Forget equity, this hedge fund just wants a cut of revenue from the tech companies it backs. Tech: It's tech news, but treat it like a spectator sport. Why people love "TBPN." Business: A Real Housewives star and former Netflix exec walks us through her daily routine. But first, the synergies are no longer synergizing. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A key pipeline for funneling talent into white-collar work has sprung a big leak that won't be easy to fix. A combination of AI, shifting customer demands, and tougher paths to promotions means the consulting industry is on the cusp of being completely reshaped, writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Consultants are no strangers to volatility. In fact, a big part of their business is advising clients on the best ways to navigate change. But the current trends giving consultants plenty of work — operating more slimmed-down workforces and leveraging AI — are also impacting their own ranks. Analysts told Jennifer that the end result isn't clear, but early signs point to a tightening of senior and junior roles in the industry. BI's Polly Thompson, our resident consulting expert, has extensively reported on these trends. PwC, for example, plans to cut college graduate hiring over the next three years, with AI cited as a primary reason. That's also trickling upward as senior employees head for the exits, with several unhappy about dwindling pay and a shrinking window to reach the profession's pinnacle: partner. The rest of the business world will likely feel the effects of an upheaval within consulting. Love them or hate them, consultants are undeniably a part of the fabric of corporate America. One direct impact is the work they do with clients across the globe. Got a big business decision to make? Chances are you're going to bring in a consultant for some advice. As those firms reshape themselves, the way companies interact with, or even pay for, consultants could change. But it goes beyond that. Consulting often represents young people's foot in the white-collar workforce door. Work on a project for a few years for a client and then eventually go in-house. As the number of junior consultants dwindles, that could disrupt how countless companies stock their ranks. Those converts can also go on to do big things. Sheryl Sandberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jamie Dimon are just a few examples of high-profile consulting alums. But if anyone is well-suited to navigate a quickly moving landscape, it's consultants. After all, that's what the rest of us all pay them so much for. And if all else fails, they could always hire … a consultant. Commercial real estate is going Hollywood. You've heard of "Selling Sunset." Now get ready for "The Real Estate Commission," A&E's upcoming show about the epic highs and lows of being a commercial real estate dealmaker. Its star, Todd Drowlette, gave BI a behind-the-scenes look at the first season. A new fund wants to give tech companies the royal(ty) treatment. Althera42 wants to invest in Europe's digital infrastructure, like data centers and cloud computing, with a slight twist. Instead of getting equity, Althera42 provides capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues. The idea is to bring the investing playbook behind music royalties to tech. Beware of the gigantic price bubble. David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and a stock-market bear, warns of negative S&P 500 returns due to high valuations. The Shiller CAPE is at its third-highest level of all time. That's not the only reason Rosenberg is skeptical. Want to become fluent in tech bro? Watch "TBPN." For three hours, five days a week, hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the online show Technology Business Programming discuss tech industry drama like a spectator sport and chat with investors, founders, and sometimes journalists. BI's Julia Hornstein tuned in for a week to understand why it's become a must-watch for the chronically online tech crowd. Polymarket is about to cash in on a US expansion. The betting site, known for predicting Trump's presidential win in 2024, is raising another funding round that would sharply increase its valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Investor demand has risen as Polymarket appears ready to launch in the US. Big cuts at Musk's xAI. Elon Musk's AI startup laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team. xAI is now prioritzing specialist AI tutors over generalists, according to multiple messages viewed by BI's Grace Kay. How Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John does it all. At 5:30 am every morning, the former Netflix CMO is already meditating and praying. For BI's Power Hour series, Saint John shared her daily routine, from running a hair-care company and hosting a new Jimmy Fallon show to being a single mom. The world's richest men are buying huge media companies because they can. In 2022, Elon Musk bought what we used to call Twitter. That's what Larry Ellison is considering today by financing his son David's plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery weeks after buying Paramount. It's unlikely anyone will stand in the way, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Breaking up is hard to do. Especially when you're trying to break up with your employer of many years. The job market is tough enough already, but those who haven't had to job search in decades face age-related biases and other unique challenges.
