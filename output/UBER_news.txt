Original Coupon Deal Yes. If you like this - go for it. IMHO one of several 'Big House' champagnes that I actively avoid. This trades on the reputation of their very superior vintage wines - but is much debased. Good for ship launches. Not so good for drinking (for enjoyment). My 2 cents worth… Is these brands betters? Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Rose Vinotheque 2002 Well, Louis Roederer is the 'brand'. And yes it is better. AND you don't need to buy anything outrageously expensive (like Cristal). But if you're opening… :-) roederer NV is $90-$100, double the price of the moet in this deal. think moët just gets a bad wrap because they seem to make it in such large volumes and it’s readily available and affordable so makes champagne less of a prestige product, but some companies have access to the fruit and manage to turn out good product per $, dr loosen makes great riesling in volumes, guigal makes great rhone in volume, some companies have the resources and the process. Now you gotta give us your list! I found Cazanove vintage (2007, and '17 more recently) a great value buy when LL specials overlapped with good cashback rates. Hit ~$35 / bottle a few times per year but much rarer to see those prices now, usually $70+. Dangerous! What happens if people go out and buy what I like? Prices will rise and I'll cry/cry more! agree, usually buy as gift/congrats as it looks good. not bad drop just better imo. I don’t disagree, but it’s good to have some for people that think “champagne” is automatically better than sparkling wine, and also turn their nose up at names they don’t know. I’m not whipping out a twice as expensive bottle of Billecart Salmon for them. If you can find from Tassie - Lost Farm Cuvée Vintage 2017- ~39 per bottle. As someone who has provided many a Bolly discount here, I want to say that the Tassie drops are just as good, and offer an amazing value. Arras, Jansz, Taltarni are all fab. I also found the Gratien & Myer cremant at Dan's unbeatable at $17 but its out of stock… Would love to hear other tips!! champagne wise i like charles or n from dans, often at $50 mark, if just something with take-away, jacob’s creek trilogy at $12 - $14 as it has all 3 grape varieties, not many other australian sparkling have pinot meunier in them, also jacob’s creek reserve, it’s pinot chardonnay but bottle fermented if you only have $12-$14 , up market sparkling like the tassie mumm it’s my $35 fav along with pirrie but the mumm is often out of stock, champagne go to, like bollinger and roederer , but even on special it’s it’s a 2 bottle a year treat now. FYI $272.15 for a 6-bottles of Moet & Chandon Brut NV Champagne at Dan Murphys using the SEPT10 coupon combined with the instant Dan Murphys 5% egift cards from places like RACQ. So ~$45 per bottle. Mega, thank you ❤️ Or just buy one bottle for $49 after using the $10 discount https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/922583 Code not working for me anymore, getting an error message on payment saying that it’s expired.

Title: More Upside For Uber Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/04/more-upside-for-uber-stock/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T10:00:10Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is no longer seen as the underdog. After years of doubt regarding its ability to generate profit, the company has successfully silenced detractors and generously rewarded its shareholders. The stock has risen approximately 30% over the past year and an impressive 50% year-to-date—compared to the S&P500 index, which has increased by 17% over the last year and 10% year-to-date. The pressing question is: with Uber finally prevailing on Wall Street, is there still potential for growth? Uber’s most recent quarter revealed $12.65 billion in revenue, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, while Gross Bookings grew 17% to reach $46.8 billion. Trips surged 18% to 3.3 billion, and net income amounted to $1.35 billion. However, the notable story is centered on cash flow. Uber generated $2.48 billion in free cash flow in Q2 alone, lifting the total for the trailing 12 months to over $8.5 billion. This financial strength enabled management to confidently announce a $20 billion share buyback, nearly 10% of the company’s market cap—a significant turnaround from the era when Uber was known for its cash burn. For those seeking growth with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and recorded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Alcoa Stock To Less Than $16? At current prices, Uber is trading at approximately 30x forward earnings and about 4x sales. This represents a premium over traditional transportation and logistics companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) at 13x or United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 16x, but is more reasonable than DoorDash stock (NASDAQ: DASH), which remains unprofitable and valued at 5.5x sales. Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), which is Uber’s closest competitor in the U.S., is priced lower at about 18x forward earnings but has not demonstrated the same scale or profitability. In essence, Uber is valued like a company that operates in two realms: more stable than a pure-play transport stock, yet not as richly valued as a high-growth tech platform. Investors are essentially wagering that Uber’s market position and cash flow can justify this mid-ground valuation. Despite its strong performance, Uber continues to face numerous challenges. Lyft remains a considerable competitor in ride-hailing, and DoorDash is competing aggressively in delivery. Logistics giants FedEx and UPS pose significant challenges in e-commerce. Moreover, Uber is making bold investments in its vision for the future: autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI-driven logistics. The company has invested substantially in partnerships with Waymo, Baidu, and others, and has even acquired a $300 million stake in Lucid to support its AV ambitions. In the long run, this could enhance profit margins by reducing the reliance on drivers. However, in the short term, investors are wary—autonomous technology is costly and its timelines are unpredictable. Uber’s stock has exhibited volatility during previous market downturns, at times performing worse than the S&P 500 index. Inflation Shock (2022) COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) The significant drawdown of 67% in 2022 indicates that a considerable decline from present levels is not extraordinary. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to investor caution. See – Buy or Sell UBER Stock – for further details. With the stock up nearly 50% this year, Uber no longer appears as a deep value turnaround—it is now priced for performance. Analysts anticipate that bookings will approach $49 billion next quarter, with EBITDA guidance exceeding $2.2 billion. If Uber continues to deliver growth at this scale while repurchasing shares, the rally could gain momentum. The risk? At 30x forward earnings, Uber has less room for error. Any slowdown in global demand, stricter labor regulations, or setbacks in its autonomous strategies could lead to declines. However, Uber has decisively shed its former reputation and presents itself as a cash-rich, scalable platform. Investors are no longer just along for the ride with Uber—they are actively steering the gains. The substantial valuation of UBER stock might curtail its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As a different option, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), providing strong returns for investors. The reasoning? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, further explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Already have an account?Sign in Last month, Kith made a statement by literally stopping New York traffic to host a runway show titled “INSTITUTION.” Now, with the opening of Kith IVY, it’s going beyond mere New York institution. A private padel club housed on the rooftop of a West Village residential commercial building, Kith Ivy is also host to New York’s first-ever Erewhon. Yes, streetwear mega-retailer Kith managed to coax Erewhon out of its LA home for the first time, delivering its pricey, organic, celebrity-cosigned smoothies to the people of New York. But there’s a catch. According to reports, it’ll cost $36,000 in initiation fees plus an annual payment of $7,000 to get access to Kith Ivy and, by extension, the in-house Erewhon. As if paying $20 for Hailey Bieber's Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie wasn’t already enough. Note that even for that price, you don’t get access to an entire Erewhon supermarket but an Erewhon-branded tonic bar. Still, Kith Ivy comes with amenities like that aforementioned padel court, a private gym, and a restaurant by the owners of the East Village’s Cafe Mogador. There’s also a boutique that’ll stock Kith’s new Padel line of the same name. However, all is not lost for anyone craving an Erewhon smoothie in the Big Apple. New Yorkers within the vicinity of Kith Ivy will be able to get smoothies delivered from Erewhon’s Kith Ivy outpost via Postmates and Uber Eats. Kith already wears many hats, of course. It's a retailer with 21 outposts worldwide, a similarly expansive cereal bar, a fashion brand with handfuls of diffusion lines, and a many-armed collaborator on everything from sports cars to dad shoes. This new project marks a significant expansion to the already vast Kith-everse. "The Kith Ivy club in New York is our most holistic entry into hospitality, expanding outside of dining into true lifestyle services, sport and wellness, and product," commented Kith founder Ronnie Fieg in a statement. Kith can now add "home to the first Erewhon outside of California," to its long list of accomplishments.

Title: Understanding Dynamic Pricing in Digital Marketing

Time Published: 2025-09-02T01:23:23Z

Engineering Tomorrow’s Stories. Dynamic pricing is a strategic pricing approach that allows businesses to adjust prices for their products or services in real-time, based on market demand, competitor pricing, and various consumer behaviors. Unlike traditional pricing models, which often set fixed prices for a longer duration, dynamic pricing is highly responsive and can shift frequently, sometimes even multiple times within a day. This flexibility makes it an increasingly popular strategy in today’s rapidly changing market landscape. The roots of dynamic pricing can be traced back to industries where demand fluctuates significantly, such as airlines, hotels, and entertainment. Airline ticket prices, for example, often change based on the season, time until departure, or even how many seats are still available. In the retail sector, online platforms frequently utilize dynamic pricing algorithms to adjust prices according to competitor actions and customer purchasing trends in real time. By leveraging these strategies, businesses can maximize revenue while remaining competitive. Central to the implementation of dynamic pricing are sophisticated pricing algorithms and real-time data analysis. These technologies empower companies to process large volumes of data related to market conditions, consumer behavior, and competitive pricing, allowing for informed pricing decisions. As a result, companies can optimize their pricing strategy to boost sales and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Furthermore, dynamic pricing is not limited to a single sector; it spans various industries, including e-commerce, food delivery, and ride-sharing services. While it offers numerous advantages such as increased profitability and competitive pricing, it also raises ethical considerations regarding transparency and fairness. Employing this strategy requires careful consideration to ensure that customers perceive value without feeling exploited. Dynamic pricing thus represents a balance between optimizing revenue and maintaining consumer trust. Data analytics plays a pivotal role in the successful implementation of dynamic pricing strategies within digital marketing. In a rapidly changing market environment, businesses must leverage various data sources to optimize their pricing models effectively. Key among these data sources is historical sales data, which provides insights into past consumer purchasing behavior and helps forecast future demand trends. Analyzing sales patterns allows businesses to identify peak purchasing times and set competitive prices accordingly. Another crucial data source is competitor pricing. By monitoring competitors’ pricing strategies, businesses can remain agile and responsive to market changes. Tools for price tracking enable companies to adjust their pricing in real-time, ensuring they stay competitive without sacrificing profitability. Additionally, mergers of competitor pricing data with historical sales analytics can uncover opportunities for price adjustments that attract price-sensitive customers while also maintaining margins. Customer behavior insights are equally important in shaping dynamic pricing strategies. Understanding consumer demographics, preferences, and purchasing habits allows businesses to tailor their pricing accordingly. For instance, utilizing customer segment data can facilitate personalized pricing offers, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Advanced analytics tools and technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, can analyze vast amounts of consumer data to uncover hidden patterns that inform pricing decisions. Businesses can benefit from various tools designed for data collection and analysis, such as CRM software, price optimization platforms, and business intelligence dashboards. These technologies not only streamline data management but also empower firms to interpret the data accurately and make informed pricing decisions. By harnessing the power of data analytics, companies can enhance their dynamic pricing strategies, improving their competitiveness and maximizing profitability in a dynamic digital marketplace. Dynamic pricing has emerged as a formidable strategy in the realm of digital marketing, offering numerous benefits that can significantly enhance a company’s bottom line. One of the most pronounced advantages is the potential for increased revenue. By adjusting prices in real time based on demand, competition, and other market factors, companies can capitalize on high-demand periods, ensuring they maximize their earnings. This pricing flexibility fosters an opportunity for businesses to respond swiftly to market fluctuations, thus optimizing their profitability. Additionally, dynamic pricing enables better inventory management. Retailers can lower prices on excess stock to accelerate sales or increase prices on high-demand items to strategically manage inventory levels. This responsive approach not only minimizes unsold inventory but also fosters a more efficient supply chain, aligning prices with customer demand and market conditions. Improved customer targeting is another significant benefit of this pricing model. By analyzing customer data and behavior, businesses can tailor pricing strategies to specific segments, resulting in more personalized offers. This capability enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately translating to higher sales and retention rates. However, the adoption of dynamic pricing does come with its challenges. Customer dissatisfaction can arise when buyers perceive prices as unfair or inconsistent, potentially leading to brand alienation. Furthermore, the complexity of the algorithms required to implement dynamic pricing can be daunting. Developing a system that accurately reflects market changes and customer willingness to pay can require sophisticated analytics and constant monitoring, which may be resource-intensive. Ethical concerns also emerge regarding pricing transparency. Some consumers may feel manipulated if they discover that they were charged different prices for the same product based on their timing or demographic information. For instance, ride-sharing companies like Uber have faced backlash for surge pricing methods, which have drawn criticism for their lack of clarity and potential exploitation. Real-world examples highlight both the successes and struggles of dynamic pricing in action. Airlines and hospitality sectors regularly utilize dynamic pricing with positive outcomes, capturing peak demand while maximizing revenue. In contrast, businesses lacking a clear strategy may face backlash if customers feel their pricing is arbitrary. Implementing dynamic pricing strategies requires careful planning and execution to ensure success. First, businesses should begin by setting clear objectives. Determining the specific goals behind the dynamic pricing model is essential. These goals may include increasing sales, optimizing inventory, or improving profit margins. Having well-defined objectives allows businesses to measure success effectively and make necessary adjustments along the way. Next, selecting the right technology is key to implementing a successful dynamic pricing strategy. Several pricing software options are available that facilitate data analysis and automate the adjustment of prices based on market conditions. Companies should evaluate these tools based on scalability, usability, and integration capabilities with existing systems. Implementing the right technology can significantly enhance a business’s responsiveness to market trends and customer behaviors. A flexible pricing model should be developed to accommodate the varying demands of the market. It is important to consider external factors, such as competitor pricing and customer perceptions, when establishing price points. Regularly revisiting and updating the pricing model ensures that it remains relevant and competitive. Continuous monitoring of performance is also crucial. Businesses should utilize analytics to assess the effectiveness of their dynamic pricing strategy by tracking sales data and customer feedback, allowing for timely adaptations. Effective communication and transparency with customers is vital in fostering trust in a dynamic pricing model. Customers should be educated about how dynamic pricing works and the factors that influence price changes. Providing clear information can alleviate confusion and enhance customer loyalty. Implementing customer-friendly policies regarding pricing changes can further improve perception and acceptance of dynamic pricing. In conclusion, by following these best practices, businesses can successfully integrate dynamic pricing into their digital marketing strategies while maximizing customer satisfaction and profits.

Prioritizing sustainable health habits is crucial for business success. Fit and healthy leaders make more money. But if you’re unfit, your business probably is too. CEO health problems are linked with lower corporate performance. Without peak health you’re less good at strategic decision-making, which directly correlates with revenue, profit, and happiness as a leader. Do you feel energised, strong and confident every day? Or is health and fitness something you believe you have to sacrifice for business success? Too many founders think business success comes at a price. But what if that’s not true? Anthony Ng Monica is the founder & CEO of Daily Body Coach, a performance-optimization coaching service for entrepreneurs and executives. A former tech founder with a successful exit, he now brings together elite certified coaches in training, nutrition, and psychology to help business leaders achieve peak performance. Designed to fit seamlessly into demanding lifestyles, the Daily Body Coach program empowers clients to become better leaders, healthier individuals, and more successful in business. From experience working with hundreds of business leaders, including founders of 7, 8 and 9-figure and publicly-traded companies, here are the 5 common health mistakes Ng Monica sees on repeat. “Push harder” screams the personal trainer. But it doesn’t work. It never does. Ng Monica takes a different approach. “The real trick is to identify what you genuinely enjoy, that fits seamlessly into your lifestyle,” he said. “Once you’ve done that, sticking with it becomes effortless and performance compounds.” If you need motivation, you’re doing it wrong. Pro athletes and people with incredible levels of health and fitness aren’t relying on willpower to get them out of bed and into the gym. Instead, it’s part of their identity. They have created habits around the identity of being someone who takes care of themselves. Once you do this, it becomes easier to be healthy than not to be. All-or-nothing thinking is common among entrepreneurs. Business situations are either total successes or complete failures. You’re either having the best day ever or you hit rock bottom, with little appreciation for incremental progress or nuance. The founders Ng Monica works with are no different, but he teaches a different way forward when it comes to health. “Founders already have busy schedules. The moment a founder’s routine breaks (which can be for travel, a date night, or business lunch), everything else follows,” he said. “Without an intentional plan, they’ll fall off. One day turns into five, they’ve been set back and it becomes a grind to get back at it.” One bad day shouldn’t mean everything unravels. You’re better than that. Instead of polarising health and fitness, find the sustainable middle ground where balance is key. “Progress isn’t about perfection. Avoid feeling the need to compensate. Just press ahead with the plan and don’t let a single bad day define your direction” You plan your business goals in quarterly increments. You measure the stats and have progress meetings. You’re always working towards goals. But why isn’t this the same for health? “One founder we work with used to return from every business trip five pounds heavier. But learning how to handle business travel helped him avoid that,” explained Ng Monica. “What we told him was simple. Skip the welcome snacks and plane food (it’s never good anyway). Make smarter choices at the airport.” You don’t need to make progress on your business trips. Just don’t regress. Plan your health like you plan your marketing campaigns. “Have back up plans on Uber Eats or Doordash that you can default to when you don’t have time,” advised Ng Monica. “It takes the same amount of time to eat something healthy versus unhealthy.” “We see a lot of clients want to ‘save calories’ when going out for dinner, so they start restricting their lunch,” explained Ng Monica. “But they arrive at the restaurant so hungry that they have a hard time being rational and making healthy choices. It’s like going to the grocery store while hungry.” This isn’t the plan. Instead of consistently missing your targets and never finding out why, get real. Listen to your body. Apply second order thinking to the structure of your day. If you skip breakfast, how will you feel at 2pm? If you don’t stock your fridge with healthy food, what’s going to happen when you pass a donut shop? It becomes obvious when you think about it. “There are so many companies in the health and fitness space,” said Ng Monica. “But most of what they share isn’t true or helpful.” Most of health and fitness comes down to four simple pillars: nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress. “Unscrupulous practitioners prey on knowledge gaps and weaknesses of people,” added Ng Monica. In business, there are no quick fixes. Everyone wants to get rich yesterday, but the truly rich built their wealth over a number of years. If you cut corners, your customers find out. If you look to score a quick buck, you’ll build a reputation for being dodgy. Health is the same. “Good consistently equals great,” said Ng Monica. “Every time you find a shortcut, you’ll pay for it later.” Don’t create debt for your future self. If you can build a six or seven figure company, you already did the difficult part. You can develop healthy habits in health and fitness. Avoid the six common mistakes costing leaders their company performance. Don’t fall for the motivation trap, find balance instead of operating at the extremes, and plan ahead for an easy existence. Know why you go off track, unlink food from emotions, and stop looking for hacks because they don’t exist. It’s never too soon to take this seriously.
