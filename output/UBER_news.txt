Title: Wearables report card 2025: How smartwatches, rings, and glasses fared this year against my predictions

Smart glasses grew beyond analysts' predictions, Oura crushed rivals with patents, and Garmin charged a premium for new models. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been a dramatic 2025 for wearables. Some trends were predictable, like smart glasses continuing their exponential growth and smartwatches adding more AI and health features. But I didn't anticipate some things, like Oura lawsuits strangling its smart ring rivals or the impact of tariffs. I've decided to look back on my 2025 forecast for smart rings, glasses, and watches, including two analysts' predictions, and judge how well our collective expectations lined up with reality. Then, I'll look at the biggest wearable and fitness watch brands and grade their 2025 performance — where they succeeded and how they could have done better. As expected, Garmin tested "loyal users' willingness to buy pricier status-symbol smartwatches." The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($1.2–2K) and Venu X1 ($800) are clear examples, but even mid-rangers like the Venu 4 ($550) have become more high-end. Add in the $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3, $500 and $650 Galaxy Watches, and the $1,000 Polar Grit X2 Pro, and you can see brands normalizing phone-level prices (and offsetting tariff costs). It was also expected that there would be "more options" for thrifty consumers. The Apple Watch SE 3 qualifies, sticking to its old $250 price, but it's the exception. We saw cheap trackers from Xiaomi and CMF, but very few cheap Android smartwatches besides discounted last-gen models. Even Amazfit sold as many $300+ watches as $100 ones. Tariffs have interfered with budget options, making it more profitable to attract wealthier hobbyists. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Meanwhile, Google, Samsung, and Apple started pushing the idea of smartwatch AI in 2025. But it's still mostly on-phone processing of queries and health data analysis. The Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch S11 have on-watch AI tools like smart replies or live translation, and I appreciate how Gemini on Android watches syncs well with Google apps. I expect a bigger AI push in 2026, particularly with the Fitbit Personal Health Coach AI. Again, companies clearly want smartwatches to become medical devices, but we're still in the predictive "wellness" phase. For example, Samsung added virtual doctor's visits and prescription management while giving its watches vascular health and antioxidant index analysis, with heart failure warnings coming soon. That said, my analyst's prediction of direct blood pressure monitoring on watches in 2025 didn't happen. But Apple started offering hypertension alerts, while Fitbit and Oura launched hypertension studies — so at least we're getting warning signs for high blood pressure. As for smart rings, I don't have hard figures for 2025 yet, but IDC's current estimates show it's a tiny but growing sliver compared to fitness trackers, and growing much more slowly than smart glasses. Sales have grown, but I'm expecting the category to stagnate. Oura has leveraged its patents to demand royalty payments from every major smart ring brand, bringing Circular and RingConn to heel, successfully banning Ultrahuman from the U.S., and currently challenging Samsung. The current rumor is that Samsung won't make a Galaxy Ring 2, and there's little hope for competition and innovation in the space if brands like Fitbit and Apple decide it's not worth the legal hassle — or giving Oura a cut of the profits — to make a smart ring. Finally, IDC's Jitesh Ubrani wasn't bullish on smart glasses' future last year, saying that "most consumers don't need" the photo/ video/ music/ AI combo and that sales would only climb from 2.5 million to 3.5 million in 2025. Turns out, IDC's current forecast is 9.4 million glasses sold in 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban/Oakley partner EssilorLuxottica has ramped up production to 10 million per year, and Ubrani is much more enthusiastic about smart glasses' future. That said, 10 million sold may not qualify as "mainstream," compared to 200 million smartwatches and trackers in 2025. The Samsung AI and HUD glasses coming in 2026 should help the category continue to grow, especially internationally. Garmin launched a series of successful, high-quality watches this year: the Instinct 3 for hikers and campers, the Vivoactive 6 for thrifty indoor athletes and daily step-counters, the Forerunner 570 for runners and triathletes, the Forerunner 970 for pro-level athletes and trail runners, and the Venu 4 as the all-around best option. Unfortunately, Garmin raised watch prices across its entire lineup for extra revenue, delivering strong earnings but making them less accessible to everyday athletes. As much as I love the Venu X1, I can't recommend people spend $800 on one. From an economic standpoint, Garmin has become a top-5 brand for worldwide smartwatch sales. Despite that, Garmin's stock plummeted because its uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro couldn't compete with last year's massive Fenix 8 sales, undoing all its gains. The new Garmin Connect+ subscription, which launched this year, may have earned some profits, but Garmin fans have never embraced the feature, especially when it's required for features like Garmin Trails, extra badges, and their Year in Review summary. Unrealistic shareholder expectations aside, Garmin has had a strong year, but its tendency to price-lock the best features to Fenix-level watches is harder to stomach when the "cheaper" models are still expensive. And you never know when there'll be a major blue triangle crash. I won't grade every fitness watch brand, but I'm highlighting COROS because it's had a strong 2025 as a foil to Garmin. The COROS Nomad, Apex 4, and Pace 4 have each impressed me with their accurate GPS and HR data, weeks of battery life, affordable prices, and fast performance for trail and street maps. COROS gained some ground on its rivals with vital features: media playback controls, move alerts, undo laps, flashlight mode, cycle tracking, mid-activity voice alerts, street names and POIs on maps, and an adventure journal. Equally important, COROS updates its entire lineup, rather than price-lock features to the flagships. It makes models like the $300 COROS Pace Pro feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have. It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's 2025 end-of-year report. It won't catch up to Garmin (2nd overall) anytime soon, but COROS has earned a reputation for budget quality with serious athletes — stealing Garmin's customers. COROS's main 2025 blemish was an IT exposé revealing major security vulnerabilities on all COROS watches, letting hackers potentially access your account, snoop on notifications, and worse. COROS says it has resolved these issues, thankfully. Oura reports selling 5.5 million rings so far, with half those sales in the past 12 months. It also has a new U.S. DoD contract, which requires them to build a manufacturing facility in Texas. This deal also caused some backlash over fears Oura would share private data with the Trump administration, but CEO Tom Hale has reassured otherwise. The Oura Ring 4 continuously received new features in 2025. The LLM-powered Oura Advisor is the centerpiece, giving advice and coaching based on your ring stats. The AI Meals tool gives you a nutritional summary of your plate with a photo. Your Oura Ring can now track pregnancy and premenopause symptoms. Its Preventive Health data studies signs of cumulative stress. The list goes on! Oura also launched the Ring 4 Ceramic, a more expensive model with premium zirconia ceramic materials. While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4. Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest. That's a good business position to be in. Meta released three pairs of smart glasses in 2025, which is a significant accomplishment. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the centerpiece, and while it isn't significantly different from the original, the extra hours of battery and 3K video do make it easier to recommend. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cater specifically to the athletic crowd, particularly with the Garmin integration, and while I loved them, it'll take time to see whether they resonate because of the weight and price. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses have struck a chord with the tech niche, with some impressive HUD features that have started to live up to the Google Glass idea people have waited a decade for. They're too thick, heavy, and expensive to break out of that niche, but it's a step in the right direction. Hardware aside, Meta has done well with software updates in 2025. It added Meta AI support for several apps (Audible, Spotify, Google Calendar, Outlook, and Weather), released Live AI and Live Translation, sped up camera captures, and brought Gen 2 features like improved stabilization to the Gen 1 glasses.

Title: Economic Sentiment Collapses to All-Time Lows, Why?

Time Published: 2025-12-19T16:32:34Z

If you only looked at the gold standard(?) Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey’s new report, you would think we were in the midst of a generational economic crash surpassing the scale of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis or the stagflationary malaise of the 1970s where the Misery Index hit all-time highs. A new survey is out today, and it reveals a populace with incredibly negative forward-looking views on the economy. This certainly is related to Trump, who per a recent AP-NORC poll, had his lowest approval rating ever on the economy (31%), which surely helped prompt president sundown to rant to the country on primetime TV this week. But the fact that the 2025 line is digging down as deep as the 2022 line proves that this is not a Trump-centric dynamic, and people feel bad about the economy for reasons that go beyond tariffs and all his other ineffectual bullshit. Source: University of Michigan via FRED® Those grey bars indicate recessions, revealing why this is, or perhaps was, looked to as a gold standard for consumer sentiment. By the pattern established over the last half-century, there should be grey bars in 2022 and right now, and yet, GDP is growing. One might think this is because of our age of inequality, where this survey picks up the bulk of people struggling while the economy is held up by the wealthy (a dynamic that is true that I will dig into in the K-shaped recovery section), but the truth is that wage growth for the lowest earners has grown relative to higher earners since the pandemic. As Matt Darling demonstrates by parsing out the consumer sentiment data, a lot of this new negative sentiment is actually coming from the top income tercile, revealing the backlash from capital against labor in response to the strong labor market we experienced in the wake of the pandemic shock. There is not one singular explanation for what is happening to the economic vibes in America. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index [image or embed] — Matt Darling (@besttrousers.bsky.social) December 18, 2025 at 6:17 AM This has become an exhausting debate because a lot of people who lack economic expertise are certain that either non-economists like Will Stancil are right and everyone has gone completely insane, or those dogpiling him in his mentions claiming that the GDP figures are lies and we actually have been in a Great Depression for a few years are certain they’re right. If you pay attention to the actual trained economic knowers, certainty is not a feature of their analysis. That has been beaten out of every one of us to step into a serious financial arena. You know nothing. You are nothing. The whole world is a range of probabilities, and you will be humbled by it. All we can say for certain is that after the pandemic, the vibes drastically changed for a lot of Americans, and you can see it in the split between the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence survey and the University of Michigan’s. 🚨USE THE CONFERENCE BOARD MEASURE OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE! IGNORE MICHIGAN–DO NOT RUN AWAY WITH GRANDIOSE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORLD BASED ON UMICH!🚨 [image or embed] — Julia Coronado (@jc-econ.bsky.social) December 19, 2025 at 9:22 AM Their methodologies are different, which certainly gives us some insight into the post-2020 divergence. The Conference Board asks respondents about current business and employment conditions as well as business conditions, employment, and income expectations six months from now, while UMich asks people about their personal finances, buying conditions and future expectations for the economy. It’s clear now that for economic forecasters, survey questions about personal finances are not useful to understanding a broader economy chugging along fairly well in large part thanks to gargantuan AI capital expenditure spending. That the United States has grown out of the pandemic far faster than its peers is also lost in all the bad vibes. But something is clearly going on that’s deeper than ‘people let TikTok make them think they’re destitute’ or ‘economic data is bourgeois bullshit,’ and I will venture some guesses here as to what is happening. Because despite all the online squabbling that has taken place around the vibecession since 2022, there is something real and important to all this. Consumer sentiment roughly translates to consumer spending, the engine of our economy (at least before AI), hence why recessions coincide with collapses in it. This is serious stuff, and it can’t all be handwaved away as vibes. This is a title of a 2021 paper from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and you don’t need an economics degree to understand the point it makes, just look at the shape of the letter K. One diagonal line is going up, and the other is going down, resembling the most important chart in American politics and economics over the last fifty years. Americans don’t get paid well relative to the productivity we create. Capitalism is built by capital, and so the spoils of it go to them. This has been true for decades, as the above chart demonstrates, so this cynicism is clearly not solely responsible for the recent drop in consumer sentiment, but I do think this raw deal has become more salient since the pandemic. I screenshotted these charts from the BLS report which tracked percentage changes in employment from February 2020 to May 2021, broken down by five income buckets, and a clear pattern emerges. Pay attention to the orange lines tracking employment loss due to closures. People at different income levels live in different worlds. Digging into the vibecession stuff again today and I think these charts from a 2021 BLS paper on the K-shaped recovery are instructive. www.bls.gov/osmr/researc… [image or embed] — Jacob Weindling (@jakeweindling.bsky.social) December 19, 2025 at 10:22 AM As I detailed in my piece about the poverty line last month, it’s a lot higher than our mainstream discourse thinks. It’s not $140,000 per year like one viral economic blogger suggested, but a much more thoughtful measure called Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed households (ALICE) finds that 42% of American households—55 million—fall below their financial hardship threshold. It is adjusted for cost of living by county, and this gets to the heart of the alleged K-shaped recovery that admittedly has become a bit messier of a narrative as time has gone on and lower income wages have grown, although the core structure of the letter remains in place as a broader economic principle. “If there’s a single stat to capture what’s happening to the economy, it’s this: The top 10% of U.S. earners now make up half of all spending, and it’s changing everything,” wrote journalist Matt Pearce today. “Delta Air Lines expects to make more money soon from luxury and business fliers at the front of the plane than from everybody else.” I wrote about this revelation from Moody’s Analytics earlier this year, and how connected it is to the stock market creating a wealth effect fueling this spending. “Affluent people also found themselves with assets, such as stocks, that suddenly were worth far more,” wrote the Wall Street Journal back in February. “The net worth of the top 20% of earners has risen by more than $35 trillion, or 45%, since the end of 2019, according to Federal Reserve data. Net worth grew at a similar rate for everyone else, but it translated to a lot less money: an increase of $14 trillion for the bottom 80%.” Many Stancilites will point to the fact that wage growth for the lowest earners has outpaced those of higher earners, but fail to recognize the facts of a rate of change metric. Look at those charts I screenshotted above, measuring from 2020 is measuring from a complete collapse, and while ten steps back and seven steps forward does give you a pretty good rate of change result, you’re still down a net of three steps from where you started. That’s the employment situation a lot of low wage earners are dealing with these days in our cooling job market, and jobs like cashiers that once were some of the most prevalent in America are now being replaced by robots. The same is true for entry level college graduates, as the bottom layer of many organizational charts is being replaced with AI as we speak. That may help the company save money and aid executives’ spending fueled by their stock-based compensation that makes topline economic figures look good, but it doesn’t do much for the low wage worker whose job is being replaced and isn’t seeing the benefits of the broader economy. In many ways, AI is the poster child for the K-shaped economy. Executives like Elon Musk are openly plotting to kill our jobs, and are promising us a future utopia with “universal high income” at an undetermined later date. Inflation is higher for the bottom leg of the K too. Inflation hits lower earners harder for the simple fact that one divided by fifty is a higher percentage than one divided by fifty thousand, and while overall inflation has been coming down since its peak in 2022 coinciding with the low in the consumer confidence survey, specific goods that lower income people spend the majority of their money on have not dropped as far as topline inflation has. The latest inflation figures felt a bit soft and could be due to just wonkish changes in methodology, but rigging BLS numbers is very difficult and until there’s real evidence of it, no one should think that Trump’s tentacles have reached this far yet. Taking the latest inflation print at face value, the topline figure of 2.7% inflation is good. The Fed’s target of healthy inflation is 2%, so it stands to reason that things should feel like they’re stabilizing, right? Except that food away from home at restaurants is at 3.7% year-over-year inflation. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs are 4.7%, shelter is at 3%, medical care services is at 2.9%, used cars and trucks is at 3.6%, while energy, a big monthly percentage cost for middle class and lower income earners, is up 4.2%, with natural gas up a stunning 9.1%. Energy prices are rising for a lot of reasons, AI data center demand, tariffs, Trump destroying a revolution in clean energy and domestic manufacturing and restricting the supply we can deliver to our energy grid, and a lot of geopolitical stuff that would turn this into a 10,000-word blog, but the net result is that everyone’s paying a noticeably higher energy bill this winter than they were last winter. Trump points to the price of oil being low which is true, gasoline inflation is just 0.9%, but in a work-from-home world willing to buy Nazi cars if they’re electric, that matters less than how you power your home and business, which is not with gasoline. Ever since the pandemic, the stock market has shot off to all-time highs, taking the net worths of stock holders to all-time highs. Between their spending and seven companies creating a human centipede of centibillion-dollar AI investments, that is basically what is powering the bulk of the economy. That is why the vibes are shit. Because people go to the grocery store and can’t afford steak anymore and then are told that they’re just hallucinating their own economic misery as they scroll their phone and see Mark Zuckerberg shrugging his shoulders over potentially setting $500 billion on fire. Our modern Gilded Age has created siloed economic worlds whose lived experience is very different from each other depending on how much you make, how many assets you own and where you live. If it feels like different economic classes of Americans inhabit different economic realities, that’s because they do. But we do have to give the vibes caucus some credit here. It’s not called the vibecession for nothing, and we would be a lot better off if the explanations of the term’s inventor, Kyla Scanlon, were more central to the online discourse than the former political candidate whose opponents mailed his own posts to his constituents as an attack ad. This is nuanced stuff, and each side of the vibes vs. recession argument has a point, as Scanlon wrote in December 2023, “A slowdown in the rate of increase in price levels doesn’t really mean all that much when you’ve been living in an absolute price pressure cooker for three years.” Some prices are lower than they were in 2022, but higher than they were in 2019, and they’re not the only drastic shift the entire populace has experienced. Computer work for many above a certain income level has fundamentally changed, while those working in brick-and-mortar businesses and manufacturing cannot afford the same luxury. Many people are still dealing with the physical health and economic problems imposed upon society by a global pandemic that still has not ended, while social media is an even more ubiquitous force in our lives. We are just aware of more anecdotal stories of struggle now, which has made it more difficult to see the bigger economic picture amidst the worst inequality in a century. Add in the actual precarity around 42% of households feel per ALICE’s data, and this is a perfect cocktail for confusion. But the root of it is that the world changed and our expectations for it largely have not. The 2024 election was many things, but pressing a button to return to 2019 was absolutely behind a lot of people’s shockingly naive Trump votes. Something fundamentally broke in our society in 2020, a kind of trust that underwrites civil societies across time, and it manifests itself in every realm, especially economics where the split between the haves and have nots is most measurable. People feel bad about their situation relative to before the whole world changed seemingly overnight, and they are more aware of those who are benefiting from this period of collective misery. People know that The Great Gatsby is taking place every day in every major American city, and we can only hope that these people will not deliver us a future like The Grapes of Wrath. Anchoring is a very important financial concept. One of the things that surprised me in my finance classes was how central psychology was to many of them. The expectations that you set for yourself are of utmost importance because they serve as an anchor, and how you perceive everything else becomes relative to those expectations. In the wake of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, Americans experienced unprecedented levels of cheap credit that fueled a generation of affordable burrito taxis and other creature comforts of consumerism. When investors could weaponize Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) to load up on low-to-no-interest debt and then use that debt to invest in companies whose future cash flows became inflated thanks to ZIRP math, consumers had it easy as countless cans got kicked down the road. Tech giants arming themselves for their societal takeover in this era were and are able to carry immense debt levels because it cost them nothing to do so, and the simple change of a zero to a two, three, four or even nine back in 2022 has fundamentally altered the entire economy to a mathematical degree that many people just can’t understand, including the president, who is practically demanding that the next Fed governor bring ZIRP back as a requirement to get the job. Our expectations are still anchored to a world built by ZIRP. A world of easy money delivering us cheap burrito taxis and fueling the economy in the wake of a gargantuan economic collapse. A world where Elon Musk can become the richest man alive by creating the greatest meme stock in history, entirely fueled by the easiest money in a generation, enabling you to get rich off stupid speculative bullshit too. A world where Donald Trump could build a path to the presidency on cheap credit after going bankrupt six times. A world where cryptobillionaires buying their own libertarian islands is a real thing and not some modern James Bond plot. One of the many indignities of the K-shaped recovery out of 2020 is that we did get ZIRP again in that crisis, but it only benefited asset holders and created an excessive speculative mania, while it delivered consumers 9% inflation. The world of cheap burrito taxis is gone, and a lot of the deteriorating vibes are centered around the cost that higher interest rates and better wages for low wage workers have imposed on products that were cheap and accessible a decade ago. Trump is the avatar for the broad-based misunderstanding of this post-ZIRP era, where he is determined to make the same mistakes as the stagflationary 1970s in a desperate bid to make ZIRP great again and bring its creature comforts back. Perhaps it is because I graduated into the job market in 2009, a year where we began losing 800,000 jobs a month, and thus have a bias about 2008, but I think it is the central fault line in our present age. It is where both the capitalist backlash on the left and the reactionary fascism on the right have sprung from, and where fervent modern distrust of the establishment was born. The Iraq War was our generation’s Vietnam, but the widespread age of distrust began when a bunch of criminals defrauded the world and came within days of completely nuking the entire global economy. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is wrongly looked back at negatively for many reasons—a lot of leftists falsely attribute the bailout to Obama, but a simple recap of the nature of linear time will reveal this was a Bush bailout—and it is reviled by many for being a handout, but that is wrong too. We got paid back. The best critique of TARP was that it wasn’t big enough and Congress chickened out because they didn’t want to vote for something with a trillion-dollar price tag even though the scale of the crisis could only be measured in the trillions. A gigantic hole got blown in the economy by fraudulent financial schemes orchestrated by the uber-elite, upending millions if not billions of people’s lives for a generation. We know that those like me who graduated in its wake have had their professional prospects harmed relative to people who did not graduate into the genesis of ZIRP, while professions like lawyers and academics suffered, and the economy changed in a very fundamental way. The bitterness around TARP is that in 2008, Wall Street got bailed out but Main Street didn’t, which is a valid criticism, but Wall Street had to get bailed out. We had no choice; we’d be using bottle caps for currency right now if we hadn’t. But instead of fixing the fundamental economic problems in our age of inequality revealed by 2008, we just flooded the zone with cheap debt which jacked up asset prices and made inequality exponentially worse. What once was viewed as a policy only to be utilized in emergencies now became a decade-plus of a wildly distorted and anomalous status quo. We didn’t fix what 2008 broke, we just built a land of unsustainable burrito taxis and increasing financialization hacking the magic of zero percent interest rates. When 2020 rolled around and we were forced to enact emergency ZIRP measures again, this didn’t spawn another wave of affordable burrito taxis, but dog coins and inflation, proving the limits of this policy. I wrote last week about why gambling is everywhere, because the scam economy can be accessed by anyone now, and as dismaying as the rise of prediction markets and sports betting and crypto and zero date options trading and all other forms of high-risk gambling spreading to every nook and cranny of the world has been, it’s just following the broader trend in our hollowed-out and speculative economy. You don’t make it in a capitalist economy by selling your labor, that’s the sucker’s way out. You make it in a capitalist economy by buying assets, and that fact has become evident amidst 42% of households struggling to build wealth in the face of all-time high house prices and an all-time high stock market. I think consumer sentiment is near all-time lows because of a combination of real and widespread economic hardship, the drumbeat of the vibecession narrative on social media and major media reinforcing anecdotal evidence of real hardship, and the gobsmackingly shameless greed of the wealthy. It has all led many people to agree with George Carlin’s most famous line: it’s called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.

In November 2025, Valve “unveiled” the Steam Machine – a living room PC designed to bring your Steam library to the TV. Gaming press covered it as news, but what was missing from the headlines was that this is actually Steam Machine 2.0. Valve already tried this a decade ago, and it flopped. So why try again? Thanks for reading Garbage Collected! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Because Valve learned from that failure. They learned what Apple had figured out years earlier – hardware, software, and services need to, to quote Jobs, “just work” (2011 WWDC). This isn’t speculation. Take it from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell’s own thoughts on threats to PC gaming: The threat right now is that Apple has gained a huge amount of market share, and has a relatively obvious pathway towards entering the living room with their platform [...] I think Apple rolls the console guys really easily. The question is can we make enough progress in the PC space to establish ourselves there, and also figure out better ways of addressing mobile before Apple takes over the living room? (Talk at University of Texas’s LBJ School of Public Affairs, via Polygon in 2013) Newell wasn’t worried about Nintendo, PlayStation, or Xbox; he was worried about Apple, who weren’t even in gaming then (and still aren’t today). His solution? Run Apple’s playbook, but do it in reverse. To understand what Valve is doing, it helps to see the paths both companies took, and how they mirror each other. Apple’s path to becoming the modern corporate juggernaut that nobody saw coming even 20 years ago needs little introduction: Macs, to portable Macbooks, to portable music (iPods), to iPhones, to App Store, to Everything Else, each step further locking customers into the ecosystem through hardware that “just works”. Valve was founded by ex-Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington in the late 90s following their frustration that, among other things, Microsoft was getting outflanked in gaming by startups with a better understanding of how to use the internet. As you might expect from a company with that origin, they started by making video games like Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Counter-Strike. Steam came in 2003, created for easy management of updates for their games over the Internet (what today would be called a “proprietary launcher”). What Valve soon realized, though, is that they could turn this “cost” into a source of revenue by making their solutions available to other developers, and so came the Steam Store and services (2005). Over time, they built on this, adding features like Managed Matchmaking and Cloud Saves before they took their first crack at hardware in 2015 with Steam Machine 1.0 (aka the Steam Box). The Steam Box… didn’t do so hot. We’ll get to that. After that, the important points in the timeline to note for this narrative are the release of the Steam Deck (a portable PC gaming device, perhaps most analogous in function to the Nintendo Switch) in 2022, and the instigator for today, the announcement of the Steam Machine (2.0) for 2026. For a snapshot of how Steam stands today: Regularly peaks at ~41MM concurrent users on weekends: https://store.steampowered.com/stats/stats/ Note: that’s concurrent users, not distinct users over the course of the weekend. As a global platform, it’s absolutely the case that distinct user count in a 24 hour time period is higher than that. While we don’t have any official recent Monthly Active User (MAU) numbers, Valve gave a figure of about 132 MM at the end of 2021. If we scale that using the ratio of peak concurrent users then vs now, that gives an estimate of ~200MM MAU (though this is very rough) A couple of contextual comparisons: Netflix has ~300 million subscribers, about 100 million of whom are on the ad-supported tier. Uber reported ~190 million MAPC (Monthly Active Platform Consumers, i.e. “people who took a ride or bought Uber Eats delivery”) for the most recent quarter. eBay has ~135 million “Active Buyers” (defined as an account that made a purchase in the last year). Many may be surprised to learn that the Steam Machine being released in 2026 is actually Steam Machine 2.0. Valve, for its part, seems to be tacitly trying to memory-hole the earlier model; essentially none of the messaging about the new release brings up the fiasco from a decade prior. However, it’s clear that Valve has internalized a lot of the failures from that affair: It’s a perceived truism in the games industry that platform exclusives drive platform adoption. While I think this is on the whole significantly overstated, and it seems like the industry itself might be coming around on that, it’s hard to deny that the fact that many major games just didn’t run on the original Steam Machine’s software could hardly be called a selling point: Probably the biggest issue holding back the Steam Machine at launch was the [...] fact they only run games that have Linux versions. Three of the platform’s biggest titles in recent years: The Witcher 3, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Metal Gear Solid V, still aren’t supported, which is a big problem for a machine aimed at gamers. (The Steam Machine: What Went Wrong | TechSpot, 2017) Even looking at the games that were supported, they performed worse on SteamOS than they did on Windows… which ties into the next point: Steam Link, launched in 2015, allowed owners of (sufficiently powerful) PCs to stream games to the TV over your (hopefully uncluttered) WiFi network at a lower price point. What did that mean? You had two options: Purchase a new machine that cost anywhere from $500 to thousands and hook it up to your TV; or Purchase a little stick for $50 and use the PC you probably already gamed on before all this as a local server for your games. You know, that PC running Windows, which apparently runs those games better anyway. Gosh, I wonder which one consumers would want? /s For this one, I’m just going to quote directly from another publication that ran a postmortem article on all this about a decade ago: “We started thinking, ‘Hey, you know, we’re actually creating a middle-tier niche for this at this point,’” says [Michael Hoang, marketing manager @ iBuyPower]. “You have your console, you have your PC gamers, we’re right in between. We’re right in the middle where no one can really claim which one this is. So now we’re creating a new demographic that has never been created, so we have to do everything from the ground up at this point. And it was very, very hard to convince people, well, do I want to be a PC gamer? Do I want to stick with just being console? Or this new thing in the middle. (What happened to Steam Machines? | PC Gamer, originally published 2017, re-published 2018) How does this compare to the situation in 2022 (with the Steam Deck) or 2026 (Machine 2.0)? On the back of years of testing/improvements and launch of the Steam Deck, the Proton gaming compatibility layer for Linux means even some brand new games can, out of the box, often “just work” on SteamOS without tuning. ProtonDB tracks compatibility, and counts 7000+ games that are verified to work as well or almost as well as on Windows, and when sorting games by popularity on Steam (i.e. the main platform), you have to pass more than 40 at time of writing before you get one that isn’t at least “Gold” rated. While the software still technically exists and is usable, the hardware is dead, and even the software has “better” open source alternatives that are recommended by the community as the go-to solutions (ref: Moonlight/Sunshine). This one is less clear; while (at time of writing) the pricing of Steam Machine 2.0 is not confirmed, it has been stated that it won’t be sold at a loss despite only having the hardware to be performance-competitive with current-gen consoles (which are sold at a loss, and so would be expected to be cheaper). At a glance, it seems like Valve is setting themselves up for the same “are we PC gamers, console gamers, or something in the middle” question all over again. However, there’s an argument to be made that, if the Steam Deck is the iPhone of gaming, then the Steam Machine is the iPad – an interoperable, friction-free extension of the software to a new form factor, built to fulfill a complementary purpose to the Deck. Moreover, “a slightly more expensive console” is an easier sell when you can also play your games on the go with the Steam Deck, in that (again) it centralizes your library. Returning to the earlier-mentioned PC Gamer post-mortem: What’s the best thing to come of iBuyPower’s SBX? The LED strip, says Hoang, which looked really nice. Now, taking a look at the Steam Machine store page: Jokes aside, I think Valve’s biggest takeaways from the debacle that was “Steam Machine 1.0” was that, for their vision of hardware to make sense as a customer purchase, it need to be smooth; they couldn’t just ship an MVP and build on it later, or rely on third-party partners specialized in hardware to build the rig while they made the software and hope that the two would meet in the middle. No, they needed to control the hardware, the software, the interface, the messaging, everything. They learned that it all needed to “just work, seamlessly”. The parallels aren’t only in their trajectories and ultimate product offerings, though. A deeper examination of what makes these companies unique and valuable reveals more similarities, which is perhaps unsurprising considering that they are both also very, very successful. Both Jobs and Newell view(ed) digital asset piracy as a problem of availability and convenience. Jobs: We believe that 80 percent of the people stealing stuff don’t want to be; there’s just no legal alternative. So we said, Let’s create a legal alternative to this. Everybody wins. Music companies win. The artists win. Apple wins. And the user wins because he gets a better service and doesn’t have to be a thief. (Esquire Magazine Interview, 2003) Newell: “We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem,” [Newell] said. “If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate’s service is more valuable.” (2011, proxied quote from The Cambridge Student via The Escapist; thanks to teddyh on HackerNews for digging up the archive link for TCS!) This take by Newell is borne out by results, as he goes on to explain: “Prior to entering the Russian market, we were told that Russia was a waste of time because everyone would pirate our products. Russia is now about to become [Steam’s] largest market in Europe,” Newell said. While Jobs is providing an optimistic view on people’s morals and Newell is looking more clinically at overall value like an economist, they both point at the same underlying idea, i.e. “users will pay for a good experience”. We return again to Jobs’s famous refrain of “it just works” – and customers will pay you when it does. When Steve Jobs died in 2011, people left flowers at Apple stores. When Gabe Newell so much as posts on Reddit, threads debating what happens to Steam without him rack up thousands of upvotes and comments. Both companies have fanbases that behave less like customers and more like congregations. Even after almost 15 years of Tim Cook at its head, when you think “Apple”, you think of the iconic image of Steve Jobs looking directly at the camera with his hand on his chin that became the cover of Walter Isaacson’s biography. Jobs’s ideas around design as the lodestone of product development, his relentless focus on the customer experience, his love for simplicity – all of these are written into Apple’s very DNA and are the exact things customers love about their products. While the general public might not recognize the name, Gabe Newell is the same in gaming circles. One need look no further than even reactions from those fans when Gabe Newell questions his own celebrity treatment. And just like Apple, this cult-like veneration extends to the company itself – despite having been almost 20 years since the last mainline entry in the Half-Life series, memes and (half-?)jokes about “Half-Life 3 when” have not died down, and when Valve announced a prequel VR game in the series due to release in 2020, the trailer racked up 10 million views in less than 24 hours… and, of course, prompted a fresh wave of “Half-Life 3 when?” This phenomenon of fandom cannot be viewed as anything but a competitive advantage. Both companies have audiences that will literally hold off on buying things in case their “preferred” creator might enter the space, and watch their every move like hawks to determine what to “get hype” for. Valve and Apple do differ in one major respect, however: Valve seems staunchly unwilling to pursue any explicit, strong lock-in. Unlike Apple hardware, the Steam Deck does not need to be jailbroken in any way, and Valve explicitly provides a guide for how to go outside their ecosystem (and potentially brick your very expensive game machine). The messaging for the Steam Machine 2.0 seems equally “free”: Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it’s still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer? (Steam Machine product page) A useful lens for understanding the dynamics at play when talking about Valve/Steam is that of Aggregation Theory. Aggregation Theory is a model and way of thinking about businesses enabled by the Internet and digitization, conceived and coined by Ben Thompson of Stratechery. Thompson labels “Aggregators” as businesses having three core characteristics: A Direct Relationship with Users Negligible Marginal Cost for Additional Users Demand-Driven Markets with Decreasing Acquisition Costs Is that a mouthful? Yes, and the big words hide a lot of complexity. For those who want to really understand it (something I encourage, as I think that a lot of both the successes and failures in recent times of tech companies, whether in product strategy or regulation, come from a misunderstanding of these dynamics), I’d encourage going to the source and spidering out to related, mentioned articles (Thompson does such a great job at linking between his pieces that I’m tempted to provide a quasi-TVTropes warning first): https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/ https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/ However, for our purposes, I think we only need to engage with the concept at a high level. Consider AirBnB (which might not initially seem like an aggregator), an example Thompson himself brings up often. Homesharing wasn’t a new concept that sprung fully-formed from Brian Chesky’s forehead; couchsurfers and foreign exchange students engaged in it for decades. What AirBnB did was aggregate demand – they made it trivially easy to find a nice place to stay. Once enough travelers were searching on AirBnB, hosts “had to be there”. Once enough hosts were listed, why would travelers look elsewhere? The platform became the default not by being the only option, but by being the most convenient. In this regard, Steam works the same way. Steam is inarguably an aggregator, and arguably close to the platonic ideal of one: Direct Relationship with Users – As a customer, you make an account with Steam to activate products managed through it. While you don’t have to give them your payment information, it’s certainly more convenient to do so. It would almost require active commitment to avoid doing so: you’d have to exclusively buy game keys from other retailers, handle any and all in-game purchases directly with the game creators (if even possible), and deny yourself the ability to buy anything during the ever-rotating Steam Store sales that often feature deep discounts on a wide swath of games. Negligible Marginal Cost for Additional Users – Steam is a digital storefront, so yes. Additional users are just an O(1) addition of rows in a few database tables. And while Steam obviously incurs some transaction costs when users buy things, who doesn’t pay the gatekeepers of Visa and Mastercard? Demand-Driven with Decreasing Acquisition Costs – Steam is practically self-sustaining on both sides of its market. Customers not already on Steam are liable to wind up there by accident just buying a box copy of some game or another. That mass of users attracts developers, both small and large, even ones that left believing their fans would follow. As a platform, Steam is also increasing lock-in: SteamVR serves as the “platform” for VR development, driven by customer demand for Half-Life: Alyx, with the Steam Frame as the first-party platform (alongside already-existing VR hardware options like HTC Vive or Oculus Quest) The Steam Deck functions as the “iPhone for PC gaming” (direct quote from GabeN)... And now comes the Steam Machine to complete a “hardware trifecta” to mirror the iPad. All of these hardware offerings are undergirded by the self-lock-in of users who have a significant portion (sometimes a supermajority) of their gaming libraries in Steam, which is (currently) non-transferable (c.f. iTunes/App Store/iCloud) In this light, the parallels to Apple are hard not to see, but Apple “integrated forward” – they created great hardware that brought customers to them first, then slowly built the pretty walls around the garden users had entered, even as the garden itself expanded into new domains like mobile and watches. Valve, by contrast “integrated backward” – they created the ecosystem first, offering both customers and developers amenities like managed updates, cloud saves, mod hosting, and content distribution networks before creating their own first-party hardware that leverages all that work. A core contributor to the success of both Apple and Valve is that they both grew naturally (if in inverse directions): Apple went from PCs, to laptops, to portable music, to smartphones as a generalization of their learnings from ‘portable music’, and finally to the modern ecosystem of software & peripherals (watches, headphones, VR). Valve started in video games, then made a game launcher/update manager for their games, then offered that update management service to other developers with a storefront before finally getting to the hardware. At each step, both companies responded to real market demand and simply did a better job at capturing that demand through UX. You can even see the proof by contradiction: The Steam Machine 1.0 shows where they perhaps moved too early or chased illusory demand, and a similar story may be repeating itself with Apple Vision. It’s instructive to contrast this with Facebook’s “all-in” pivot to metaverse. At first blush, there are significant parallels to Valve, in that both Zuckerberg and Newell had built their fiefdoms in the lands of other empires and were trying to “escape their jailers”: Newell was trying to get out of “Windows 8 jail” and the potential that Microsoft might smother their business with expansion of the Xbox business. Zuckerberg wanted to leave the Apple/Google app platforms of iOS and Android, where their decisions around privacy could kneecap FB profits (ref: iOS’s App Tracking Transparency initiative), and run his own platform from which to derive value (or, being more cynical, collect rent). However, it’s hard to imagine a bigger gap in outcomes between the two. Looking at the result of Facebook’s metaverse efforts in December 2025: A stagnant Quest store/ecosystem 70 billion dollars in losses associated with the pivot 4 years invested for no meaningful revenue growth Planned 10-30% cuts to Metaverse Perhaps most depressingly, investors drove stock 3-5% higher following release of news, indicating they were also fed up with this nonsense. Why? Well, Zuckerberg’s big pivot was completely unbacked in demand, whether from customers or enterprises, to match the scale of the investment he decided to fling at it. Moreover, it had an at-best tenuous connection to the core competencies that Facebook had developed in scalable software, social networks, and advertising. Zuckerberg often talked about how everyone would interact with virtual avatars while on the go or in meetings across timezones or what have you, and how that tied into Facebook’s mission of connecting people, but as the saying goes: if you need to explain the joke, it isn’t funny. All of this analysis begs the question: What sayeth the crystal balls? If we’re looking at things as Aggregation Theorists, continued near-total monopoly is the obvious end result, absent significant developments: What is important to note is that in all of these examples there are strong winner-take-all effects. All of the examples I listed are not only capable of serving all consumers/users, but they also become better services the more consumers/users they serve — and they are all capable of serving every consumer/user on earth. (Aggregation Theory | Stratechery, 2015) Competition is difficult once a big aggregator has emerged, even for deep-pocketed incumbents. One need only look at famous examples like Yahoo or Bing vs Google, or Walmart vs Amazon. Epic Games already tries to offer competition in digital storefronts by leveraging the breakout success of Fortnite to launch their Epic Games Store, with a more generous revenue split for developers and the backing of Tencent to buy up store exclusives (even if timed only) by flinging money around. However, 7 years into the experiment, these terms don’t seem to have resulted in any significant upturning of the apple cart. Ben Thompson (of Stratechery) suggests that traditional platforms might offer an avenue by which competition can rise, looking at Shopify vis a vis Amazon. However, it’s unclear what “a platform approach” might look like as competition in the context of gaming here. Indeed, if you asked me what an extensible platform might look like in gaming, I’d say that Valve are, themselves, operating closer to a platform than a straightforward aggregator by making Proton/SteamOS free for other companies to use and potentially develop on top of (ref: Lenovo Legion Go S and ASUS ROG Ally as competitors to Steam Deck that can use Proton/SteamOS (though by default ship with Windows 11)). So, if the traditional mechanisms of the market find no purchase, might we look elsewhere? Antitrust is also hard, at least based on dominant US thought. Those who know me personally will know that I’ve long railed against Robert Bork’s consumer welfare standard for evaluating mergers and antitrust. I’m hardly the first or alone in this – perhaps most notably, former FTC Chair and current Mamdani transition team member Lina Khan first made her name penning “The Amazon Antitrust Paradox” as a direct refutation of Bork’s ideas. However, despite some recent small shifts suggesting that the climate may be changing, it remains the default standard, and considering that users specifically choose to go to the aggregators due to the benefits they offer (whether on price or quality), consumer welfare seems unlikely to find any justification for action. However, there are potential avenues in forced service interoperability and data portability. In short, the idea is that regulations can mandate that platforms of sufficient size have to allow other services to be able to integrate in some (perhaps standardized, limited) ways with the incumbent giants. This is an idea that’s already being trialed by the EU via the Digital Markets Act (DMA) for messaging (even despite some real and valid technical concerns), and it’s also being partially (voluntarily, seemingly) rolled out in music streaming apps (specifically between Apple Music and YouTube Music). While it’s early days, if these initial forays work without significant snags, it may embolden other legislatures to make similar moves that ultimately wind up hitting Steam, forcing it to cooperate with EGS in some way like allowing Steam users to take their validly purchased games to EGS if they want. Cory Doctorow’s pithy (if crude) term and model, which posits that platforms are eventually incentivized to ruin the experience for everyone on them in search of profit, might credibly be argued to be the end state of all platforms controlled by profit-seeking entities. And arguably, Steam has long since been “enshittified” in some regards. The deluge of games on the store that are approved for release without quality control has led to cheap, buggy messes or even outright malware finding their way onto customer machines. This is not a new problem, either, with industry analyst and pundit James Stephanie Sterling having coined the term “the asset flip” in 2015 to describe a problem that has only grown in scope since. However, while that criticism might hold water for some industry professionals, power-users, and gaming enthusiasts who want to find “hidden gems”, for the average consumer, Steam generally remains a good experience for discovery, purchase, and library management. Looking forward, as a private company that is majority owned by Gabe Newell himself, Valve is not as vulnerable to the kinds of short-term shareholder pressures that public companies or heavily venture-funded companies like Facebook/Bytedance face. While that alone is no guarantee, the combination of profitability, patient capital, and founder control may stave off the specter of enshittification for some time yet, at least while current leadership remains. That is, however, also why, as mentioned earlier, many fans fret about what might happen to Steam and Valve in the absence of GabeN. While it’s hard to say what direction technology might go in the future (who could’ve predicted in Oct 2022 that the US economy’s growth would hinge on LLMs?), there is one obvious avenue that may pose a threat: Cloud Gaming is only getting better. Surfaces like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now are currently only either technological solutions that allow access to existing libraries (e.g. Steam or EGS via Nvidia GeForce Now) or Netflix-esque “subscription packages” for pre-selected games. However, there’s no technological reason preventing these providers from attempting to fight with Steam as a digital storefront; Google Stadia already tried this in a form, and while that service was eventually shut down, there’s nothing to suggest that the idea itself is inherently unworkable. If these services want to become “the Uber for gaming”, a storefront may eventually be a necessity; many of these services already have experimented with messaging of “pay-as-you-go” for gaming hardware, gesturing at a future where you never have to worry about hardware compatibility or drivers because it “runs in the cloud”, all of which is reminiscent of the “you won’t need to own a car, a self-driving one will just come pick you up” vision pitched by Uber or Tesla in years past. If you were to ask me where things likely go from here, I’d say Valve will remain the much-beloved de facto king of PC gaming for the foreseeable future. This isn’t because they’re inherently more talented or virtuous, but because the factors for decay just aren’t there. They’re private, they’re profitable, and (if nothing else) they’re patient (Half-Life 3 when, GabeN?). There’s no strong incentive for them to enshittify. The parallel to Apple isn’t perfect, though; the companies have taken different directions in some aspects. The more open approach Valve has taken with Proton and SteamOS is perhaps the most obvious, and I personally consider that to be a strength, especially in the context of regulation. However, there are other differences as well, and the one that stands out to me is in social infrastructure. If I say “blue and green bubbles”, the direction I’m pointing at should become clear. Apple has leveraged their branding and dominant position (at least within the US) to elevate the iPhone to a status symbol, and in so doing has created network effects through iMessage and Facetime that further keeps their customers within their ecosystem in a way akin to traditional social networks (“I can’t leave Facebook; that’s how I keep in touch with my high school buddies!”). By contrast, while Steam does have chat and groups and forums and other social features, calling them “anemic” might be generous. When it comes to PC gaming, while most things make you think Valve and Steam, if you talk about social lock-in, it’s Discord that comes to mind, and that’s a chink in the fortress Valve has built. The question is, will social infrastructure be as critical in gaming platform lock-in as it has been to mobile? If Apple’s trajectory is any guide – iMessage didn’t seem critical until it revealed itself as one of their strongest moats – owning the social layer may matter more than is obvious today.

Transcripts may contain a few typos. With many episodes lasting 2+ hours, it can be difficult to catch minor errors. Enjoy! Tim Ferriss: Bill, great to see you, man. Bill Gurley: Good to see you. Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator.
