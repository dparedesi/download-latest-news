Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman on zoning, generational inequality, and how to fix the U.S. housing market. Plus: What Trump gets dangerously wrong about World War II. Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts On this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum opens with reflections on the upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and what Donald Trump’s recent statements about “Victory Day” reveal about how America is forgetting the meaning of peace, cooperation, and democratic leadership. Then David is joined by Glenn Kelman, the CEO of Redfin, for a candid look at the broken state of the U.S. housing market. Kelman explains why both buyers and sellers are miserable, how pandemic-era mortgage rates have frozen supply, and why the next generation is increasingly stuck, unable to buy, and often unable to move. They discuss zoning reform, immigration, housing deterioration, and why, despite the bleak outlook, Kelman still believes there’s hope for long-term correction—if America can relearn how to build. The following is a transcript of the episode: David Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest today will be Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin, an online real-estate-brokerage service, and our topic will be the state of the U.S. housing market. Before my dialogue with Glenn, I want to offer some thoughts on quite a different subject: the impending 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On August 15th, 1945, the imperial Japanese government communicated its surrender to the United States and the allies in the Pacific War. That ceremony was formalized with a ceremony in Tokyo Bay on September 2nd, bringing the war to its legal conclusion. The United States and every belligerent in the war have observed many commemorations of this immense event. As the commemorations have extended in time away from the events that they commemorate, a kind of vainglorious note has tended to enter into these commemorations, never more so than in the message President Trump issued on the 80th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. I quote from his Truth Social account: “Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II. I am hereby renaming May 8th as Victory Day for World War II and November 11th as Victory Day for World War I. We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything — That’s because we don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!” Now, it’s kind of news that the United States never celebrated V-E Day or V-J Day before Donald Trump came along. Of course it did. But it is true that in the past, these celebrations were always muted with a remembrance of the terrible suffering that the wars brought to those who fought them, the terrible damage they did to the world, the terrible unnecessariness of the wars, and the hopes for lasting peace. But as we get more distant, there has been a tendency—and Donald Trump expresses it more than anyone—to think of World War II as a kind of military Super Bowl in which the United States and a bunch of teams competed. The United States won the trophy. They had the biggest point spread. They had the fanciest jerseys, the prettiest cheerleaders, and so yay, us. I think as we approach this anniversary, that way of thinking seems even more unhelpful than at any time in the past. The thing I’d like to commemorate on this 80th anniversary is not the war that ended on August 15th, but the peace that began on August 15th. The long peace in Atlantic and Pacific—nervous intended of its start, overshadowed by the threat of nuclear destruction of the Cold War, but building and growing and enhancing the lives of people whose parents and grandparents had been on both sides of the war. Victors and vanquished, Allies and Axis found a way to come together and to build reconciliation, to build a new kind of world. And American leadership was absolutely crucial to the building of this world—the American leadership in providing aid to the war-ravaged countries of Europe and Asia. The American guarantee of security that was tested in Asia, Korea, and Vietnam, that was tested in Europe and periodic crises over the city of Berlin. That was backed by American strength and power and supported by a growing number of allies, increasingly democratic allies. The triumph of bringing to democracy countries that had been non-democracies during the war, countries like Portugal or South Korea that had been American allies but began not as democracies, but achieved democratic government. All of this, supported and paid for by the mounting prosperity achieved by the free-trade system that was built by American leadership in the world after World War II. And all of these accomplishments are things that have now been put at risk. As they’re put at risk, I think if we remember the end of the war, we need to remember also the beginning of the war. The American role in the years before 1945 was not as magnificent, not as glorious, not as something to be proud of as the American role in the war and afterwards. The war was made inevitable by a lot of bad American decisions in the 1920s and was nearly lost because of even worse American decisions in the 1930s and ’40s. Trade protectionism, isolationism, indifference to the fate of struggling democracies: Those are part of the American story too. And while the heroic achievements of the years after the war—the turn to free trade and collective security—those are receding, the mistakes that brought the war into being, those are being repeated. In 2025, America is less the country it was in 1945 and much more the country it was in 1925 and 1935. It is funny that Donald Trump is taking credit for a victory that was only made necessary because people did the things that were recommended by the presidency of Donald Trump. The greatest accomplishment of the United States in its history was the peace built after 1945. I think that is the thing that together with Japanese, together with Germans, together with all the defeated, together with the British and the French and the Canadians and the Australians and all those who helped to win, we want this war to recede into history. We want only its lessons to remain alive. Its lessons of cooperation, collective security, democracy of trade. If those lessons are at risk, we need to reaffirm them. That’s the message for this day, not boasting. Every time Donald Trump speaks of war, I think of a poem by Rudyard Kipling called “Recessional,” and there’s a line in that poem that haunts me because it seems to describe so well our present situation. Kipling wrote—he was addressing a prayer to the god of armies. He said: “If, drunk with sight of power, we loose wild tongues that have not Thee in awe.” I think the America of Donald Trump is a little drunk with power. And even as that power is waning, it is loosing wilder and wilder tongues than ever. And it’s not keeping in awe this divine spirit, the spirit of justice and reconciliation that is the thing that I will be thinking about on August 15th of 2025. And now my conversation with Glenn Kelman. But first, a quick break. [Music] Frum: Glenn Kelman is the CEO of Redfin, an online home-brokerage service. Prior to joining Redfin, he was a co-founder of Plumtree Software, a publicly traded company that created the enterprise-portal-software market. Glenn was raised in Seattle and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. Glenn, thank you so much for joining The David Frum Show today. Glenn Kelman: So excited to be here. Thanks for having me, David. Frum: Oh, so, so grateful to you. So let’s just start with the open-end question: What is going on in the housing market? We’ve had a terrible spring. There’s more bad economic news this summer. What’s the state of the housing market? Kelman: Home prices are softening. So for the first time in nearly a decade, home prices seem likely to soften in the second half of the year. Interest rates may go down just because the jobs news was weak, and that would be a welcome respite, but inventory has been very low for a long time. Sales volume has been extremely low, probably 30 percent below historic levels on a per-capita basis. We haven’t seen this sales volume since 1997, when the United States population was about 30 percent smaller. So the market has been moribund, but home prices have held up, and we’re going to see that in the June numbers. But if you look further ahead, 35 percent of listings are staying on the market for more than 90 days. We have many unsold listings right now. It has just gotten hard to sell a house, especially in the Sun Belt, and so that may bring some relief to homebuyers who really need it. The average age of the first-time homebuyer is 38. It used to be 31 just a decade ago. Frum: Well, one of the things that is strange, and you’re sort of anticipating the question is, this is a market that is experienced as a bad market, both by sellers and by buyers. Kelman: Mm-hmm. Frum: And normally, at least one of those two groups is happy. Bad news for sellers, good news for buyers. Bad news for buyers, good news for sellers. Now, they both seem unhappy that the prices are high. Buyers can’t buy, but the buyers aren’t there, so sellers can’t sell. Everybody’s miserable. That doesn’t seem like an equilibrium state. Kelman: No, it isn’t. I think we’re at an inflection point. So mostly people who have had to sell their home have been able to do so quite easily over the past two or three years. So even in the post-pandemic correction, it was fairly straightforward. But now home sellers are struggling, especially people who bought a house during the pandemic. We are talking to them about lowering their price and they can’t, because they’ll be short on their mortgage. Now, we’re not going to have anything like the great financial crisis in 2008, where there was a wave of foreclosures. But for a particular population of folks who did buy during the pandemic, it has suddenly gotten very hard to sell their home and pay off their mortgage. And so right now the market is just teetering in a very unhappy equilibrium. I think that prices will come down, and I’m one of the people who views that as good news. When bread prices come down, when gas prices come down, most Americans view that as cause for celebration. But when home prices go down, about half of us are worried about it and the other half are throwing a party. And really, for the younger generation, we need prices to come down. Frum: Well, is the cause of the misery that the people who bought during the pandemic and a lot of people were buying with money that was almost free? Very, very low interest rates? Kelman: Yeah. Frum: And now it’s five years on and the cheapest money is the five-year interest rate that resets after year five, and those people are now thinking about selling, but they’re selling to people who have to go borrow at real interest rates. And so that’s the mismatch. The secret is one group has a low monthly payment, but wants to sell the house at a high price. The other group has a high monthly payment and cannot possibly meet the price. And that’s the mismatch and that’s why everybody’s miserable. Kelman: That is a huge part of it. So about 75 percent of American homeowners have a mortgage below 5 percent. We’re unlikely to see a rate like that anytime in the foreseeable future, and so those folks create this rate-locked inventory. Many, many people in America—more than half of all Americans—really couldn’t afford to buy their own home at current interest rates. So it’s very common for us to go to a listing consultation with someone who has had another baby or is going through a divorce, had some kind of life event where they need to move, and when they realize what they’re going to be able to afford from the sale of their home, they decide to stay put instead. Frum: Let’s go around the country, and let’s start in what it’s like—what I understand, like what the Dust Bowl was during the Great Depression, Florida is to today’s real-estate market. It is just the endless source of bad news. So tell us the story of Florida, and then let’s go around the rest of the country. Kelman: Well, Florida has all kinds of problems, and some of them are climate change–related because insurance rates are shooting through the roof. So, so many buyers in Florida get a home, get a mortgage, and they think that’s all there is to it, and usually that’s the case. But now there’s a third rail, which is getting insurance, and because there have been so many storms, insurance rates are sky-high. The state has tried to regulate that to some degree, but it’s really a triple whammy. Because home prices have gone up; many people are moving into the state. That has started to slow. Florida has always been a real-estate-driven economy, so the overall economy struggles when real estate struggles like no other state in America, and that just makes it extremely volatile, especially condos in Florida right now. Very hard to sell. So there are places where it’s still easy to sell a home in Florida, but those are getting more scarce, driven by those three factors. Frum: What’s the strongest real-estate market in the country? Kelman: Strongest real-estate market in the country is probably in the Midwest right now. It just saw less volatility than before. So if you went to a place like Austin, Texas, somewhere in the Sun Belt, home prices went up 40 or 50 percent during the pandemic and then came crashing down. But a place like Chicago has been very Midwest and stylish as you would expect Chicago to be, and so that market has been holding up. I think it’s some of the markets where we saw the biggest pandemic highs that we’re now seeing the most volatility. West Coast markets are doing better because there were a bunch of Amazon workers or Google workers who thought they could move to Texas and keep their jobs, and now they’re being called back to the states. And so this exodus that we saw from California and Washington State is now reversing, and that is supporting the market. If I had to say the biggest split in the market right now, condos are just always more volatile than houses. Townhouses are also much more volatile. Those are the first parts of the market to go. Builders are really struggling right now. Yeah, so the incentives that they’re offering the homebuyer usually involve buying down the rate, and then they’re offering 5 or 6 percent to a buyer’s agent, when normally it would be 2 or 3 percent. That’s an incentive that the consumer herself doesn’t see. It’s an indication that home-builder sentiment is very negative. I think it’s been negative for 15 months. They’ve got their own double whammy where consumer demand is softening, but also their labor supply is shrinking. Frum: Well, let’s talk to the generational aspect because that’s probably one of the most socially debilitating. So you said, a decade ago the first-time homebuyer averaged 31 years old. Today, the first-time home—how old, say it again? Kelman: Thirty-eight. Frum: Thirty-eight. So let’s talk to those 29- and 30-year-olds who said, I thought I was one year away from buying a house, and now I discover I’m nearly a decade away. I’d like to have a house when I’m of age to have children. What hope is there for me? What hope is there for them? Kelman: Well, we just need a correction with a correction. So we already talked about this phenomenon where home sales plunged at the end of 2022, but home prices kept increasing, and that was because all this inventory was rate-locked, and now we’re starting to see inventory pile up. It’s getting harder to sell a home. We think prices will go down by at least 1 percent in the second half of the year, and that means that homebuyers may catch a break, but 1 percent probably isn’t enough. The second part of this is that there just has to be a building boom. There’s this big debate on the left about whether or not we should continue with the current policies or be much more permissive about building not just houses, but nuclear power plants and high-speed rail and all sorts of other projects to bring the American economy forward. I will be quite explicit about this. I am a “yes, in my backyard,” YIMBY kind of politician. I really think America has to be good at building houses or the next generation is really gonna be in a pickle. We always talked about “the bad vibes economy,” where Joe Biden wondered, Why are people so down on the economy, especially this younger generation, and it’s just hard to be optimistic about the economy, even when unemployment is low, if you’re living in your parents’ basement. And so I see some hope—Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren, unlikely bedfellows, are now sponsoring a bill to lower housing regulation and to get more homes built. It passed through the banking committee on a unanimous vote. It’s something that I think the president could really get behind. I had hoped when he started his term, that because he’s a builder, he could be the builder in chief or the developer in chief. Mostly he has not addressed this issue. Frum: You believe that Donald Trump is a builder? Kelman: David. Are you trying to get me in trouble? I do not think— Frum: He’s a name licenser. He’s not a builder. When was the last time Donald Trump built anything? Like, 1980? Kelman: I think he has an enthusiasm for construction. Frum: Yes. Yes. Kelman: Regardless of his bona fides— Frum: He draws—those are his favorite doodles. Kelman: Yes. (Laughs.) Frum: He draws skylines. (Laughs.) Kelman: They are his favorite doodles. Frum: And writes his name on— (Laughs.) Kelman: It’s the White House right now. He wants to build another room in the White House. I know it’s going to have this Louis Quatorze kind of vibe, but, nonetheless— Frum: Louis Quatorze at Las Vegas. But okay, we’re not going down the politics path. I just want to hear more hope for the young. Because even if the day of the 2.75 percent mortgage is not returning soon—and that was a trap, by the way. The way you got 2.75 percent was by saying, I’m signing up for five years, and then letting the interest rate reset, which is not advice that anybody should, any young person who doesn’t have a lot of other resources should be following. You want the length of your loan to be the length of time you’re going to own the home. The depression generation knew that. But anyway, 2.75 money, or even 3.25—we’re not going to see that in the mortgage market so soon, even if the overnight rates come down. So, what’s the hope for the young? What’s the hope for the young? Kelman: I think the hope for the young is that mayors have been losing their jobs over housing. If you look in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, there has been so much rage over the high cost of housing that it has really shifted the politics. There have been a bunch of state bills in California that failed five years ago that made it easier to build housing, made it easier to build accessory dwelling units, lifted parking requirements, and other things that dwindled the supply of housing in California. And now that state has gotten religion about trying to get builders back to increase the supply of housing. So I think there’s just a new political movement. It is a bipartisan issue on the left and the right. At the local level, especially, there has just been this religion that we have to make it easier to build houses and increase the supply of homes. We are probably 4 million, 5 million units short of where we need to be, just given the demographics. Frum: Yeah. Well, if we were having this discussion 10 years ago, 2015, what we would’ve said is, The outlook for housing is exciting because the autonomous vehicle is almost here. And when it gets here, people won’t need to have their own individual parking places anymore because these autonomous vehicles will be rolling around the city. It’ll be robot Uber for everybody, at least in any major place that’s got any population density. You’ll press the button for the robot Uber, it’ll be there in eight minutes, and you will not need a parking space and that will cut $40,000 or $50,000 off the price of a condo. What has happened to that hope? Kelman: Mania. So, the classic realtor move when you can’t afford to live in the city is to look in the suburbs and then to look in the exurbs, so people’s commutes just get longer and longer and longer. And at some point the rubber band always breaks, where people just aren’t willing to live in New Jersey and commute into Manhattan. But now because of Zoom and maybe because of autonomous vehicles, at some point we are going to see people who are more tolerant of longer commutes. We have certainly had these conversations with customers and been surprised. There are people living in Sacramento who commute into San Francisco, and that’s because they’re only coming to work a couple of days a week. But it’s also because the cost of housing is just insane in San Francisco. And I think there’s probably a broader trend here, which is that it used to be that the politics of housing were toxic in San Francisco, New York, LA, and Seattle. But if you went to Indiana or Chicago or Florida, there it was still possible to work a middle-class job and get a starter home. So the American dream died in different places at different rates until the pandemic, and then all of a sudden you saw LA’s housing problem come to Indiana, where people showed up with Monopoly money from LA saying, I don’t care if the house is $300,000 or $500,000; it’s easy for me to afford. And so I think now the housing crisis isn’t just a local political issue; it’s a national political issue, and it did, I think, contribute to some of the economic anxiety that was nationwide. Previously, I think you felt like if you were living in San Francisco, your kids had to go to Harvard and then to Yale and major in computer science and get a job at Google and become a VP if they had any hope of buying a house in the same city they were raised in. Now I think that anxiety has spread to other parts of the country, and that’s why I think there’s a broader consensus that we need to do something about housing in America. We need to build more housing. We need to deregulate a little bit. Frum: Well, from your vantage point, as the intermediary between buyers and sellers—if I said, Okay, we got the governors of the states here, with their notepads open, ready to take dictation, what are the top two, three, even four steps you’d recommend to make it easier to buy, build housing, and make housing cheaper? Kelman: Almost all zoning laws. So zoning. Frum: Be specific. What would you change? Kelman: Well—and this is an issue where I think Donald Trump has been on the wrong side of the issue—but some places only allow single-family homes, so they don’t allow density. You can’t build an apartment building. You can’t build a condo building, and that’s because rich people like to have less density, fewer cars on the road. There’s a certain kind of neighborhood that’s a leafy neighborhood. And so in the past you would see Republican homeowners really argue for zoning laws that made it very difficult to build a house. And then on the left, the issue that people really fought for were some kinds of rent controls, which discouraged us from building rental housing. And so the zoning laws that were popular on the right, the rental controls that were popular on the left—both of those need to go. We’ve already talked about the parking minimums, but mostly it’s just the approval times. So if you talk to builders, they will say that it’s just so much easier to build a house in Arizona than it is in California even though the housing shortage is so much more severe in California. And if you look at what drove California’s boom, Orange County used to be orange groves, and then the city made some unholy alliance with the builder to turn the whole thing into a suburb, and they built houses faster than at any point in America. And I just think, we may not need that rate, but we need something like it if we are to give hope to a new generation of Americans. My broader argument is that I think this will be good, not just for housing, but I do think we need to upgrade the American economy so that it’s ready for the 21st century. And if we are going to do that, we need to start saying yes to solar and wind and nuclear power, to high-speed rail, and all sorts of other projects. Liberal cities are going to fail if they can’t get stuff done. And the sharp end of that spear has been this YIMBY movement. This “yes, in my backyard” movement. So I think that’s the hope for progressive politics. Frum: I think one of the things that people often lose sight of—we talk about housing building. People don’t understand that houses fall apart. We lose housing every year, a certain percentage. It’s a physical asset; it deteriorates over time. And so the idea that—and this is the thing that I think the rent controls understand—that the housing is dropping out of the market all the time because it’s aged; it’s dilapidated. And you either need to tear it down and build something new or you need to invest, in order to upgrade it. But in either case, you don’t just build once and then forget. And the owner isn’t just clipping coupons. The owner is having to, if you want to maintain that unit, actively reinvest all the time to maintain its quality. And so it’s not just build and forget. One of the reasons that you could be able to say, Well, we don’t have a lot of natural population growth. Immigration is slowing down; why 4 or 5 million units? You see this in big cities. A lot of things are just dropping out of the market. The building falls down. There’s a number—I’m going to forget what it is—of the number of apartments in New York that are rent-stabilized and vacant. The building is beneath the city’s code, and so it’s not allowed to be inhabited, but the landlord can’t afford to renovate it because it’s rent stable, and that’s tens of thousands of units in the city of New York. Now, not everybody has crazy rent-stabilization schemes, but everybody has the problem of housing deterioration, which is not something that I think that a lot of people in the YIMBY argument world—the YIMBY people might get it—but not everyone understands. Or remembers, I should say. People understand it once you explain it. Kelman: One thing that people forget about home-price corrections is that it’s not just that the same asset is selling for less money because of the laws of supply and demand; that happens, but if you looked in past corrections like 2008, 2009, and actually walked through the houses, you would see that they were run-down, that nobody had lived in them for six or 12 months, that there had been a foreclosure. So the actual quality of these housing assets across America declined even as the price for the same house also declined. So there were two factors that drove this wealth destruction during the last major price correction, which was in the great financial crisis. And so now, if you look at what the mayor of Detroit has been talking about, there are taxes for investors who own blighted properties. It’s sort of a use-it-or-lose-it tax—that you have to invest to make the property really livable or you have to sell it because there’s sort of a vacant-property tax that’s quite punitive. Frum: And so that forces turnover in the marketplace. Kelman: Yeah. And I think there’s a broader issue here. Of course I’m an advocate for turnover in the marketplace because we’re a brokerage and we make money every time there’s a trade, but to me it’s bigger than that. What has made the American experiment so dynamic is this idea that when Flint, Michigan, goes through a downturn because we’re just not making as many cars as we used to in America, people eventually move. That is the story of the Okies going to California in a John Steinbeck novel. But if you look at the likelihood that an American will live and die in the same town in which he was born, that has actually increased. Frum: My Atlantic colleague Yoni Appelbaum has a very important book about this called Stuck. Kelman: Yeah. Frum: I think the figure that Yoni cites is—now, we’re an older country than we used to be, on average, so you’d expect a little less movement. If you adjust for age, if you look at people in the equivalent age group, an American is about—if I remember Yoni’s book correctly—about half as likely to move at their peak moving years than a comparable American was in the 1980s. We’re not talking about pioneer days, we’re talking about the 1980s, when there were personal computers and airbags in cars and— Kelman: (Laughs.) It’s not so long ago! We were both alive then. Frum: A lot of channels on TV. Disco was dead already. (Laughs.) And in the 1980s, Americans at the peak years of moving were twice as likely to move as Americans—and housing prices have to be a huge part because once you get a house, you think, and especially when you move from a depressed area to a thriving area, that the housing hit that you have to take to move from Flint to wherever the jobs are today is so terrible that people say, Well, here in Flint I may not have a job; at least I have a roof. Kelman: Yeah, and here’s where I really will be teaching my book. Redfin exists to lower the fees paid to a real-estate agent. If you couple the fees paid to an agent with the lender fees and the title and escrow fees, it’s about half of your down payment, and so there’s this conventional wisdom that you need to live at a house for seven years before you offset those fees and get the appreciation necessary to make it a profitable decision to own a home. And those fees should be half of what they are. If you look at what it costs to trade a stock or what it costs to trade almost any other asset, all markets have become more liquid except the real-estate market. And real-estate liquidity is more important to American society because it determines where we live, where we send our kids to school, who our neighbors are. The demographics of the country are really stuck. Frum: There is a lot of inefficiency in the housing market. And that can be fixed by technology and transparency. Kelman: I think so. It’s been a slow road to make real estate more efficient, because it’s a cooperative industry. So what that means is that you have one agent representing the seller and another agent representing the buyer. And if you were to replace one of those real-estate agents with some kind of chatbot, I think the other would take offense. And so nobody wants a disruptive real-estate agent, because you worry that somehow you’ll lose access to the club, and it still is a club that’s running the U.S. housing market, that gates access to the most exclusive listings in the best neighborhoods. And so I think people are very risk averse. Homebuyers are very risk averse about working with different types of real-estate agents. And I am not one who thinks that the real-estate agent will be automated out of existence—I tried to do that when I first got into this business—but I do think that technology can make the process much more efficient. Redfin has proved that in part. We charge half the fee. Our agents are three times more productive, but we still only have about 1 percent market share, and that’s because people are skittish—skittish about working with a different kind of real-estate agent. Frum: Yeah. As we wind this up, I want to deal with an argument that you hear a lot if you like the work of Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein. You’ve seen them caught up to this argument with people who want to personalize the problems in the real-estate market and say, The problem here is not zoning laws. The problem is not interest rates. The problem is that builders are greedy. They’re wicked people, and they’re colluding in wicked ways to make housing less available to others. And this is ultimately a cause for moral reform rather than technical reform. I’ve put that in a kind of unsympathetic way because it’s pretty obvious I don’t think much of the argument, but let’s hear from someone who’s there and knows. Is there any possible truth to the argument that what is going on here is some kind of conspiracy by home builders to oppress America? Kelman: (Laughs.) I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve been to home-builder conferences and it’s a bunch of guys wearing cowboy boots. Most of them are Republicans. But they are trying to make money, and the way that they make money is by building more houses, and they are very much in favor of trying to build as many houses as they can. So I think there’s some hostility to rent controls because it makes it harder to build properties for rent. But mostly these are people who are very pro-immigration. These are people who are very pro-housing. They got their clock cleaned in 2007 because they were building a massive number of units at very low price points with very skinny margins. And you just have to have a little bit of sympathy for them. They’re making a bet 18 to 36 months in advance of the demand. They have to buy the land; they have to get all the materials; they have to get the labor and build the house—and to stick their neck out that far, they have to believe that they’re going to be able to get the project done. And so when they encounter political resistance to that, they simply build somewhere else. That’s why there’s been so much construction in Florida and Texas and less in some progressive states. And so I do think, you know, the Derek Thompson, Ezra Klein argument that we should judge liberal governance by its ability to actually get things done and the simplest way to lower housing prices is to bring those builders back—there’s no conspiracy here. They’re just trying to figure out where they can build properties. Frum: Let me finish by asking you a little bit about change in the—if we think of the house as a technology, it’s an especially conservative technology. Human life changes rapidly, but people still want dining rooms or think they do, even though they don’t eat in dining rooms anymore. They want a lawn, even as it becomes ever more unaffordable and difficult to maintain and even as they move to climates where lawns don’t make sense. A lawn in Arizona—tough problem. We talked about the possible elimination—of how the autonomous car might liberate us from the need to have a parking spot for every high-rise unit. If there are autonomous cars and you don’t need to own your own car, you don’t need the parking spot. Are there other places where the technology of the house, as we know it, could change? I mean, do you put any stock on this idea that young people might be attracted to a kind of, like, clubhouse living where you own your bedroom, you own your bathroom, but you don’t necessarily own your kitchen or your public spaces? Do any of those technologies hold promise or do you think that’s a lot of lifestyle-section talk that people—in the end, people want the house that they grew up in? Kelman: I do think it’s a bunch of baloney. You hear about it every once in a while, and I’m just too old, David. I think that people say that they’re open to all sorts of alternative living arrangements, and then they have a couple of kids and they want the same thing that everybody else does. So the change in the floor plan that we’ve seen has been the second master bedroom because so many people now have their parents helping them raise their kids, helping them buy the house. There’s a lot of nepo homebuyers where the parents kicked in half the down payment and they just have an extra bedroom because they spend months of the year with that family helping to raise the kids. So that’s maybe the only major change in the floor plan. And then the change in the process is, you should just remember that as we talk about how to bring manufacturing back to America, there is one asset that has to be manufactured in America. It’s 20 percent of GDP, and it is the house. There are different parties that have tried to do more of the construction in a factory where the house is built in one place and then shipped very short distances because the shipping is so expensive. But the cost of construction and the speed of construction come down. It’s using lasers and all sorts of other computer data and engineering techniques to build actually higher-quality housing, where it’s just to a higher degree of precision. There’s just so much that we could do if we just made it easier to build houses. I think we could lower the cost. And, of course, the offset on that has just been the labor. It is a real issue that many of the people who build houses in America come from south of the border. And I have wondered—because the new immigration policies—if we are going to see, especially as we talk about AI and worry that men, especially, can’t find the kinds of jobs we had 50 years ago, if more traditional Americans, nonimmigrant Americans are going to move into the construction industry. But that is going to be an issue. We’ll see how it goes. Frum: Is there an immediate effect of immigration pending that rotation of the labor market? There are sections of the house-building process that, as I read it, are more immigrant driven than others. Like, roofers are more likely to be immigrants, especially illegal immigrants. Drywalling is very much an—and part of that, it should be said and to understand here what’s going on, the dangerousness of the roofing job, which is one of the most dangerous jobs in America. And so that tends to be that—and this is where there is maybe a moral story—that you can invest in making the roofing process safer, or you can hire somebody who, if injured, has no right to complain. And a lot of builders are attracted to option B. And by the way, a lot of buyers are voting with their dollars to tell the builder, Don’t invest in the cost of making the roofing process safer. Just hire someone who can’t complain if he’s hurt. Kelman: Yeah, well, I hope that isn’t the only solution. I don’t know that it’s just danger or even low wages or the willingness to do hard work. There are also craft-level jobs that have been staffed by immigrants—so people who make cabinets, people who do electricity. Americans aren’t going into trades at the levels that they once did, and I think we should just account, at least for a moment, for the impact that tariffs have on housing. It’s not just lumber; it’s appliances. It’s a wide range of goods that are imported from outside the country to build the house. And so it’s just a tough time to be a builder right now because there’s so much volatility in the economy and these people are making long-term bets where they buy land years ahead of actually trying to get a sale. And so if your whole supply chain and your labor market have been disrupted, it’s just harder and harder to make that bet. Frum: Okay. Here’s where I want to end. I want you to think about someone who’s 28, 30, 31, who’s confident that they’re going to keep their job for a little while so they don’t have the immediate fear, I’m going to lose my job, which many people have right now. But let’s say you don’t have that fear, but they don’t own a home. What’s the outlook for them? Can you say something hopeful to them about their path ahead? And any advice for them about where they should be looking? Kelman: My hope is that for the first time since 2012, home prices are coming down, and I think that trend is going to continue into 2026. And so maybe time is on your side. It also seems likely that rates are going to come down, at least somewhat. And so I don’t think there’s going to be some revolution that lets you buy a home for half the cost in three years. But I do think that after years and years of home prices going up, at least since 2012, homebuyers are going to get a break. And I’m really glad that you are. Frum: Thank you. Thanks for talking to us, Glenn. We’re so grateful to you for your candor and your time. Kelman: Yeah, David, it’s good to see you.

Title: Solana Price Rebound Ignites Buying; Traders Stock Up on Pepe and This L2 Gem with 200x Potential

The recent surge in Solana price has reignited enthusiasm across the meme coin sector, drawing fresh attention to both the established meme coin Pepe and the hot new $LBRETT. As investors seek the next high-yield meme coin, comparisons between Solana’s performance and the rapid ascent of newer tokens like $LBRETT have intensified, especially given the ongoing presale, remarkable staking rewards, and technological advantages on offer. SOL has overcome numerous network challenges to secure its place as a top-tier crypto asset. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem have cemented its reputation among leading blockchains. SOL Technical indicators such as EMA and MACD signal a bullish continuation, with analysts projecting further Solana price upside in the near term. These positive forecasts are fostering increased interest in meme coins built on newer, more scalable platforms. PEPE, the prominent meme coin, has ridden waves of viral popularity and speculative trading. Despite the absence of major recent price news, its established brand presence continues to attract traders. Technical models for PEPE suggest that it remains a force in the meme coin arena. Its upside potential to explode is still there and has prompted many savvy investors to stock up on it, expecting the meme coin season to start soon. Unlike its rivals, $LBRETT is widely considered to possess the capacity to surpass both SOL and PEPE in terms of price appreciation. Analysts point to the project’s rapid community growth, innovative staking model, and presale momentum as drivers for an anticipated 200x increase from current entry levels. With the presale price rising at each round, even the current $0.004 price tag is still deeply discounted. The upside potential is drawing significant attention from both seasoned and new investors. Industry experts are predicting 200x not on hot hair, but are basing this on facts. The live presale has already raised over $190,000, underscoring rising demand. Available for immediate staking, the $LBRETT APY is exceptionally high, even though it has dropped significantly from its original 25,000%. The falling reward has created a stir in the market, with traders rushing to join and take advantage of the APY before it is too late. Layer Brett leverages high-speed, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting from the security of Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem and enabling fast transactions with very low gas fees. Here are just a few things that combine meme power and actual utility: With Solana price action invigorating the meme coin markets, both Pepe and $LBRETT are capturing investor interest. However, $LBRETT’s combination of explosive meme attraction, exceptional staking rewards, Layer 2 Ethereum technology, and innovative features positions it as the meme coin most likely to achieve the coveted 200x potential.Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme!

Title: How deals with Apple and Trump’s Pentagon turned rare earth miner MP Materials into a red-hot stock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/12/rare-earths-magnets-mp-materials-stock-surge-landmark-deals-trump-apple/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. California miner MP Materials struck metaphorical gold in July when it announced a landmark deal with the Trump administration to make the Defense Department its largest shareholder, followed up days later by an expansion agreement with Apple. But what MP actually mines—so-called rare earth elements that are central to many of the world’s most important technologies—appears to be even more precious than gold to investors. MP is the nation’s only rare earths miner, at a time when the U.S. aspires to compete against China’s supply-chain dominance in the field. Its share price has spiked an astonishing 365% year to date, including a 150% surge in just over a month. MP’s market cap has risen from just over $2 billion to $13 billion, entering large-cap territory—not bad for a company that brought in just $204 million in revenue last year. It’s a rise comparable to that of Silicon Valley defense firm Palantir—but with all due respect to that AI-fueled company, Palantir’s stock has risen by only 140% year to date. “I give MP credit for having the foresight and for being in the right place at the right time,” Ben Kallo, Baird senior research analyst, told Fortune. “I think it’s surprising because I didn’t believe the government would react in such a quick and forceful way. “I think the fire is in the belly of supply-chain managers to move away from China right now.” MP also is the nation’s only vertically integrated miner and specialty magnets producer, having just opened a metals and neodymium magnets plant in Fort Worth. Not one to miss a marketing opportunity, MP named that plant “Independence.” The powerful magnets are as critically important as they are little-known. They are used in electric vehicles, renewable energy, mobile phones, military equipment, and, most recently, AI data centers. General Motors was MP’s first flagship customer for magnets. From a military standpoint, the magnets are just as crucial: They’re used in drones, fighter jets, missile systems, and nuclear submarines. More than 80% of the world’s neodymium magnet supply is manufactured in China. The U.S. counts a few manufacturers, while China has a few hundred. “Rare earth” materials actually are not rare, but they are expensive to separate and refine. That growth takes financial support. The Defense Department bought $400 million worth of MP shares in July to become a 15% shareholder; on Aug. 10, it backed up its initial deal with an additional $150 million loan to MP to help expand its mining operations in Mountain Pass, Calif. “We are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military to achieve President Trump’s goal of peace through strength,” said Emil Michael, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, in a statement. Michael is a former top executive at Uber. Even apart from the military, both MP and the administration see the company growing because of the AI boom. “We have the platform, the partners, and the perspective to seize another enormous runway of opportunity,” said MP founder, chairman, and CEO James Litinsky on the company’s Aug. 7 earnings call. “And it does not hurt that we have a front-row seat and an important role in what may well become the most significant business transformation of our generation, the era of physical AI.” MP is built on the ashes of the former mine owner Molycorp and its Mountain Pass facilities. A decade ago, Molycorp was failing because of heavy indebtedness and China’s price dumping into the global rare earths markets. Seeing the thesis case for domestic rare earths mining, Litinsky and his eponymously named JHL Capital Group hedge fund bought into Molycorp’s bonds during its 2015 bankruptcy proceedings. Litinsky eventually folded his fund to buy the Mountain Pass assets outright and form MP Materials in 2017. Litinsky had previously worked at the New York–based Fortress Investment Group, and MP Materials went public in 2020 when it merged with one of Fortress’s several special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in a $1.47 billion deal. “One of the biggest question marks and pushback was, ‘How can these finance guys operate a mine and make it work?’” Kallo said. But MP cleaned up its mining operations, kept debt low, and focused on vertical integration and growth. “They’ve surprised to the upside.” The Independence plant opened in January, and MP was looking at a smoother growth trajectory. But in the spring, the onslaught of Trump’s tariff war shook things up, and companies began to realize they shouldn’t rely on Chinese supply chains so heavily. “A lot of companies didn’t realize their magnets came from China,” Kallo said. “It woke a lot of people up. These magnets go into everything.” This is when the Wall Street–ization of the Defense Department under the second Trump administration came into play. Steve Feinberg, the new U.S. deputy secretary of defense, is the billionaire cofounder of Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg spearheaded the unusual, landmark deal with Litinsky. It not only made the Pentagon a 15% shareholder, it included the pledge of a multibillion-dollar total investment as MP aims to expand its magnet production capacity 10-fold. That expansion is expected to be completed in 2028. The deal also puts a floor on pricing for MP’s rare earth materials for 10 years, helping offset the possibility of foreign price dumping. A Defense Department spokesperson told Fortune: “Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won’t happen overnight, but DOD is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production.” Four days after the Pentagon deal announcement, on July 15, MP announced a $500 million partnership with Apple to supply rare earth magnets that are fully manufactured from recycled materials, a pledge that would entail recycling expansions at both the Mountain Pass and Fort Worth facilities. MP and Apple had piloted advanced recycling technologies for five years before announcing the deal. “American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.” MP used to ship more of its raw materials to China because of a lack of U.S. refining capacity. One potential stumbling block for MP was its smaller ownership stake still held by China’s Shenghe Resources, which had helped Litinsky buy out Molycorp in 2017. But the larger U.S. government ownership position combined with the new pricing floor and Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports has allowed MP to cease its exports to China as of April. “We are maniacally focused on investing and executing in the United States of America,” Litinsky said on his earnings call. He emphasized, “Through years of relentless execution, this team has transformed a bankrupted and abandoned mine site into a vertically integrated American national champion with a strategic and economic platform that matters.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Tesla’s Stock's Next Surge: 4 Catalysts To Watch
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/12/teslas-stocks-next-surge-4-catalysts-to-watch/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) has encountered a challenging year in 2025, marked by political conflicts, declining sales, and increasing competition. Nonetheless, it might not be entirely bleak for Tesla, as a series of new catalysts could be rejuvenating the stock’s long-term bullish outlook. With opportunities presented by AI and a favorable cost structure in a changing tariff environment, Tesla is regaining the attention of investors, and its shares have appreciated nearly 6% in the last five trading days. While valuations remain high at approximately 195x forward earnings, the narrative might be shifting in favor of Tesla. Here’s a brief overview of the positive factors fostering optimism in the stock. Elon Musk’s significant and very visible discord with President Donald Trump, following a brief political alliance during the 2024 campaign and initial months of the Trump presidency, created uncertainty regarding Tesla’s regulatory outlook. However, public sentiment seems to be changing. Recently, Trump has softened his rhetoric, stating, “I desire for Elon’s business to thrive,” and has generally been more lenient towards his friend-turned-adversary. While there are still policy risks, a more amicable relationship could alleviate a major burden. In addition, Elon Musk is back in charge at Tesla after a temporary stay in Washington, now fully concentrating on Tesla’s mission – enhancing EV production, launching robotaxis, and envisioning AI-powered robotics. Tesla has recently communicated to its shareholders a new compensation agreement for Musk, which includes 96 million restricted shares valued potentially at nearly $30 billion, contingent on ambitious performance targets. This indicates that Musk is directly motivated to provide substantial returns for shareholders. However, investing in a single stock carries considerable risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is intended to mitigate stock-specific risk while still offering upside potential. AI computing has been the most significant trend in the technology sector over the past three years, driving valuations to unmatched levels. Nvidia is now valued at nearly $4.5 trillion and Broadcom around $1.5 trillion, primarily due to the demand for AI computing infrastructure. Just as AI computing became the foundational component for the digital AI explosion, “physical AI” might emerge as the next significant opportunity. We believe that the markets could be beginning to perceive Tesla as a type of proxy for physical AI. The company uniquely integrates cutting-edge software, advanced hardware, and extensive manufacturing know-how – three essential elements for leading this budding sector. Tesla’s extensive experience in autonomous driving has provided it with a substantial advantage in AI software, its robotics proficiency is deeply ingrained in its highly automated factories, and its vertical integration ensures oversight from chip design to final assembly. Besides self-driving vehicles, Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot designed to carry out repetitive, hazardous, or mundane tasks in factories, warehouses, and homes, could represent a significant revenue stream for Tesla. The goal for Tesla is to mass-produce millions of units annually by 2030 at a price point below $20,000, thus opening a new market with immense potential. Unlike many small robotics startups, Tesla possesses the financial resources, engineering expertise, and manufacturing capacity to transition from prototype to mass production. Check the analysis on How Tesla stock soars to $1500 While Tesla’s deliveries declined by 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in Q2, investors seem to be overlooking this drop. Recent regulatory alterations under the Trump Administration, which are generally viewed as detrimental for the automotive industry, might actually benefit Tesla. A 25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks was implemented in April 2025, followed by tariffs on specific imported auto components in May. Tesla could emerge as a net winner, building all U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, thereby avoiding these tariffs, while competitors such as GM and Ford manufacture some EVs in Mexico and may incur higher costs. As these tariffs ripple through the supply chain, Tesla’s price competitiveness could enhance, aiding it in defending and expanding its U.S. market share. Furthermore, although the federal electric vehicle mandate has been eliminated, Tesla’s standing as one of the lowest-cost EV manufacturers remains solid, giving it an edge over other competitors who may have leaned more heavily to compensate for a higher cost structure. The company’s prudent management of fixed costs, including R&D and SG&A, has allowed it to maintain profitability even in tough market conditions. Also see: Will Slowing Cloud Business drag Amazon stock to $100? One of the most exciting prospects for Tesla could be its robotaxi service. Admittedly, Tesla will need to catch up to Google's Waymo, which has been providing autonomous rides in several cities for nearly five years. Nevertheless, Tesla has several advantages. The company manages the entire process: it manufactures the EVs, develops the software, and runs the charging infrastructure. Additionally, it has a large fleet of vehicles already on the road that can be integrated into its robotaxi service. In contrast, Waymo's vehicles are significantly more expensive, with modifications necessary for self-driving estimated to cost as much as $100,000. This gives Tesla a considerable advantage. Tesla has now secured a ride-share license in Texas, paving the way for its autonomous robotaxi service to function under the state’s new self-driving laws alongside established competitors like Uber and Lyft. The ride-hailing market is already substantial. Uber managed over 230 million rides weekly in Q4 2024 alone. At approximately $30 per ride, this equates to a $375 billion annual revenue pool, and that’s just for human-driven rides. Autonomous rides could potentially yield even more – possibly reaching $750 billion annually. This represents a significant revenue opportunity for Tesla. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What is the reason for this? As a collective, the HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a much more stable experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The best credit cards to add to your wallet

Search The Points Guy As soon as people find out that I work for The Points Guy, they almost always follow up with one question: "What's the best credit card?" My answer is usually, "It depends" — because there truly is no one-size-fits-all credit card that's best for everyone. Several factors go into determining the best credit card for your situation, including your spending habits, your credit score and the type of rewards you want to earn. Some regular contenders frequently make the cut when I recommend new credit cards since they offer solid value for a variety of spenders and their lifestyles. I've had my fair share of them over my 20-plus years of collecting points and miles. Here are my top picks for the best credit cards you can add to your wallet. *TPG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor. **The information for the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. Check out how my top recommendations for the best credit cards stack up against each other. †You must use the card five times each statement period to earn points on rent and qualifying net purchases. Standout benefits: The Chase Sapphire Preferred was one of the first cards I opened that carried an annual fee. Initially, I got the card because it didn't charge foreign transaction fees, but I quickly fell in love with the rewards I was earning — both abroad and back in the U.S. By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time. Chase Ultimate Rewards points are among the most valuable currencies out there, pegged at 2.05 cents each per TPG's August 2025 valuations. As a Sapphire Preferred cardholder, you can redeem your points through Chase Travel at a rate of 1.25 cents apiece, but my favorite way to use Chase points is by transferring them to travel partners like Air Canada Aeroplan and World of Hyatt. Hyatt is my go-to redemption option here, as I almost always get well over 2 cents per point in value from my award stays. For example, I splurged for four nights at the Hyatt Centric Park City earlier this year, and even though it set me back 180,000 points, the paid rate would've been nearly $6,000. I was even able to apply a suite upgrade as a Hyatt Globalist. Related: Why the Chase Sapphire Preferred should be your first card out of college Beyond that, the card offers an incredible set of travel protections if things go wrong on your trip, including primary car rental coverage. You'll also enjoy a $50 annual hotel credit for reservations made through Chase Travel. I eventually upgraded to the card's more premium sibling — the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees) — a few years ago, but my wife continues to hold her Sapphire Preferred and still gets incredible value from it. New applicants can earn 75,000 points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. The Sapphire Preferred features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Apply here: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Standout benefits: I picked up the Capital One Venture X shortly after it launched in November 2021, and it quickly became a workhorse in my wallet because it earns at least 2 miles per dollar spent on every purchase. I charge my utility bills and most of my online shopping to it, since those purchases generally aren't eligible for bonuses on other cards. The card also offers a ton of premium perks without a premium price tag. You'll enjoy access to Capital One Lounges and a Priority Pass Select membership, along with the ability to enjoy value-added benefits on luxury hotel stays via the Premier Collection and Lifestyle Collection. All of this comes with an annual fee of just $395. However, even that is super easy to offset with other perks on the card. You'll get an annual $300 credit for purchases via Capital One Travel — including flights, hotels and rental cars. You can also use the card for up to $120 in statement credits to cover the cost of a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years. Related: Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Capital One Venture X Finally, when you renew your card, you'll receive 10,000 bonus miles on your account anniversary. Those are worth at least $100 if used for travel, but they have the potential for even more value when you redeem them with Capital One's 15-plus transfer partners. I recently transferred 70,000 Capital One miles to Air Canada Aeroplan to book a one-way business-class flight to Europe for Thanksgiving — a trip that would've otherwise set me back over $3,000. And that's just one method of maximizing your Capital One miles. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $395 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture X. Learn more: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: Believe it or not, I first added the Amex Gold to my wallet without earning a welcome bonus. I held an earlier version of the card, so I wasn't eligible. However, I still earn tens of thousands of points on the card every year — and last year's refresh made me love it even more. I love dining out and cooking in, and the Amex Gold rewards you in both categories. You'll earn 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar) and 4 points per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar). Membership Rewards points are super valuable — with partners like ANA Mileage Club and Air France-KLM Flying Blue. Related: How to maximize the Amex Gold's benefits However, the card can also save you money on everyday purchases as well, thanks to the following benefits (enrollment required): ***Uber Cash is valid on purchases in the U.S. and you must first add your Amex Gold to your Uber account. You can then redeem with any Amex card. In fact, I was getting so much value out of this card that my wife was convinced to get her own Amex Gold card last year — essentially doubling the value we can get from these statement credits every year. With the Amex Gold, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as high as 100,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $6,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $325. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Gold Card. Apply here: American Express Gold Card Standout benefits: Before I got the Capital One Venture X, I had the regular Venture Card — which is a great alternative for those who aren't willing to pay for a premium rewards card. You'll enjoy the same base earning rate of 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases, and you'll enjoy access to Capital One's Lifestyle Collection of hotels around the world. The card also includes up to $120 in statement credits for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years — a rarity for a card with just a $95 annual fee. In addition, the Venture Card can be the perfect option for those just getting started who value simplicity but may want the option of maximizing rewards in the future. Capital One miles can be used to offset any travel purchase charged to the card at a value of 1 cent per point. However, you also have the ability to leverage Capital One's transfer partners for even more value. This gives you a great starting point — with the chance to unlock more rewards down the road. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture Rewards. Learn more: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: I've held the Amex Platinum for years, and it's among the priciest travel cards out there, with a massive $695 annual fee. However, each time my card comes up for renewal, I crunch the numbers and realize that I easily get that much in value every year — and then some. For example, when you add the Amex Platinum to your Uber account, you'll receive $15 a month in Uber Cash plus a one-time bonus of $20 in the month of December (valid for rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S.; can pay using any Amex card). I also enjoy the up to $20 a month in statement credits I receive for select digital entertainment providers, which I use to offset the cost of my daughter's Disney+ obsession (enrollment is required). Then there's the up to $200 airline fee statement credit each calendar year — which I mainly use for Sky Club guest access for my daughter. These three perks alone can offer me up to $640 in annual benefits, nearly covering the card's entire annual fee. Enrollment is required. Related: Maximizing the Amex Platinum's benefits Beyond these statement credits, the Amex Platinum offers unparalleled airport lounge access, including Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass lounges (enrollment is required) and Plaza Premium locations. You can also access Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta Air Lines, though you are capped at 10 visits per year unless you spent $75,000 in the current (or previous) calendar year. There's nothing I love more than relaxing in a quiet space prior to a flight — and the Platinum Card delivers just that. With the Amex Platinum, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as 175,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $8,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $695. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Platinum Card. Apply here: Amex Platinum Standout benefits: I've been a longtime Delta flyer. In fact, I was a charter Diamond Medallion member when that elite status first launched in 2010 — qualifying entirely on domestic segments, no less. And even though I'm no longer a road warrior, I still love flying Delta. And the Delta Reserve Card helps make those trips even more rewarding. Even though it carries a hefty annual fee, the perks are extensive. You'll receive 2,500 Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) each year just for having the card, putting you halfway to Silver Medallion status. You can then earn 1 MQD for every $10 spent on the card, allowing you to spend your way to status. The card also includes 15 visits to Sky Clubs every year plus four, one-time-use guest passes — though you can unlock unlimited visits as the primary cardmember when you spend $75,000 on purchases in a calendar year. But my favorite perk is the annual companion certificate you receive upon renewal. This allows you to bring a travel companion on select Delta-operated flights just by paying the taxes and fees. It's even valid on select Comfort+ and first-class tickets. Last year, I used this for a flight to Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) for me and my daughter to go skiing, a ticket that would've otherwise been over $900. New applicants can earn 70,000 miles after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. This card's annual fee is $650. For more information, check out our review of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve. Apply here: Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Standout benefits: You may be surprised to see a cash-back credit card on this list, but the Freedom Flex is so much more — let's start with the earning rates. Cardholders earn 5% cash back on the first $1,500 in combined purchases you spend each quarter in rotating bonus categories (after activation). With a wife and 10-year-old daughter, I spend a ton at Amazon, so that's a great return on purchases I'm already making. However, I'm not just earning cash back. Instead, since I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, I have the ability to combine these rewards in my Sapphire account — which effectively converts them to fully transferable Ultimate Rewards points. In other words, this card allows me to earn 5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on these rotating categories. Related: 4 reasons I recommend the Chase Freedom Flex to beginners In fact, I max out the quarterly bonus so frequently that I have both this card and the old Chase Freedom card (no longer available to new applicants) — which means I have double the earning potential each month. With this no-annual-fee card, new applicants can earn $200 after spending $500 on eligible purchases within the first three months of account opening. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Freedom Flex. Apply here: Chase Freedom Flex Standout benefits: The Ink Business Preferred can be a great fit for virtually any small business — but especially those with a big online presence. That's because of the bonus categories on the card. Each year, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on up to $150,000 in combined spending across the following categories: If you fully max out that bonus, you'll take home 450,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points — which can then be used for cash back, gift cards or trips through Chase's lucrative transfer partners. It also has no foreign transaction fees when you're outside the country, and with extensive travel and purchase protections for business trips, it can give you valuable peace of mind when on the road. New applicants can earn 90,000 points after spending $8,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Ink Business Preferred. Apply here: Ink Business Preferred Standout benefits: The Bilt Mastercard is the one card on this list that I've never had. However, that's solely due to the fact that I own my home. If you're a renter, and you're not currently earning points on your monthly rent, this card should absolutely be in your wallet. That's because you can earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent (up to 100,000 points each calendar year) without paying any transaction fees (see rates and fees), as long as you charge at least five purchases to the card each month. This holds true even if your landlord or apartment management company isn't part of the Bilt Rewards program and doesn't accept credit cards. You can log in to the Bilt Rewards app and use your Bilt Mastercard to send a monthly rent check or direct deposit, earning points in the process. Related: Guide to the Bilt Rewards program In addition to rent, you also earn 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft (after you link your Bilt and Lyft accounts), 3 points per dollar spent on dining, 2 points per dollar spent on travel and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. And Bilt Rewards Points are incredibly valuable, with a wildly lucrative list of transfer partners — including World of Hyatt and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan. Plus, Bilt runs Rent Day promotions that allow you to earn even more points on your everyday purchases — and potentially get even more value from your redemptions. The Bilt card does not come with a welcome offer and does not charge an annual fee (see rates and fees). For more information, check out our review of the Bilt Mastercard. Apply here: Bilt Mastercard Standout benefits: It's true that I have a lot of premium credit cards, but if you're looking to up your hotel game, the Hilton Aspire Card can be a great option. Beyond the hefty welcome bonus, it also unlocks a ton of perks — both when staying at Hilton properties and across other spending activities. For starters, you'll enjoy automatic top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status, just by holding the card. This grants you complimentary upgrades as well as a daily food-and-beverage credit at eligible properties in the U.S. (or complimentary breakfast at international locations). This status normally requires 60 nights to achieve, so this is a remarkable shortcut. Related: 7 reasons to get the Hilton Amex Aspire card In addition, you get a free night certificate when you open the card and then every year after renewal, and this can be used at virtually any Hilton property worldwide (with just a few exceptions). In addition, you'll enjoy up to $400 in annual statement credits at Hilton resort properties — up to $200 from January to June and up to $200 from July to December. Last year, I used the certificate to book the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach when the room rates were over $800 per night — and I used the $200 credit for the second half of the year to cover most of a spa treatment for my wife (it was her birthday). Talk about rewarding! Finally, I love the up to $200 in statement credits for airline purchases each year, broken up as $50 each quarter. I've used this for taxes and fees on award tickets as well as inflight food and beverage purchases. New applicants can earn 175,000 points after spending $6,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership. This card features an annual fee of $550. For more information, check out our review of the Hilton Aspire Card. There's no denying that there are a lot of credit card options from which to choose. However, there are a few important things to consider when trying to pick the one that's best for you. However, one of the great things about having so many cards at your disposal is that you're not locked into a long-term commitment. If you want to try a new card, you can earn the welcome bonus and utilize the perks for the first year. Then, if it's not worth keeping, you can cancel it. (Just don't do it before the first year is up.) First, it's critical to think about your preferred rewards currency. Do you want cash back or travel points? Are you interested in rewards in a specific airline or hotel loyalty program? Part of this may be geographical. After all, earning American miles if you're based in Atlanta may not be worthwhile, given Delta's hub. However, if you live in Charlotte or Philadelphia, American may be a much better option. Alternatively, consider earning transferable rewards on cards like the Sapphire Preferred, Amex Gold or Capital One Venture. These points or miles convert to a number of airline and hotel partners, allowing you to book premium flights or luxury hotels by leveraging program sweet spots. Most cards offer welcome bonuses to new applicants, and these are a great way to quickly boost your account balance. Cards sometimes offer limited-time, elevated offers, so if you time it right, you could take home a ton of points or miles that can go a long way toward your next trip. Before you commit to a new card, take stock of your everyday spending habits. Most cards offer extra rewards in select categories of purchases, so you should pick one that matches where you spend your money. Are you a prolific chef at home? Go for a card with a category bonus at grocery stores. Love dining out? Get one with a bonus at restaurants. Or, if your spending is all over the place, get a card that offers a solid earning rate on all purchases. Finally, consider whether the cost of the card is worth it. The most rewarding cards out there typically impose an annual fee, and while this confers many perks, not all of them may be useful to you. While the welcome bonus typically offers enough value in year one, it's a harder decision after that. Crunch the actual, real-world value you can get from the card to make sure you get at least enough to cover the annual fee. Related: The 7 best credit cards with annual fees under $100 We chose the best credit cards based on a range of factors, including earning rates, welcome offers, benefits and perks. To read more about how TPG evaluates and chooses cards to spotlight in our roundups, check out our methodology. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of the cards on this list earn transferable rewards (the only exceptions are the Delta SkyMiles Reserve and the Chase Freedom Flex, though the latter becomes transferable in my wallet when paired with the Sapphire Reserve). That's because this type of rewards offers immense flexibility to book incredibly valuable trips. For example, let's say you want to book a flight to London by leveraging your Amex Platinum. Your first option is through American Express Travel, which offers a value of 1 cent per point. Alternatively, you can transfer Amex points to Delta, though SkyMiles award rates tend to be sky high. However, there's another option: Transfer your Amex points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, which can offer incredibly low rates to Europe — including economy and business class. Whenever someone asks me to name the best credit card, I always say that it depends. There are so many cards that could work for the average traveler, so it's critical to take some time to analyze what you want out of a card and where you spend your money. And if you're still overwhelmed, you really can't go wrong with any of the cards on this list — especially if you want to dip your toes into maximizing your rewards for your next trip.

August 11, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Tim Ferriss on The Productivity Mindset, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yes, I know I say I have an extra special guest every week. This week I have an extra, extra special guest, Tim Ferriss bestselling author of numerous books, including the Four Hour Work Week host of the Tim Ferriss podcast. He’s got a bajillion downloads on that. He’s written five number one bestselling books, including Tools of the Titans. He also has a new card game out called Coyote, which is getting a lot of buzz. He co-created this with a another gaming company called Exploding Kittens. You probably know Tim from some of his books or, or conversations or Ted Talks or what have you. I found him to just be such a thoughtful guy. He is really the chief scientist of his own experiment, the the Tim Ferriss experiment, where he’s constantly trying to figure out how his body works, how his psychology works, how his emotional world works, and has tried a variety of different things and sort of fastidiously documented what does and doesn’t work for him. That’s what led to his productivity book, the Four Hour Work Week. It’s what led to his health and fitness book, the Four Hour Body, on and on. He just tries a whole bunch of things, figures out, does the ab tests, figures out what works and what doesn’t. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss: Thanks for having me. Nice to be here. Barry Ritholtz: Well, it, it’s nice to have a fellow podcaster in here. I don’t, I don’t have to explain how this rolls. I, what I wanna do is I’m, I’m excited about your book. I know you have a new game out that we want to talk about, but I have to start by delving into your background, which is really fascinating. Bachelor’s in East Asian studies from Princeton. What, what were the original career plans? Tim Ferriss: So that was after a major switch. So the original career plan was actually neuroscience. Oh, kidding. So I was kidding. A neuroscience major. And there were a few reasons I wanted to focus on that. I have Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and hereditary bipolar and so on in my family. Barry Ritholtz: So, wait, we, we could have a whole ‘nother discussion on Neurodivergency and, and I was kind of fascinated by a lot of what you have done seemed to be hacks to manage and operate around whatever deficits you’re working with. Some deficits come with separate surpluses, but how significant were all these deficits to forcing you to come up with a methodology of just navigating life? Tim Ferriss: Well, the depression piece was a huge challenge for most of my life, and thankfully that has changed with a couple of different approaches and different tools, and that’s one of the drivers for the initial neuroscience. And there was someone in the Department of Psychology, but within the focus of neuroscience named Barry Jacobs at the time. And I was interested in Barry Jacobs as a possible mentor because he was focused on the role of serotonin and sleep and mood reg regulations and the neurobiology of depression. He also, and this was early days, he had of an interest in psychoactive substances, including LSD. So my, my interest in psychedelic compounds goes back a very, very long time. That would’ve been 19 95, 96, but I couldn’t personally do. I realized, and it is important and it is necessary at this point in time, the animal testing on rats used cats for a lot of the circadian rhythm studies, but I couldn’t euthanize these rats after doing various tests. And it wasn’t actually torture of any type. I just couldn’t, I couldn’t be hands-on with that at the time. So I switched to East Asian studies, but with a focus on mostly language acquisition. So I was still in the realm of let’s just say cognitive neuroscience, but more on the linguistic side. Danny Kahneman, I actually volunteered to be a research subject in a bunch of his studies. Barry Ritholtz: No kidding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Just to see what that was like. But at, Barry Ritholtz: At the time, had he already won the Nobel and like, I think it was 01, 02, something like that? Tim Ferriss: No, not yet. Not yet. So this was super early days. Still very well known on campus, but I guess it would’ve been Green Hall. They were pretty boring, to be honest. The tasks hitting space bars or something to indicate when you see a flashing green right box in the upper left hand corner of one of these very old school monitors. But that was one of the ways that I earned whatever it was, $5 an hour to pay for some of my expenses in Princeton? Barry Ritholtz: I kind of remember he was at Princeton and then Vancouver and then California. So my maybe, yeah, he Tim Ferriss: Bounced around, but at that time Princeton. Barry Ritholtz: Really, really interesting. So I get the transition, I guess if you’re gonna pick some space related to neuroscience, Asian studies can occasionally overlap with that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and I had been an exchange student. My first real trip outside of the US was an exchange student at age 15 to Tokyo, Japan. Amazing. Where I went to a Japanese school for a year. Barry Ritholtz: Are you fluent at all? Tim Ferriss: I am, yes. I still speak read less. So write, because you really have to practice that to keep it up. I can still speak and read Japanese and then got a couple of others. Barry Ritholtz: , I have a friend Noah Smith, who is physics and economics, like a killer double major. And he spent summers in, in raves Kyoto. Says Tokyo, you have to go. And that must have been fascinating at 15. That has to be a little overwhelming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a, it’s a fascinating very, for someone who grew up on Long Island and Barry Ritholtz: That’s right, you’re an East Hampton kid, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And at that point, I only spoke English very alien. It has the benefit of being incredibly alien, but incredibly safe. And the additional benefit that people tend to speak if they speak at all terrible English, which means you have to learn Japanese. Huh. So in contrast with a lot of, if you go to Spain or if you go to Norway, good luck learning Norwegian because people are gonna default to English. That just doesn’t really happen in Japan. So, not to mention the fact that I got there before smartphones, so I couldn’t just escape to texting with my friends. I was stuck. Barry Ritholtz: Use Google Translate to actually talk to people!? Tim Ferriss: Didn’t exist. Yeah. You were stuck. And that was a huge, huge benefit. So that is another reason, actually another reason why I chose Princeton was because it had the, one of the strongest, if not the strongest East Asian studies programs for at that time I was most interested in Japanese and Chinese, which I would’ve taken even if I had majored in neuroscience. Barry Ritholtz: So you graduate in 2000. I’m kind of fascinated that very quickly you start writing the four hour work week, which was published in oh seven, like that is a shockingly short period of time. You’re in your twenties. Yeah. When you’re selling what essentially becomes one of the top selling books of oh seven, I mean, it was on every bestseller list. I don’t have to tell you this, but I want listeners to understand. So the first question is, what on earth motivated you five years outta college to say, I think I’m gonna write a book. 00:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I actually explicitly never wanted to write anything. This was a commitment I made to myself after graduation longer than an email ever. Again. That was the promise, because my senior thesis, I felt almost killed me. So I didn’t want to write anything. But one of my professors at Princeton who really changed the trajectory of my life, a professor named Ed Chao, Z-S-C-H-A-U, we’re still in touch. He was a former competitive figure skater took companies public, one of the first computer science professors at Stanford. He did everything taught at Harvard Business School, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Real polymath, Renaissance man. And he taught a class called High Tech Entrepreneurship, which was electrical engineering 4 91. But you didn’t need to be an engineer. I wasn’t. And that class is what convinced me to move west. Keep in mind the timing. This was just before the dotcom implosion to kinda chase my riches and engage in tech. 00:09:10 And in 2001, after that startup I joined, had imploded. I started my own company and I was bootstrapping it. I didn’t raise any outside financing. And so Ed asked me to come back and talk to students about bootstrapping. So I went back twice a year to do this short lecture to students. And in one of the feedback forms, after years of doing this, one of the students who was not being serious, put in his additional comments, I don’t understand why you’re teaching a class of undergrads and graduate students. Why don’t you just write a book and be done with it? And I had really bad insomnia for decades, including at that time. So I would get these half-baked ideas for chapter titles or content or whatever, and I couldn’t get to sleep. And I would just jot it down and the notes from the classes I was teaching, which changed over time to track my experiences and these insomnia, middle of the night notes, formed the backbone of something, sent it to a mentor of mine who was an author. And unbidden, without asking me, was like, I think this is a great idea here. Meet so-and-so meet So-and-so, introduced me to various editors and agents. Keeping in mind now looking back, 28 or 29 publishers, meaning imprints said no. And then Crown bought it for next to nothing. I 00:10:35 [Speaker Changed] I love all the examples. I’m a big William Goldman fan whose book and ventures in the screen trade Oh, amazing. Introduce the phrase, nobody knows anything into the popular culture. And he talks about all the studios passed on Star Wars. All the studios passed on Raiders. Was it paramount that passed on? ET ’cause hey, we have this other alien adventure called Starman. Nobody remembers today. And, and you could go to other, 00:11:05 [Speaker Changed] You can go anywhere, fields, Starbucks, everybody passed on Starbucks 00:11:09 [Speaker Changed] Squid Games. The author couldn’t get it sold for 10 years. Yeah. Ultimately had to sell his laptop. Yeah. ’cause he was so broke. I love the John Wick story. He you have like this Yeah. Top Action Hero could not get Hong Kong gun fu made in Hollywood. Ended up funding it himself along with, I’m trying to remember the other actress who kicked money in and it’s now a $2 billion franchise. Yeah. So love those. So bestselling book that all the imprints passed on. Not a surprise at all. Yeah. It is a throw everything against the wall business model and we don’t care. And we’ll see what sticks and they miss this. 00:11:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s a, it’s a hits driven business in some ways. Very similar to the Angel investing later. I mean Sure. This type of kind of power law distribution. And the, what’s been wildest about the Four Hour Work Week, which is, is really a book on increasing per hour output, which is why it found a, a toehold in tech. And then the first New York Times coverage had Mark Andreessen, the famed entrepreneur, and now venture capitalist talking about it. He wants to work 80 hours a week, but he wants to get each of those hours to produce 10 times as much. And that’s the basic underlying theme of the book. So what’s wild about it is almost all the tech tools that I recommend and additional resources have expired. But even in 2017 when all of that stuff was irrelevant, the principles, the frameworks and so on, it ended up being on the Amazon top 10 most highlighted books of all time list in two 00:12:46 [Speaker Changed] Meaning from the Kindle version is what’s 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] So highlighted. Yeah. In 2017. So that would’ve been eight years later when all of the tech tools were just dinosaurs at that point, which has been, it’s been cool to watch. So, 00:12:59 [Speaker Changed] So, so I have, I’m thumbing through the book over the weekend. I read it way back when, and I’m revisiting an old copy, which I should have brought in to have you sign. And my wife says, four hour work week. What’s she, she’s an art teacher, fashion, illustration, and design. She’s like, what’s that about? And I say, I know this is not gonna be a conversation that’s gonna go any place productive. So I just say the Pato principle. Mm. She’s like, what’s that? Well, 80% of the value we derive from most activities, clients, effort, whatever comes from 20% of whatever that data set is. And she’s like, oh, is that true? I’m like, yeah, kind of really seems to be true. Oh, okay. And I know immediately like, this is not her sort of book, but how grossly am I oversimplifying the four hour work week by just reducing it to open principle? 00:13:54 [Speaker Changed] I think if you had to pick one principle in the book, that’s a good one. 00:13:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s it. Right. 00:13:57 [Speaker Changed] To focus on. Now it assumes a few things that sometimes get missed. Right? So people can jump to strategy before they really interrogate their direction or reasons for doing something. So the definition phase of that book where you’re really getting very clear on which target you are aiming for, I think is a, might sound strange, but an often underemphasized precursor to then doing an 80 20 analysis. Because for 80 20 or Pareto principle analysis, you’re looking at which 20% of the inputs roughly right? It could be 10, it could be 1% are producing the outsized percentage of the returns. Now that could be looking at your customers if you run a business, right? It could be looking at your physical exercise, what’s producing the adaptations. That’s a little trickier to do, but you can figure it out. You could look at it with medications too. I mean, it’s like, there are a lot of ways to apply it. And Vilfredo, Pareto noticed this in everything from agriculture and like pea production to wealth distribution. It applies all over the place. And actually Richard Kosh, KOCH has written a a lot on this subject under the moniker of the 80 20 principle. But I’d say if you had to pick one principle, that’s the one. Sure. 00:15:22 [Speaker Changed] Since we’re sitting here in Bloomberg, I, I just have to point out, it’s very much true for your portfolio. The vast majority of your gains. And if you read some of the research by people like Bess Binder, Hendrick, Bess Binder in Arizona State, it’s not even 20% that’s generating returns. It’s one or 2%. Yeah. That creates the vast majority. So there’s Pareto principle, hyper pato principle, but it’s kind of fascinating that you use this as a way to hack your own productivity, effectiveness, comfort level, mental health. Like you’ve applied this across a wide range of items. Have you ever found a space where it doesn’t work? 00:16:05 [Speaker Changed] I haven’t, to be honest. It’s, 00:16:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s just consistent 00:16:08 [Speaker Changed] Everywhere. It seems to be practically a law of nature that a few things. The the critical few versus the trivial many, it’s, it’s almost always a few things. 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] The critical few versus the trivial many. Yeah. That, that is a fabulous summation of that. Yeah. I really, I really like that. So let’s, let’s stick with the book for a moment. Sure. In the book, you have a lot of practices and tools and routines. I know some of them are, are still valid today. Some of them may or may not have, for lack of a better word, expired. What were the most important items you learned? What are the ones that people speak to you and say, Hey, this resonated. This really had a big impact on me? 00:16:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the first is, well, let me zoom out and say that I, I went back and I looked at the book, which is always tough for me on some level. ’cause I, I, I published it when I was 29, right? I’m turning 48 soon. And so there’s, there’s a little bit of chest puffing and so on. ’cause I was completely unknown at the time, which makes me wince. But overall, the principles are still things that I apply all the time. But the tech tools, like using go to my pc, no, of course not. That’s changed. That world has changed. But the principles and the, the frameworks, the exercises still apply. So there I would say a few things get echoed to me a lot. One is the practice of fear, setting fear, 00:17:38 [Speaker Changed] Fear setting, define fear setting for the audience. Sure. 00:17:41 [Speaker Changed] It’s very simple. So fear setting is based on the, I think, accurate assumption that oftentimes we are taught to set goals or we have a framework for trying to set goals like smart, right. Specific, measurable, et cetera, with a timeline. But if you have the emergency break on with some set of amorphous fears about starting a business, quitting your job, getting engaged, getting divorced, taking a vacation from your job or your business, whatever it might be, that that is the kind of rate limiter. And what you can do, and people can find this for free, if you just go to watch my TED talk, which has, I don’t know, 12 million views now, 00:18:26 [Speaker Changed] 18 tight minutes of here’s what to do with your life. 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s, well, it just focuses on this exercise of fear setting, which I still do probably once a quarter. And the basic idea is you take whatever you’re considering that you haven’t yet done because you have some degree of fear or apprehension. You write down all of the worst things that could happen. Let’s just call it a list of 20 in excruciating detail. Make them specific. Then you have another column, which is what you could do to minimize the likelihood of each of those things happening. Last column, if e each of those happened, what could you do to recover or temporarily stop the bleeding, right? So, okay, you try business after quitting your job, which by the way, I don’t recommend. You can moonlight and do various things to hedge against risk, but then it doesn’t work. Okay. Can you temporarily Airbnb a bedroom in your house or your bed? 00:19:17 Can you get a job bar attending just to get back on your feet? Sure. Of course you can. So when you start to do that, and then there’s a separate page where you also write out the costs of inaction, which is a neglected step. When people are considering what they’re doing, they look at the risks of doing something, but they don’t look at the risks of not doing that thing. So if you telescope out a year, three years, what are the financial, emotional, familial or relationship costs of not doing the thing you’re considering? And when you then look at these things, which represent your thoughts trapped on paper, a lot of people are able to do the scary thing. So I would say that that one gets echoed a lot. And then this concept of mini retirements. So engineering a way such that you can take four weeks completely off the grid or disconnected, which is very, very, very achievable. That seems 00:20:13 [Speaker Changed] Four weeks in a row or a week, every quarter, 00:20:16 [Speaker Changed] Like three to four weeks in a row. Wow. 00:20:18 [Speaker Changed] That’s a lot. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And what that forces you to do also is upgrade your sort of systems and policies and automation in your life or in your business, or even in your job by teaching subordinates how to do things autonomously. And the value of all those things outlives the mini retirement. So I’d say those are two that come back a lot. 00:20:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting that you are approaching, laying out the pros and cons and things that lead to fear in a new venture. I, I contextualize that a little differently. You and I have both interviewed Ray Dalio. Yeah. And Ray’s great innovation and and contribution to finance. Finance has this very much fake it till you make it attitude. Never admit error. No, no, it’ll be great. Don’t worry if it didn’t work out this year, it’ll work out next year. And Ray very much said, no, that’s wrong. We’re all gonna make mistakes. It’s really important to learn from those mistakes. And I wanna say he’s the first guy that really put that out at all. 00:21:25 [Speaker Changed] But I, not to not to mention the transparency of having almost all meetings recorded, accessible by anyone within his firm. I mean, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of horrifying. They 00:21:36 [Speaker Changed] Did some pretty wild stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s a fascinating character. A 00:21:40 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But it leads to the question, what you’re talking about is really a way to prep yourself for a fear of failure. Is, is that fair to describe it? And 00:21:54 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Yeah. Or you know what? It’s a fear of failure, but oftentimes it’s this, it’s the fact you achieve, well, very, it’s gonna be very, very hard to achieve your goals. If they’re not very specific and clear. Even if you fail partially, that’s fine. You can still do great things. I think the, the parallel is that if your fears are unclear, nebulous, it’s just a feeling in your gut, but you don’t trap the specifics on paper, they’re very difficult to overcome. They will still be a break in your life. It is just as important to address that as it is to address the goals, to identify those sort of sticking points. And I would also say that I think of risk for people is often ill-defined, and there are many ways in different contexts to define risk. But if we look at it as the likelihood of a irreversible negative outcome, very few things have a 10 out of 10 value in that category. 00:22:57 Right? And then if you look at, for instance, if you look at the, and I encourage people to do this in fear setting, it’s like, from zero to 10, transient, recoverable, or permanent. What is the potential upside of doing this scary thing that you’re considering doing? And then if you stay doing what you’re doing, like what are the zero to 10 permanent transient risks or potential outcomes of not doing the thing when, when you then see, oh, if I do this thing, there could be all of these potentially semi-permanent or permanent benefits. If I try it and fail, the downsides are transient and like three outta 10, it makes the decision much, much easier. And the decision is the hardest part. Once you commit, then it’s just execution risk and implementation. And it’s the decision that is the hardest part for most people. 00:23:47 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s amazing that everything you’re saying is so applicable to public markets investing. Yeah. Because when people are in that panic mode, when they’re fearful, oh my God, we’re down 15%, the world is gonna come to an end. It’s always, no, this is transitory, this is temporary. Yep. How can you avoid making those permanent losses? How can you avoid those decisions that lead to really bad outcomes? And it’s really understanding, hey, is this a 10 or is this more likely a 2, 3, 4 on that 00:24:18 [Speaker Changed] Scale? Yeah. And I can actually, I’ll give something else in the, in the investing world, if we’re looking at, when people neglect the other side of a coin, and this is not gonna apply to like these super ultra pros, but a lot of people who participate in the public markets, they think about what to buy, right? What’s a good buy at this moment? They don’t think about hold period. They don’t think about selling strategy. What will be the cues? What are the underlying sort of thesis if invalidated, that would mean they should sell blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They don’t have a structured way of thinking about selling. And similarly, it’s like, if you just think about your goal, but you don’t have a structured way of thinking about fear and apprehension and so on, you’re equally handicapped. So that would be an, an easy kind of copy paste comparison, I would say. Huh. 00:25:08 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. You come out of college with Asian language studies and then you write a book on productivity and personal efficiency. How did you then pivot to angel investing and or advising? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] So the pivot, I guess, was an overlap in a sense because the four hour work week, I was based in Silicon Valley for 17 years. And I seeded the four hour work week at Tech Heavy Events. In part because it talks about an information, low information diet, and selective ignorance, and basically overcoming digital overwhelm. That’s a component of the book. And that pain was most acutely felt by people in tech at the time. So my early adopters, plus the people I had access to were techies in the very early stages of figuring out how I would launch this book. And what that had as a side effect, was developing relationships with various founders. And there were a lot of fans among CEOs and co-founders of startups. 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] Let me interrupt you, just to remind people. The book comes out in oh seven. Yep. This is before half of the companies that we think of as part of our daily lives. Oh. Well before were, you know, there was no public Alibaba, as I think that’s before Facebook, certainly long before Uber goes, goes public and Shopify, a lot of these companies were, you know, barely a gleam in the creator’s 00:26:42 [Speaker Changed] Eyes. Yeah. They didn’t, a lot of them either didn’t exist or they were very, very early stages. So I launched the book, my main launch strategy was South by Southwest, this festival in Austin, Texas in 2007, which was also the same south by Southwest, where Twitter basically went fully live in public, in full promotional mode. And the other piece of the story of angel investing is that I mentioned in the previous segment, my professor in school, ed Chao, his son-in-law at the time, Mike Maples Jr. Was a very well-known angel investor in Silicon Valley, had been an executive of various companies. And we became friendly. He wanted to lose some weight. I wanted to learn more about what he did. So we would have breakfast at this place called Hobies, and I would help him with his strategy for training and so on. At this point, also, the four hour work week could come outta nowhere and hit the New York loan up. Right. Hit the New York Times list, then went to number one and stayed on the New York Times list for four and a half years, or five years or something. That’s insane. And so he like 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Are, are you aware just of how lightning in a bottle that 00:27:51 [Speaker Changed] Is? Yeah. It’s bananas. It’s bananas. That’s part of the reason I haven’t wanted to go back and revise any of the writing. I’m like, I don’t wanna touch the butterfly and risk screwing it up. So he wanted to know how that happened. Like what did I do? And there were things I did for marketing and PR and so on to help catalyze that. And in exchange I’d say, tell me about your deals. What are you doing? I was always interested in investing. Eventually after a few months, all of these factors combined. I asked Mike and he was very generous with his time. If he might be open to me co-investing with him on some deals, very small checks, like I would put in 10 K so I wouldn’t eat up much of the cap table. I would put in a lot of work to try to help these companies. 00:28:33 And that is how the whole adventure started. I wanted to be the least expensive, most valuable person in terms of ratio on the cap table. So that those early founders would become my testimonials, basically for future deals. Very savvy. That’s how the whole thing started. And I decided to treat it like I would treat going to business school. I looked at Stanford at the time, ’cause I’d fantasized about going to Stanford Business School. I was like, okay, that’s 120 k over two years, I would’ve had to pay that outta pocket. So let me create the quote unquote Tim Ferris fund for Angel investing. It’s 120 K over two years, and I’m assuming that it’s sunk cost tuition, it’s gonna go to zero. None of the startups are gonna succeed. But if I can develop skills, learn a lot, and relationships that make it worthwhile, I’ll consider it a success. And that was the approach I took to doing it. And the timing was also great because I started in 2007, 2008, 2008 for a few years afterwards, was effectively considered a dotcom depression. Right. But that’s when I met Toby, the Shopify. Shopify, when they had nine employees or 12 employees Wow. And became an advisor. That’s when I started becoming involved with lots of companies of these very early stages, which ended up just to become these behemoths. 00:29:59 [Speaker Changed] I love your concept of this is a sun cost that’s going to zero. I think that’s the absolute right approach with startups. And you hinted at something that I, I have to explore a little bit. Anytime I throw money at a a small startup, it’s essentially a, this is gonna go to zero, but b, I really just want to invest in the jockey. I wanna put money into this person who, hey, this is easier than bearing a body. Yeah. Like, those are the two things I would do for this guy. Yeah. And a check. All right, I’ll, I’ll put a check into that. Yeah. And maybe it works out. I, I sense you have a similar belief in, you’re betting on, not on the horse, but the jockey 120 K is only 12 $10,000 checks. Yep. It’s not a lot. And I have to imagine there were a lot more opportunities. What criteria do you use to figure out who gets that check? Well 00:30:51 [Speaker Changed] Also, just as a side note, the reason I started trying to figure out advising and doing those agreements is that I ran outta money. I got over enthusiastic and I broke my own rules. And I think the first check I wrote was for like 40 K and immediately imploded. And I was like, uhoh, this is gonna be a problem. But leaving that aside, all of my best hits have been products that I would use personally that I could ideally be a power user of. And there have been a few exceptions, but by and large, they’re addressing problems that I feel acutely or needs that I feel or wants that I feel very acutely. So for instance, clear, how did Clear happen back in the day? It was called Clear Card and it was, it was not widely distributed. It was very little known. And I wrote a blog post back when blogs were a big deal. 00:31:45 And my blog at the time became very popular. And I wrote a huge piece on, on how to expedite travel. And a PA portion of that was about Clear card. I linked to their website and unbeknownst to me, I was one of the largest drivers of traffic to their website. And then at some point the leadership reached out to me and they said, Hey, do you wanna do something? And that’s how, that’s awesome. That relationship started. And I think I was the first advisor to clear, I mean, it was forever ago, so it must’ve been pretty 00:32:12 [Speaker Changed] Close. I wish they were in more airports just blown through JFK LaGuardia. It’s a blast with them. 00:32:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. They’ve done, they, they, from an execution perspective, they’ve been excellent. Also not based in Silicon Valley. And I, I don’t think that Silicon Valley’s the only place to go hunting for great companies. I mean, look at Shopify, Ottawa, Canada. Sure. Come on. That was Spotify, another one that was, that was neglected. So I also, so there were a few things. It was like, is it a problem or a need or a want that I feel and understand, is it something I can be a power user of? Therefore it makes it quite easy for me to promote to my audience. Could they be users or customers? And then lastly, for a while until this wasn’t viable, I looked for geographies that were neglected. So I actually, I went hunting in Canada a lot and works 00:32:57 [Speaker Changed] For comedy. Yeah, 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Or for Canadians. I mean, you look at some of the early experiences, like stumble upon, I was, I became an advisor to stumble upon and who was the founder of Stumble Upon, a guy named Garrett Camp. Stumble upon, I put tons of time into, he and I became close. We worked really well together. We enjoyed working together. Stumbled upon, ended up being a zero for me. But why is that? Okay. Because I, I talked about the relationships and the skills. Right? Okay. Relationship with Garrett Camp, what does he end up doing next? Co-founder of Uber, 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Not Too Shabby. Right. 00:33:32 [Speaker Changed] And then I was one of three people who had helped him with, stumble upon who became advisors to Uber Cab LLC at the time, which was I think 2008. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] Oh 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] My God. By the way, everybody said no to Uber. Everybody. 00:33:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That’s amazing to me because one of the things I find fascinating about VCs is they kind of put their failures on their websites as a badge of honor. Yeah. But it’s mostly, here are the companies we invested in that went belly up. They very rarely say, oh by the way, we passed on Uber, we passed on this, we passed on that. Yeah. You see less of that. 00:34:09 [Speaker Changed] You see less of it. And for me, I would say there’s lots of luck. But I was also trying to approach it in a systematic way. If you’re focused on effectively the way I would think about, let’s say I cut a $25,000 check. I’m like, okay, would I pay $25,000 just to develop these relationships and basically earn a graduate degree in whatever this startup is doing? If so, then great go. If not, then think twice. And taking that approach, all of the skills and the new knowledge and the relationships snowball over time. So I love highlighting failures that I would put in quotation marks because they’re actually just seeds and fertilizer for something that was intimately connected with the people and the skills that came right afterwards. This happens over and over and over again. So 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] I’m, I’m hearing relationship, I’m hearing tuition for skills and then even quote unquote failures. You don’t know what act two is gonna be where it could go. 00:35:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And then lastly, I would say one thing I did quite differently, and maybe more people do this now, but I I had never heard of it, is I treated a portion of my total budget for that real world MBA slash you know, Tim Ferriss fund in quotation marks a portion of that for marketing budget. What does that mean? I invested in, I bought secondary, so I bought equity from employees at Facebook and Twitter. Now it ended up being very early, but to my mind at the time, they were overpriced. Super expensive. Huh. But being in those deals was coveted. So having a little bit of equity in those two companies allowed me to say, I’m in these companies. Which then helped bolster the reputation and assisted in getting new deals. So I expected those to go to zero. That’s marketing budget. Right. They ended up working out kinda very unexpectedly working out really well. But I expected those to go to zero and it was pure marketing budget. 00:36:17 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard you mention a book by Sebastian Alibi, the Power Law. 00:36:22 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Great book. 00:36:23 [Speaker Changed] Tell us a little bit about what you learned from that book about investing in startups. 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] That is a, a great book if you wanna learn about venture capital and angel investing. Most of the approaches I had already learned just by being in the trenches for whatever it was, a decade before that book came out, I was introduced to Sebastian through more Money than God. Yes. Which is his book about Yes. Hedge funds. That is an exceptional book. And if you want some colorful characters, oh my God, give that a read. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] Plus he’s British and his take on everything is just, 00:37:00 [Speaker Changed] It’s fantastic. 00:37:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s so dry and so delightfully humorous in an unintentional way. 00:37:05 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. He’s, he’s a wonderful writer and very skilled at explaining. So what I would say about that book and what people might miss about startups is yes, it’s a hits driven business. There’s a power law distribution, meaning it’s pato principle on steroids. You’re probably gonna have one or two or three startups that give you the vast majority of your lifetime earnings, at least as an angel investor who’s not taking management fees. Right? Right. If you’re an asset accumulator and you have many, many, many overlapping billion dollar plus funds, like sure you’re gonna do great on management fees. 00:37:44 [Speaker Changed] VCs seem to do okay for themselves. It’s 00:37:47 [Speaker Changed] A pretty good business. Yeah. You have to be smart how, in how you approach it. But as an angel investor, I would say you need to have, if you’re gonna be effective in the long term, some coherent strategy or philosophy around portfolio construction so that you don’t run outta money. Right. It’s like staking someone in poker. It’s like you have to be able to sustain a string of bad luck. Right. And I would say that what Sebastian does so well is really detail how various MVPs in the world of venture capital have done that over time. And there, there are a few things I would point out also with respect to Silicon Valley that a lot of people miss. ’cause why did it happen in Silicon Valley? It’s like, sure, you can talk about like Fairchild Semiconductor, right. And I think it was the traitorous aid or whoever it was and all of this. 00:38:38 But why did that happen? Like why, why, why? I am always like ask why three times and you get to something interesting. Part of it is that non-competes are incredibly hard, if not close to, impossible to enforce in California. Yeah. What does that mean? It means that knowledge travels very freely. Talent travels very freely. So there’s a lot of competition and a lot of knowledge sharing sometimes to the chagrin of former employers. But that is part of the reason why Silicon Valley is still to this day it right now it would be the era of ai. If you wanna be in ai, if you really want to increase the likelihood of succeeding and you can raise enough money to pay for top talent, Silicon Valley’s still the place to be. Yeah. It’s not true for everything, but like it still matters. 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] No, no, no doubt about it. So let’s stay with the concept of return on investments. I’m curious as to one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve made, but not in terms of monetary returns. In terms of, and I’m, I’m delving into your space in terms of time, energy, productivity, efficiency. What do you find to be the most productive, useful investments that you’ve made? 00:39:52 [Speaker Changed] There are quite a, quite a few. I would say anything related to mental health ranks very highly. And we, we could talk about some of the things that have benefited me. So I come from a family of people who have died from various types of addiction, bipolar depression, major depressive disorder. I struggled with probably, I would say three to four major depressive episodes a year for most of my life. That much. Wow. That’s a lot. And that’s that. And each episode ranging on the length of a few weeks to a few months. I mean, that is a lot of time in darkness. And now I’m at a point where it’s maybe one depressive episode of a few weeks every two to three years. Those are two completely different human experiences. How, how 00:40:40 [Speaker Changed] Did you manage to actually manage this? Because there are people who suffer from depression and that’s the word, suffer and never find a way to get on top of it. 00:40:51 [Speaker Changed] I’ll mention just a few things in the order I might suggest investigating them. One would be, let’s call it metabolic psychiatry. So looking at the work of Christopher Palmer, most recently out of Harvard, I’ve interviewed him on using diet to help mental health. And fundamentally it tends to end up being some version of a ketogenic diet. You can get a lot of those benefits by doing intermittent fasting. So let’s just say what I’m doing today and what I do a lot of the time, which is only eating between like 2:00 PM and 10:00 PM that’s an eight hour window. So you fast for 16 hours every day and your body adapts to that incredibly quickly. I would say within a week you’re pretty grumpy for a a week and then you’re fine. Then the next, so that was the metabolic psychiatry piece. The second would be different types of brain stimulation. Specifically something called accelerated TMS, which we could talk more about. People can investigate accelerated TMS and scientists named Nolan Williams out of Stanford. But this can change people over the course of five days. It’s remarkable. 00:42:01 [Speaker Changed] TMS standing for 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So it’s a type of brain stimulation and it, it takes something that looks like a large hockey puck and put it on your head. It’s non-invasive and it feels like someone’s kind of tapping your skull. And depending on if you’re trying to address anxiety or depression or OCD, the target can be different. And if people investigate accelerated TMS in some studies with major depressive disorder, complete remission in 70 to 80% of participants. Wow. And you might need a booster once a year. But compared to taking maintenance drugs every day with non-trivial side effects, accelerated TMS is fascinating. I encourage to be, to check it out there, there are a couple of different devices, but look for accelerated TMS and listen to someone like Nolan Williams. There’s a lot of nonsense floating around. The last one I would say is psychedelic assisted therapies. And I say that last because it’s 00:42:59 [Speaker Changed] Like microdosing of psilocybin or what have you, 00:43:01 [Speaker Changed] Microdosing or macro dosing, meaning most of the scientific literature. And I’ve funded a lot of this science since 2015 with my foundation. I put like double digits of my net worth into this philanthropically, which tells you how much I believe in it. The intermittent use could be once, it could be a few times. Various compounds could be say psilocybin in the case of major depressive disorder or different types of addiction like alcohol use disorder. N NYU is doing a lot of great work on that front. Or MDMA assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. I mean the results are 00:43:38 [Speaker Changed] Very strong. 00:43:39 [Speaker Changed] Mind blowing. Yeah. I mean you, you have complex PTSD people who’ve had, let’s just say an average length of diagnosis of 16, 17 years, which means many, many interventions have failed who do two or three sessions with therapists for MDMAs psychotherapy and they have effectively complete remission of symptoms. That’s 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] And it is, I believe there’s a psychotherapist named Stanis Leff gr quite legendary in the space who says, you know what the telescope was or is for astronomy, what the microscope is for biology psychedelics will be for the mind. Really. And I believe that these compounds in the study of these compounds, which has become very, very, very popular and de-stigmatized thankfully, will completely revolutionize how we think of neurobiology and psychiatry in, in treating some of these so-called incurable or intractable conditions, including things like anorexia. And many of the things I already mentioned, those would be three that I’d say have had a huge impact on me. And it’s, it’s seems boring. We could talk about it if you want, but exercise, I mean 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] I was waiting for you to bring that up. ’cause every study in the world says that’s the miracle cure for so much psychological challenges. And it’s not like you haven’t written about 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] Exercise. Yeah. At all. Did a whole book on it. So yeah, the, the exercise, I’ll just mention two other things briefly. Cold exposure, and by the way, people have been using this for hundreds of years, but 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Certainly in the Swedish Nord countries. Oh yeah. It’s been, 00:45:17 [Speaker Changed] You know, forever. Yeah. Cold baths used to be prescribed for melancholy, AKA depression. And there is actually something to it. It could end up being after a few minutes when you shift from solely sympathetic nervous system activation fight or flight to parasympathetic could be actually stimulation of the vagus nerve. Who knows? It’s unclear at this point. But cold exposure matters like that, that is actually very reliable for mood elevation and seems to have some durability, which is wild exercise. People think of exercise and what you read about in the media a lot is like endorphins, endorphins, endorphins. Right. But that is not the full picture. If you wanna stave off Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, et cetera, or let me just broadly say neurodegenerative disease exercise provokes the release for something called Clotho, K-L-O-T-H-O, which people can investigate. And it is critical in staving off or or mitigating the onset and progression of, of these diseases. 00:46:15 So you have cloth endorphins. Sure. You have endorphins, you have endocannabinoids, cannabinoids. Sounds familiar. Like can like cannabis. Right, right. So those ha those can explain a lot both in terms of anti-inflammatory effects of some types of exercise. The, the benefits are just insane. So I would say follow Peter Attias advice. He’s credible, you know, trained at Stanford, Johns Hopkins in terms of zone two training. People can just look him up Zone two training a few times a week and then VO two max training, say once a week and some weight training. But the, if you didn’t do it for the physical benefits at all and just the cognitive benefits, including the release of things like brain drive, neurotrophic factor, that is also just a non-negotiable. 00:47:02 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned both Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and Yeah, 00:47:07 [Speaker Changed] I have both in my family. Yeah. 00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] So that’s where I was gonna, the exact question I was gonna ask you were never diagnosed, you just have a genetic predisposition and you’re trying to proactively just get way out 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] Ahead of this. I’m trying to get ahead of it. Yeah. And unfortunately, you know, a lot of the Alzheimer’s treatments as just to use that, that that disease as, as an example, a lot of the, the interventions fail. I think some scientists would, would agree with this. Not necessarily because the interventions themselves can’t work, but because the interventions are too late. By the time people have really elevated levels of amyloid plaques and tau protein and so on, by the time they have moderate to severe symptoms, it might just be too late. But there is an argument to be made. I mean, it’s very rare that late intervention is better than early intervention. So 00:47:57 [Speaker Changed] I just saw a piece in National Geographic yesterday that was kind of fascinating. It may be possible to detect Alzheimer’s risk sooner as earlier as your twenties. Yeah. So there is some sort of research going on in the space that’s productive. You’re talking about something much more aggressive and individualized to, to take care of your preventative maintenance in advance of being diagnosed with this into your own hands. 00:48:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. And by the way, all the stuff I just mentioned that has helped me from a mental health perspective and physical perspective with insulin sensitivity and so on. Like I just did, you know, I’m about to turn 48, just did my, I do blood testing at least once a quarter and my most recent labs are my best. Yeah, I 00:48:43 [Speaker Changed] See. You just had some I just went to function health. Yeah. Are you familiar with function health? I dunno. Function health. So Silicon Valley startup, they have come up with a way, it’s not a healthcare company, it’s a technology company. And they say we want to take a hundred data point screens of your blood and look at all these different markers to create a baseline. We do this twice a year. Your doctor looks at 15, 20 things normally. Yeah. They’ll go a hundred. And by the way, depending on your genetic predisposition, check all these additional boxes for things like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, et cetera. And so now you could check 150 data points and twice a year, especially if you are younger, alright, here’s a benchmark. And you’re creating this ongoing, for lack of a better word, horizontal set of data. And when something sort of spikes or is out of the normal range, you have a baseline that you could go back and, and work. I I literally did this Tuesday. Yeah, I yeah, I can see that. And I was like, oh, that’s a lot of blood, isn’t it? Like you, you, can you leave me a little, I got stuff to do later. But yeah, that in order to do a hundred different data series, they need a lot of different blood. 00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They need some blood. And I, I would say I don’t spend much money on stuff, but I do, I deliberately, some might say overspend on, on health, but what I was gonna say is the, the metabolic psychiatry, the less so accelerated TMS, but all, actually I, I should pull that back. TMS also can be applied to something like Alzheimer’s and psychedelic assisted therapies, the exercise, all of these and the cloth I mentioned specifically within exercise, all of those should in theory, help prevent or mitigate or delay the onset of, of some of these neurodegenerative diseases. So I am trying to get ahead of it. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be hyper-personalized. Like these things have clinical data or published literature behind them. There’s still a lot of unknowns, but you can do these things now. 00:50:49 [Speaker Changed] So it’s so funny you say hyper-personalized. I, I’m speaking to a buddy who’s a, a psychologist. Hey, who do you have coming up on the show? Oh, this week I’m seeing Tim Ferris and he says, oh, I love Tim. He is, I love this line. He is the chief scientist of Tim Ferriss, the person. And I’m like, that is such a great way to describe it. Yeah, that’s true. You’ve basically created an entire business model around being the chief scientist of your physical health, your mental health, even your genetic health. W was this ever part of the original game plan or did just this just evolve over time? 00:51:33 [Speaker Changed] I’ve almost always been that way in part because I was born premature. I had a ton of health issues, still have issues with thermal regulation, chronic sinusitis, all these things that, 00:51:46 [Speaker Changed] Wait, thermal regulation being thermal regulation, always hot or 00:51:49 [Speaker Changed] Cold, can’t handle hot well, the way that my body handles hot and cold is strange. So I can overheat very easily. As an example, the reason that’s relevant is the one sport that my mom put me in that thanks to her that I could be somewhat successful at. When I was a little runt, I was very small swimming up until about sixth grade wasn’t swimming, it was wrestling because the puny kid gets to go against the other puny kid. But I would overheat really quickly, which meant I needed to try to win quickly before I would hit my red zone. And that just catalyzed all sorts of bizarre, huh? Self experimentation. 00:52:27 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. 00:52:28 [Speaker Changed] Learning how to weight cut to use like potassium sparing diuretic. The, the reason that I wanted to make Tim Ferriss lab, this n of one set of experiments was to win at wrestling. That’s how it started. Huh. And then I realized, wait a second, you might be able to apply this stuff to the brain. And then in college I started experimenting with all sorts of stuff. Nothing illegal, but lots of weird stuff that was, I was using kind of off-label like hydrogen, various nootropics and so on. And they did have an effect, like they did have an effect on memory and cognition. Things like desmopressin for short term memory, for memorizing Chinese characters. Like that stuff worked right there. There’s no biological free lunch with that stuff. So 00:53:12 [Speaker Changed] What are the, why no free lunch? What’s the side effect? Well, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] You do pay, you do pay a price. I would just say a, a couple of quick tips for health tracking and so on, and I’m not a doctor, I don’t play one on the internet. But number one, since you mentioned it earlier, is I get blood tests done once a quarter at, at the very least. Now why is that? Well, I want more frame as high a frame rate as possible to look at trends. But separately, I wanna catch things early if I need to catch things. But I would say that if you do infrequent blood tests, the risk is that you get one set of lab results back and you make a ton of big decisions based on those labs. Here’s what I’ll say. There are lab errors all the time. And if you’re gonna do consistent blood tests, consistent is, is, is the key. In other words, do it on the same day of the week at the same time. Oh 00:54:05 [Speaker Changed] Really? Yes. I would not have guessed that. 00:54:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting because your testosterone has diurnal, it has. 00:54:11 [Speaker Changed] So the quest diagnostics as an example. Yeah. Don’t eat, don’t take supplements, don’t take any meds, whatever’s on your, your prescription lists. Stop the night before unless your doctor says don’t stop. Yeah. Follow 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Your doctor. But I’m saying if you measure your, 00:54:24 [Speaker Changed] But like you’re saying Monday at 10 is more important than, how significant 00:54:29 [Speaker Changed] Is that? Just be consistent because wow, if you, let’s just say you drink on the weekends and then you do your lab test on Monday morning versus doing it on Wednesday morning, some of your results might be different 00:54:39 [Speaker Changed] Of course. I mean that’s 00:54:40 [Speaker Changed] Obvious, but No, that’s, it’s not obvious to people because then really then they might have, after a weekend with birthday party with a friend and drinking, they have elevated liver enzymes like a LT or a sd, right? All of a sudden doctor only sees it once a year. He has no idea of the context. That’s fair. Testosterone, all these things can vary tremendously. And there are lab errors. So I would say before 00:55:02 [Speaker Changed] You, plus you also just get the regular noise and range and Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you’re low normal, sometimes you’re high normal, but it’s all, nothing is flatlined over time. Yeah. 00:55:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s gonna be normal variation. So I, I would just say that I’ll, I’ll keep it to one piece for now. Like really, if you’re about to get on a bunch of meds, unless it’s an emergency, look, there are emergencies that you need to deal with. But if it’s like, okay, you have this problem, we’re gonna put you on this med for the next year, before you do that, do the test again. Just get another blood test. Two days, two days later. 00:55:35 [Speaker Changed] Second opinion, 00:55:36 [Speaker Changed] Just confirm it. Huh. And again, not a doctor, not medical advice, informational purpose is only blah, blah, blah. But there 00:55:42 [Speaker Changed] You go. Dumb question. All the stuff you’ve done, game creation is not on your cv. Why did you decide to create a 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Game? Yeah, it seems like a total non sequitur. So a few reasons. Number one, I grew up feeling like I was saved by games specifically Dungeons and Dragons. 00:56:04 [Speaker Changed] Well, I know a ton. I have a ton of friends, many of whom were neurodivergent and d and d was a lifeline. Lifeline, 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely lifeline. So I, I may be pretty squarely in the neurodivergent camp. I’m not sure. 00:56:17 [Speaker Changed] Do you still play? 00:56:18 [Speaker Changed] I don’t, but here’s why 00:56:20 [Speaker Changed] I, I know plenty of guys. 40, 50. Yeah. Weekly games. Forget poker. It’s, 00:56:24 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s too much of a commitment for me now initially. So I’ve always wanted to make a game that could help produce the magic and joy and frankly, I mean, sort of the like cognitive training of d and DI think DD is just an incredible game. Kudos to, you know, TSR and Gary Ax and everybody who’s, who’s created that game. It’s unreal. But if you’re gonna be serious about DD, it’s like being serious about World of Warcraft, right? Like this is your new part-time job. Yeah. I mean, it’s many, many, many hours. So as someone now who’s like, everybody else got a lot going on, maybe I have a dinner with friends and we have an hour afterwards, there’s no way we’re gonna play d and d, right? There’s no way we’re gonna play a complex board game. I was curious to see though, if I could create something, and a lot of the, the podcast is interviewing people I might want to do something with, but that’s unspoken. 00:57:16 So I interviewed Alan Lee, who’s the founder of Exploding Kittens. Yeah. One of the most successful game development companies in the world. And I wanted to see if maybe kind of pulling from my childhood experience, I could create a game with him that would be easy to learn, hard to master, very, very fun for families, friends, whoever. Kind of goofy, but also ideally, and this is yet to be proven. So just to be clear, I’m actually hoping to do a study on this, but that could also possibly be a type of brain training and cognitive training. So I’m like, so 00:57:50 [Speaker Changed] You set the bar really low, right? Yeah. Just easy to learn. Yeah. Hard to master. Incredibly fun. Oh, with all sorts of cognitive benefits. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So, 00:58:00 [Speaker Changed] You know, large, low target. Start, start slow with your first 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Game. Well, that’s why it took two years to land on something. Really. 00:58:06 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. That’s a long time to build what’s effectively a simple, I have a copy of this at home and you guys also sent me a copy here, so I want to open this up and go over it with, but give the listeners a quick explanation of exactly what this game is about. 00:58:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So the game Coyote, it’s called Coyote because of the sort of trickster, deity association and a lot of mythologies, also uniquely American Coyote or North American, I should say. It’s, it’s a, it’s very much a sort of new Americas animal, but the Trier piece is important. So Coyote is a game, you can think of it as rock paper, scissors in a group on steroids with many different hilarious movements and gestures. And basically you can play competitively where it’s last person standing wins or you can play as a team collaboratively. There are reasons that we had both options, but the basic gist is it’s a rhythmic game where you’re going around in a circle and you’re, each player’s dealing out cards that make a sequence of gestures harder and more confusing and more hilarious, and you each get three lives and last person standing in competitive mode wins. That’s it. So you can play, I have friends who’ve played with their, like 6-year-old daughters. Even though the box says 10 years old, it’s, it’s very challenging. When it gets challenging, I guess it’s 10 minutes a game, roughly, probably. Right. So pretty low lift, but if you wanna get good at it, you can play it over and over and over and over again. Every game’s gonna be totally different. 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] One of the things I was kind of fascinated by watching the gameplay was it’s a combination of words and gestures that you have to recall and do an order while there’s the rhythmic noise going on at, at the same time that you’re creating. Tell us a little bit about how you guys came up with this and, and what was it like collaborating with Exploding kittens? 01:00:08 [Speaker Changed] We tried dozens of different prototypes before getting to this one, and we were kind of stuck because the question that I was asking myself was the wrong question. The question I was asking myself is, what types of board games or card games do I enjoy? And that didn’t get, I mean, your answers are only gonna be as good as your questions. Right. And that wasn’t working. We had done various brainstorming sprints and like La New York, long Island, and then flew to Canada to spend time with the co-founder exploiting kittens. And we did our last sprint. It was like, okay, look, we’ve been at this for a while. We’re either gonna land on something or let’s call, call it quits and just call a spade of spade. 01:00:48 [Speaker Changed] So a little pressure on at the end. 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, deadlines, you know, the magic of deadlines and expanded it to what games of any type have you enjoyed? And I, this might make me sound like a simple tin, but like having drinks and playing rock paper scissors with your dumb friends is I think very entertaining. Side note, especially if you try to do it with water in your mouth, try that with a friend. But 01:01:13 [Speaker Changed] What does water in your mouth affect? Rock, paper, 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] Scissors. When, when people laugh, they spit water all over themselves. So I, it makes it increasingly challenging, especially if people have had a few drinks, not recommending everybody drink. So we started with that as this building block. It’s like, okay, well how can we make that group play? And then I was interested in the cognitive stuff, as I mentioned, and this is, look, I haven’t proven this, but I I think it’s, it’s quite similar. You’re looking at like interference effects. There are things like the Wisconsin card sorting test, blah, blah, blah, and exploding kittens. They have an amazing track record. The whole company started with this game, exploding Kittens, which was I think the largest Kickstarter of all time. Wow. At that point in time, the leaders of the company are still game designers. So it’s not a huge bureaucratic thing run by no offense to middle managers. They’re important, but it’s like people who are managers versus makers, like the people who run the company are still some of the best in the world at creating games. Right. Elon Lee was involved with developing Xbox. He’s been involved with creating entirely new genres of games, just a genius at, at creating games. So it’s been a blast. Their team is awesome. They’re scrappy, you know, it’s relatively small. Like they really punch above their weight class. 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] Still a startup, nimble able to, 01:02:32 [Speaker Changed] It feels, yeah. It feels like a startup. Like what they do with the number of people they have is just astonishing. It’s been awesome. 01:02:39 [Speaker Changed] I get a sense that because you’re such a thoughtful person, anytime you enter a new sphere, part of you sort of floats above your body and says, what’s going on in this space? Yeah, totally. I, I’ve had that experience in publishing. Yeah. Like, wait, I don’t understand the book industry. Why, why do they behave this way? So I have to ask you that question about the game industry. Sure. When you’re looking at, at gaming generally, what was your experience like going into not only an entirely new space that you haven’t worked in in the past, but like, did you kinda look at the game industry and say, Hey, this whole place is just wacky and so different from everything else? 01:03:26 [Speaker Changed] All of the above. And I, I treated doing something like the game as I treat the startups. So it’s, if I make no money on this, will the relationships developed and the skills and knowledge be something I would pay for? Right. Would I actually pay 01:03:41 [Speaker Changed] Tuition? 01:03:42 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. Would I pay tuition for what I’m going to learn? And the answer is yes. Right. Ilan Lee genius. The people like blinks amazing, by the way. You want a scrappy creative team. If you’re gonna deal with things like tariffs, by the way, are 01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] Are tar do tariffs, I mean, I’m sure assuming these are manufactured somewhere outside of the United States. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are, do you have to pay tariffs on 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh, every, every gaming company in the US pretty much tabletop game is getting smashed. Really? Yep. So you want people who are creative and can think outside the box. Hmm. For something like that, from the implications of something like that to contending with mass, mass retail, like Walmart and Target, for 01:04:21 [Speaker Changed] Instance. Yeah. You’re, you’re, you’re at Walmart, you’re at Target, you’re on Amazon. Yeah. These are challenging retailers to get shelf space, quote unquote from, oh, next 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] To how did that happen to next to Impossible. 01:04:32 [Speaker Changed] And yet you hit, that’s the whole, you hit for the, for the cycle. Walmart, target, yeah. Amazon. Where else is what’s 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Left? If I’m gonna do it, my, you know, my, this is my maybe one and only game, and if my name’s gonna be on it, I need to be very happy with it. And so 01:04:47 [Speaker Changed] How did you guys manage to penetrate that? 01:04:49 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’ll, I’ll say first that what’s not gonna work is if you are a sole inventor who comes up with the world’s greatest game, a company like a Walmart or Target is not equipped, rightly so, to deal with thousands of independent game designers who don’t understand retail, don’t understand margins, don’t understand supply chain management, don’t understand net payment terms and returns and all of these things. So if you want to have a seat at the table or even a chance to have a seat at the table, you need to, I think this is fair to say, partner with someone who already has shelf space and multiple SKUs so that you can be added to the lineup. And that was another reason to partner with someone like an exploiting kittens. And yes, you can do a lot online and the game is on Amazon. It’s been exclusive at Walmart for the first few months. 01:05:39 And then the social video plays, like you mentioned, went completely nuts. And it’s actually now past 300 million. So it just keeps going and going and going, wow. The, the videos of people playing this game. But you can do a lot that is, say, direct to consumer via an Amazon or just your website or Kickstarter. But it’s very easy for techies to underestimate just how incredibly powerful and widely distributed the Walmarts and Targets of the world are. Sure. I mean, 90% of the US is within 10 miles of one of those or 15 minutes. Wow. It’s, I mean, even the food security of the United States depends on these companies. 01:06:16 [Speaker Changed] And you price this at 9 99. Yeah, less than 10 bucks. Very reasonable. Yep. I’m gonna assume at if, if this game is as successful as you hope it will be. And early indications are that it, it can be, you could come up with a second pack, a different focus. 01:06:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Expansion packs something completely different. Maybe I try a more complicated, like role-playing game, something like that. Who knows. But in my case, right, with something like this, I’m used to kind of tiptoeing into things and testing the waters and 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] No, no, you’re jumping in z 01:06:50 [Speaker Changed] The jump band. I mean, even with say the four hour work week, it’s like, had I land on that title, I split tested all of the titles and subtitles on Google AdWords and then looked at the outlier that was many standard deviations away from the rest. And that was the four hour work week. So like that’s how I, huh. I don’t like taking risks. I actually think of myself as a risk mitigator, but in this case, 01:07:11 [Speaker Changed] I’m fascinated by that. ’cause Yeah, you very much strike me as someone who has embraced risk his whole career. Yeah. While rationalizing the potential downside. I don’t, I don’t wanna play pop psychologist, but, but you not somebody, it’s like, alright, I’m starting out as a studying biology. No, no. I’m pivoting to Asian studies. I’m living in Japan. I’m stopping what I’m doing to write a book. Oh, now I’m gonna pivot to startups. Yeah. That is not the life experience of a someone who’s risk averse. 01:07:45 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I would on one hand agree with you. On the other hand, I would say I think that most risks are incredibly overblown. I would put agree, I would, I would put risks in quotation marks, and not to beat a dead horse, but if you’re choosing what you do, based on what you’re gonna learn, the skills you’re gonna develop, the relationships you’re gonna develop or deepen, it’s very hard to fail over time. So if, if you’re able to be, and this applies to investing, obviously, but like long-term greedy, right? 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Not short-term, greedy. It’s very hard to lose over time. If you’re choosing, let me be very clear. Ideally, areas where you would pay tuition projects, where you would pay tuition for those things with relationships or skills that can transfer outside of that one project, which I’m always doing. And if you do that, like with Coyote, okay, let’s say, let’s just say hypothetically, I don’t think this is gonna happen. ’cause I, I think the tariffs are just a bargaining chip for mineral access. I hope you’re right. And other things that’ll be traded with 01:08:47 [Speaker Changed] China. That’s specific my thinking. I’m on the same page as you. Let’s hope that this is just a negotiating tack. 01:08:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, otherwise we’re, we’re also like cutting off our nose to spite our face. Yes. I’m just so interdependent. So it’s, it’s, it’s a bargaining chip. I don’t expect that to continue. But let’s just say that tariffs put every game company in the US out of business, except for one or two. Then will this still have been worth my time? Absolutely. 100%. Because I have no, I’m not getting an advance for this. I’m doing a profit share. Right. I want, I want incentives to be fully, fully aligned. 01:09:21 [Speaker Changed] I, I did the same thing with my book. I don’t want an advance. I wanna see what our upside there is. Yeah. By the way, I really have to push back. This is just me. Maybe there’s a little push. 01:09:31 [Speaker Changed] I love it. 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] Maybe there’s a little projection. You are not risk averse. You really aren’t. And I love the way you’ve rationalized or it’s not an excuse, it’s an explanation. It’s like 01:09:45 [Speaker Changed] Reframing it. Yeah. 01:09:46 [Speaker Changed] You, you’ve framed this into, well, I’m gonna take this risk, but I’m hedged because my downside is I get skills, I get knowledge, I get people and, and relationships. So the worst case scenario is all these good things happen. Yep. You are very much a risk embracer. 01:10:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and also if you look at my projects, it’s, it’s not a sequence of start, finish, start finish, start finish. It’s more like a Gantt chart where things are overlapping. So you look at this game, it’s like, yeah, I put a ton, I’ve been involved with every, every single possible aspect of this game. We play tested it with a hundred plus families, blah, blah, blah. But podcast is still going. The books are still producing royalties. Right. I still have angel investments and therefore I very rarely have all of my eggs in one basket. 01:10:35 [Speaker Changed] So two last questions on the game before we’ll get to our speed round. Yeah. First, this is obviously a low tech card game. Yep. Was this a purposeful decision to avoid screens to not create more screen time? Yeah, 01:10:52 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. I would say, if I look at the mental health of my audience, let’s just call it 20 million people a month or something over the last 10 years, the degree of like depression, anxiety, nihilism is shocking to see, especially in my audience, which is typically antithetical to those things. Right. Maybe not depression, but very optimistic. 01:11:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. There’s a little self-selection there. Hey, I have this issue, Tim seems to figure this out. Yeah. Let me work my way there. There 01:11:19 [Speaker Changed] There’s a little bit of that. But if you look at, let’s just say the writing of, you know, Derek Thompson made it amazing writer at The Atlantic who does a lot more, 01:11:27 [Speaker Changed] No longer at the Atlantic. Now he has his own substack. Yeah. 01:11:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s right. He went full in on Substack. And actually this piece I think is from Substack, but it was effectively, I think it’s simply Americans need to have more fun. But it talk 01:11:39 [Speaker Changed] The decline of partying in America. That’s right. 01:11:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That effectively, I think it’s something atrocious like one in 25 families or people have social plans in person for any given weekend and it’s down for certain. Is 01:11:54 [Speaker Changed] That right? Yeah. That’s 01:11:55 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. And it’s down for certain age brackets. 70% in the last 10 years. And I really feel like digital isn’t inherently bad, but the dose makes the poison. Yes. And, and I think that if digital excess is the problem, then analog is the antidote. I really feel like people need to interact with other humans. We’re not evolved for pure screen time. We are not. Period. 01:12:21 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. You’re a hundred percent. So last question on the game. Yeah. What are your expectations for this? How do you define success? And I’m gonna prevent you from saying I’ve already succeeded due to my collaboration, the whole experience I give you. Give you a experience on that. Hold that aside. Yeah. What’s your minimum expectations and what would surprise you? To the upside 01:12:40 [Speaker Changed] Minimum expectation is that this finds a small band of diehard lovers of the game. Everybody should read 1000 True Fans by Kevin Kelly. Just go to kk.org. It’s free. Read that. That would be super gratifying. But also, I always aim high. So I, I mean I want this to be the bestselling game at all of the major retailers. That’s incredibly hard to do, by the way. I mean 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s, that’s millions of units. 01:13:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean you’re dealing with tens of millions, the Unos and the behemoths of the space. Right? So to do that is incredibly hard. That’s what I’m aiming for. I think that the products, you know, the game can stand on its own two feet. Like people do love this game. And the reason I like to do that is not because I wanna set myself up for disappointment, but as I think it’s Larry Page of Google has said what people miss is it’s very hard to fail completely. If I aim for that and I’m 50% short, I’m still having had the excitement and the motivation and potential payoff of that huge goal, it’s still gonna exceed my expectations that I would’ve had 01:13:51 [Speaker Changed] A year or two. And just moving into a different space is its own rewards. ’cause it’s so, yeah. You know, it really exercises different parts of the brain than you normally get to, to play 01:14:00 [Speaker Changed] With. It’s, it’s also easy to pigeonhole yourself or get pigeonholed. Which is why after the success of the four Hour work week bought me permission to write more books. I didn’t do the three hour work week. I, I didn’t do the four hour work week for, you know, the sort of single mother soul or whatever. I didn’t do these line extensions ’cause I didn’t want to get pigeonholed as a business author. That’s why I did the Four Hour Body and everything on athletic performance because I wanted to be in a different category in the bookstore to see if my readers would follow me. And as soon as I proved to myself that was the case, and to publishers, well, you know, when I hit number one New York Times and blah blah blah, then I could write about whatever I wanted. And so this is another way of testing that, you know, could I play in a completely different sandbox. 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] So before we get to our five favorite questions, I’ve pulled a few of your questions that either you ask on your pod or other people have asked you. And let’s do this as a speed round and see, lets do it. See 01:14:56 [Speaker Changed] How many it, I’ll try to keep my answer shorter. 01:14:58 [Speaker Changed] Right. Tell us about a hundred dollars or less purchase that has positively impact your life. Be specific. 01:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I will be specific. Now I’m gonna put in one shameless plug, which is, if people want to figure out this game, just go to coyote game.com. Okay. Back to our regular programming. Two things I would say that have impacted me in the last year would be, there’s something called the Alpha Ball, which is from Tuneup Fitness. And this is something you can use for soft tissue work, for a sore back, for dealing with your IT bands, anything. And it’s much better than a foam roller because you can really get into specific spots. It’s very easy to use. You can use it against a wall instead of laying on the floor. And it’s small enough to travel with. So I’d say the Alpha Ball is one, have that my luggage right now because I’m traveling. And then the other one is actually a meditation app called The Way. And it’s taught by someone named Henry Shukman. And it’s more or less a zen type of meditation. Full disclosure, I ended up becoming an advisor to these guys. ’cause I love, I ended up loving the app so much, but I use that once or twice a day. 10 minutes each session. And it’s teaching you sort of a 01:16:14 [Speaker Changed] Guided meditation, is that right? 01:16:16 [Speaker Changed] It’s a it, they’re guided meditations, but it’s a sequence of practical skills that you’re developing that you can apply outside of meditation, which is why I like it so much. So I’d say those are two that immediately come to mind. 01:16:29 [Speaker Changed] So you’ve spent your whole career delving into new areas, learning new skills and learning them quickly. What’s your favorite cheat code for that? 01:16:39 [Speaker Changed] Favorite cheat code is probably picking the skills in the first place. So what I mean by that is if you want to get the best golf coach in the world, you might not be able to afford it. You probably can’t afford it. It’s gonna be, it’s a very common sport. There are a lot of wealthy people involved. It’s gonna be hard to get direct instruction from somebody who’s top of the field. But if you choose, say almost anything, swimming, archery, whatever it might be. And you look for say, not gold medalists, but silver medalists. Right. Who are by the way, frequently just as good. They 01:17:17 [Speaker Changed] Just, right. It’s the 10th of a second. They, they 01:17:19 [Speaker Changed] Just, yeah. They just, they exactly. They just got 10 minutes less sleep than the other person that day. You can get some of the people who are best in the world to teach you at, at a cost that is next to nothing. So I would say that number one is picking, coming back to that definition that we talked about with the four hour work week with business and entrepreneurship, like picking the goal first. The second is looking at frequency of use. So for languages, for instance, a lot of people just dive into learning languages. Well I think that material beats method, in other words, like picking what you’re gonna learn very carefully is more important, at least in sequence than choosing how you’re gonna do it. A lot of people ask like, what’s the best way to learn X? And I’m like, first of all, you should ask what should I learn? And you can look at word frequency lists and things like that. And for a language like Spanish, Japanese, whatever, find the 1000 or 1500 most frequently used words. You can learn that in a few weeks. 01:18:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Duolingo du part of 01:18:17 [Speaker Changed] Your Duolingo is outstanding. I mean, of course I’m biased ’cause I invested in their first round. I, 01:18:21 [Speaker Changed] We just were in Paris three years ago, Amsterdam two years ago, Rome last year. And Duolingo, just for those basic phrases is amazing. 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s great. You can, I mean, I’ve used it for Korean as well to refresh my Korean, which I studied in school. Yeah. And 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] That’s a tough language, right? 01:18:38 [Speaker Changed] It’s tough. The grammar’s almost identical to Japanese. So I’ve a leg up there. But by the way, like people, if there’s a cartoon, I think it’s like learning how to read Korean 15 minutes. There’s a comic book that literally will teach you how to read Korean. You won’t understand what the hell you’re reading, but you’ll be able to sound out phonetically Korean. And like, it’s a bit of an exaggeration. I’d say it probably takes an hour. But Duolingo is very well designed and I, I have seen every possible language startup. My fans sent me that one. By the way, my fans also recommended that I connect with Shopify ’cause they knew I I was interested in eCommerce. Huh. So a lot of my best deals have come from my, my readers and my, my listeners. But the Duolingo came about ’cause they were enclosed beta. And a number of my fans reached out and said, you have to try this really? And so I got access and I looked at it and I was like, oh yeah, this is fundamentally different from everything else I’ve seen. 01:19:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us an example of an unusual habit or just absurd thing that you love. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] I like repeating numbers. Could be the OCD. Go ahead. So I take a screenshot whenever I see five fifty five on my phone. So I have hundreds of screenshots of typically 5:55 PM I just love repeating those specific, repeating numbers. I a lot of folks like 1111, nothing against 1111. I think that’s, that’s perfectly fine. But I’m just more of a 5, 5, 5 guy. 01:19:59 [Speaker Changed] Those 11, 11 people, they don’t know what’s up. It’s all about, have you seen the old style analog almost neon tubes that are clocks? 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Yes, I 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Have. They like what happens when that rolls over to 1111? Do you see something like that? And just shrug and like 01:20:16 [Speaker Changed] 5, 5, 5. I still find it pleasant. I like symmetry. So 1111 has the advantage over 5, 5, 5 that it is pleasingly symmetrical. Like this old friend I used to have Mike Kim, his name is a palindrome. It’s the 01:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Same. Right? I was gonna say 5, 5, 5 is a palindrome, but it’s not truly symmetrical vis 01:20:36 [Speaker Changed] Visually. Exactly. Yeah. 01:20:38 [Speaker Changed] So, so there is, we were talking there a diversion earlier. One of the things I kind of was shocked to learn in the A DHD world is why people will play a song over and over and over again because it tickles a part of their brain that is relevant to certain emotional expressions that tend to be more difficult or absence. And it, it makes that like, oh, you’re getting that feedback that you, you haven’t been able to get in the real world. It sounds like the 5 5 5 and the 1111 tickles a similar part of the brain. Yeah, 01:21:16 [Speaker Changed] It could be. I think for me there’s just something soothing about repetition. I don’t know what it is. I mean, it’s why, you know, I mentioned archery, like I love archery and for most people 01:21:25 [Speaker Changed] Archery. 01:21:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I love archery and also language learning for most, for a lot of, there’s a lot of repetition involved. And for many people, and I think this is fair, they cannot imagine something more boring than going through conjugations or doing archery. Which by the way, if you’re doing it at a high level, you are effectively trying to do exactly the same thing over and over again. 01:21:51 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that true for any particular athletic skill? I mean the variations multiply. You have basketball, you have five people on, on five people. Yeah. And so just extrapolate that out exponentially. And there are a million variations, the same with chess, whatever. But it really doesn’t matter. Each particular play move step is you’re trying to optimize that and do precisely what you need. Even something like darts. But there are so many variations to your musculature. Your, your thought process is any sport boring hitting a tennis ball? Yeah. I mean, it’s the same stroke over and over again. But there’s a bajillion variations of what can happen. 01:22:34 [Speaker Changed] That’s true. Which makes it interesting with archery, you’re standing in one place shooting at the same thing. Right. Thousands of times. Right. 01:22:42 [Speaker Changed] Any sharp shooting riflery darts, it’s go, go down the list’s 01:22:45 [Speaker Changed] Gonna be highly repetitive. Right Now I like the other sports too, like tennis. I would say that also confusingly, if people are interested in the accelerated learning stuff, the, the, my third book, the Four Hour Chef is basically a book on accelerated learning disguised as a cookbook. So it get, it gets into like how to learn, how to shoot three pointers, language learning, all this stuff. You can get a lot further. For instance, I think number one, adults can learn languages faster than children actually really 01:23:13 [Speaker Changed] With, if you, that, that is very an opposite to accepted wisdom. 01:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I I absolutely believe adults can learn languages more quickly than kids with a few constraints applied. And just a couple of systems. I mean, I, I really think for, for a native English speakers, for say a romance language or something that isn’t too far flung, like Chinese is gonna be different, but eight weeks you can be conversationally pretty fluent, like pretty functional if you were to carve out not three hours a week. That’s where kids have the advantage is that they’re forced to do it all the time. And they have no choice. They have no mortgage, they have no job. That’s right. But, but if you were to put in say, 10 hours a week and take it really seriously, eight to 12 weeks, you could be very functional. 01:24:02 [Speaker Changed] Very fluent. 01:24:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Like you could get around and have like a, a conversation for 10 to 15 minutes with someone. 01:24:08 [Speaker Changed] Wow. Let’s jump to our favorite five questions. We ask all of our guests. Starting really simple. What are you streaming these days? Give us your favorite Netflix, Amazon Prime or podcast. What, what’s keeping you entertained? 01:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, I just finished the last of us, which I thought was spectacularly well done. Especially as an adaptation from a video game. I am very interested in Korean animation because I saw a film on Netflix called Lost in Starlight, which absolutely blew my mind. Just the lost 01:24:40 [Speaker Changed] In Starlight. 01:24:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The, the, the quality and the visual beauty of this animation made my head spin. Because you don’t, well I think most people do not associate South Korea with animation. You might think of Japan. 01:24:54 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that where most of our low-cost animation is coming from over the past? Well that’s not CGI. 01:24:59 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s a lot of lower cost animation. Yes. But when you think of, say, cinematic right. Animation and Studio Gili out of Japan, let’s just say people tend to think of Disney, Pixar, studio Ojibwe. And I think Korea’s gonna be a powerhouse for high quality feature length animation. We’ll see, we, we shall see. But Lost in Starlight is a, is a recent fave. And then I’ve got some weird ones. Like there’s a German language documentary on fasting that I found on YouTube. You can’t watch it in the US but you can use A VPN to, 01:25:33 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say you could watch anything anyway. Yeah. 01:25:35 [Speaker Changed] You can use, you can use A VPN to pretend like you’re in Germany and then you can watch it and just use the automatic 01:25:40 [Speaker Changed] Subtitle. What’s the name of that one? 01:25:42 [Speaker Changed] Oh, some long German name. I’m just getting started with it. So unfortunately I can’t remember. But it’s, it’s looking at specifically someone who did, I wanna say a two to three week supervised fast at the Wilhelmina Institute, who has fasted many, many, many thousands of people. I, I have some bones to pick with their approach, but I, I nonetheless find that they have such a huge data set, really fascinating. So I’m looking at that one. And then podcasts, I found a new podcast recently called STEM Talk, which features interviews with scientists mostly. And I’ve listened to an interview with someone named Kevin Tracy, T-R-A-C-E-Y, who is a very widely cited scientist who’s arguably the most credible researcher who has established a lot related to the vagus nerve and vagus nerve stimulation. Sure. There’s, there’s a lot of BS and pseudoscience and nonsense floating around. He is a real signal amongst the noise. So I’m listening to a bunch of STEM talk different scientists on STEM talk. Huh. And the, the interviewers are outstanding. It, 01:26:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting you referenced YouTube because mostly starting in the pandemic, but just ramping up since then, I wanna say it’s become 50, 60% of my Yeah. Television viewing. It’s amazing how 01:27:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s also great for finding documentaries that you can’t find anywhere else. Right. So I think there’s a documentary. I, I’m the name is something like Learning How to See or The Art of Seeing, and it’s about David Hockney. 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Oh, 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Okay. 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Big fan. The 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Spectacular documentary. It’s grainy, but you can find it on YouTube. And I, I I was not able to find it anywhere else. 01:27:30 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Amazing. You mentioned one of your mentors earlier. Tell us about who your mentors were and how they helped shape your career. 01:27:39 [Speaker Changed] Early mentors Steven Gork. He was a martial arts instructor when I was probably 12, 13. Just from the perspective of physical and mental toughness. ’cause the class was all adults and then it was me. They did not take it easy on me. And I was very grateful for that. They weren’t abusive, but they treated me like an adult who was training for, for real. And I think from a toughness perspective, he, he always reiterated that I could do more than I thought I could do. Much like my wrestling coach in high school, John Buxton, who even to this day, many of his wrestlers have gone on to do amazing things and they all reference back to him then Ed Chao, who is that professor in high tech entrepreneurship in Princeton. There are other people who indirectly or pretty directly, although they wouldn’t have expected it informed later what I did. For instance, John McPhee, amazing, amazing nonfiction writer who staff writer for the New Yorker. He is got at least one Pulitzer Prize for coming into the country, I think. And he taught a class at Princeton’s seminar called The Literature Fact, which was on nonfiction writing. And I took 01:28:52 [Speaker Changed] The literature of fact, what a great name. 01:28:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that class in terms of thinking about structure, how to structure writing, which by the way helps you structure your thinking. So all of my grades in my other classes went up when I took that class. It was no kidding. It was wild to see. Huh. And I’m sure there are many more. I mean, right after graduation, Mike Maples Jr. In terms of teaching me the ropes of Angel investing. That that’s 01:29:16 [Speaker Changed] A good, good starter list for 01:29:18 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s a pretty good roster. I was very lucky. Let’s 01:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:29:25 [Speaker Changed] Some of my favorites would be Letters from a Stoic, which is by Marcus Seneca. Seneca in this case, meditation’s by Marcus as well. So letters from Stoic by Seneca for thriving in a high stress, high conflict world. I think that Stoicism, particularly as communicated by Seneca, is very, very, very present and applicable. And frankly fun to read too. Although that might sound odd. Applied to stoicism. So Letters from Stoic, I would say Vagabonding, a book by Rolfe Pots. I think the subtitle is The Uncommon Art of Long-Term World Travel, which is really, it’s a book on long-term travel, but it’s a book on, it’s a Phil philosophical treatise too. That’s a great fun read. Those are, those are two faves that come to mind. One More Awareness by Anthony Dello, I believe the subtitle is The Promises and Perils of Reality. It’s, it’s just about becoming more aware. So taking yourself out of the automatic loops that we all have and adopt from parents and so on. Really good book. It’s like 120 pages. And then in terms of what I’m reading right now, I just started a book called The Great Nerve, which is by Kevin Tracy, that scientist I mentioned. And it’s all about, on Vegas, it’s all about the vagus nerve research related to vagus nerve stimulation, et cetera. 01:30:56 [Speaker Changed] What’s the book that you’ve given most as a gift and why? 01:31:00 [Speaker Changed] The books I’ve given most as a gift includes some of the books that I mentioned. And if you, if someone were to stay at my guest bedroom in my house, I have shelves. Each shelf just has 15 copies of these books and I take one 01:31:14 [Speaker Changed] With you. 01:31:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, take, take, take whatever you like. So I would say that’s a great idea. I love that. It’s fun. It’s also very visually pleasing for someone like me. So the same, same, great. It’s very, very, very aesthetically pleasing. So Awareness by Anthony Dello for sure. I’ve gifted hundreds of copies of this book, letters from stoic, hundreds of copies of that book back in the day. Now there are a million copies, or I shouldn’t say a million copies now. There are a million different books on the subject of psychedelics and psychedelic history, psychedelic science, but How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollen. For a while I had that in my room because I got early galleys of that book and have since ended up doing a bunch of collaborations with, with Michael, who’s amazing. But otherwise, I also gift my friends who are nonfiction purists who are too busy to meditate, too busy to read fiction. 01:32:07 I tend to give them books of poetry because I’m like, you need to slow down and if you feel like you can’t meditate for 10 minutes a day, you need to meditate for an hour a day. That type of, that type of logic leads me to give them a very short collection of, for instance, there’s a, a new translation of Rumi poetry, relatively new called Gold by Hala. Liza GRI is her name, who’s incredible. She’s based in New York City and native, native speaker also who’s able to go to the source material. So gold, which is a new compilation of short roomy poetry that is well translated. Unlike a lot of versions you might find. It’s like a hundred pages. And I just say to my friend, I’m like, look, don’t read this A to Z, just read one before you go to bed every night. And those are probably the most gifted in the last handful of years. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] That, that sounds really interesting. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in fill in the blank, writing, podcasting, seed investing, game design. What would you tell them? 01:33:25 [Speaker Changed] If, if it’s nonfiction book writing, I would say, number one, are you really sure you want to do that? It’s not, it’s not, don’t assume it’s a good way to make money. ’cause generally it’s not. But I would say also, if it’s a recent grad, I would say if you’re gonna write nonfiction, probably go do something interesting before you try to write something interesting. That would be my advice. That’s what, you know, very fair. That’s what John McFee does. That’s what many folks have done. It’s like I get some life experience doing something first and then write about it would probably be my recommendation in the realm of investing finance, I would say that probably ensure you have an informational behavioral or network, meaning relationship advantage with whatever you choose to do. Unless you’re gonna do something like lowcost index funds, which I think actually are a great idea for a lot of people. And I, I myself also invest in very, very low cost index funds. 01:34:31 [Speaker Changed] That’s your core. You could build, you know, that’s your tree. You could throw some ornaments around it. 01:34:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, yeah, exactly. I wanna like keep your risk capital and your retirement capital separate. 01:34:42 [Speaker Changed] What do you know about the world today that would’ve been useful to know 25 years or so ago when you graduated? 01:34:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I’ll throw out a few. So the first would be from an investing perspective, you don’t need to compete in the public markets. Like you can learn a ton through being around startups or even very unsexy private sector stuff. And you can get very, very wealthy doing that. So you, you don’t have to compete against the citadels in the world. Like, I don’t wanna do that, or the rentech or whatever. Like, I like that’s bringing a knife to a gunfight. I don’t wanna deal with that. So I would say also 01:35:20 [Speaker Changed] Look for white space that you are, you can create your own area where you’re a pioneer. Not going into well trot space. Yeah, 01:35:30 [Speaker Changed] I would also say invest in what you know, and that sounds so trite, but the first, the first stock I ever bought was when I was in my teens and it was, I think it was in my teens, might have been a little bit later, but it was Pixar because I knew the world of animation. I was like, oh, this is so fundamentally different. Like this is gonna change everything. That’s it. That’s all I knew that. And so I, I would say that sort of investing from the perspective of watching main behavior on Main Street more than Wall Street is actually can be a really viable approach. And then in the world at large, I would say for me personally, 30 years ago, I would’ve said like your current experience of mental health and the buggy code that you inherited from your parents, God bless them. But like, you know, there are some bugs in the code is not a sort of psychological death sentence. Like you can actually change those things because you can, you really can impact those things and, 01:36:34 [Speaker Changed] And you’re living proof. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] I am living proof. And I would say that, you know, science, science is such an amazing tool, like the framework of science so necessary for not fooling ourselves. And within the world of medicine, especially psych, I don’t wanna throw psychiatry under the bus, but within the realm of medicine, I mean, anyone who’s worth their salt will say something along the lines of like, 50% of what we know is wrong. We just don’t know which 50%. And when I was growing up, I mean there were so many definitive statements about like, alright, you’re born with this number of neurons and when they die, they die. And that’s it. You can never regenerate these types of things. Totally false. And I feel like many of our assumptions about psychiatry, psychology, emotional health will be overturned in the next five years. It’s gonna happen fast. 01:37:27 [Speaker Changed] Thank you Tim, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Tim Ferris, author, podcaster, angel investor.
