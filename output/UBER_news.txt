Elon Musk has become as much the face of Donald Trump’s presidency as Trump himself. Musk speaks at Cabinet meetings, sits down with Sean Hannity as Trump’s equal, and takes reporters’ questions from the Oval Office. He walks around like he owns the place, not wearing a suit—now a big deal, apparently!—and letting his son use him as a human jungle gym as he stands a few steps away from where Trump sits. Musk has garnered lots of attention for this power move. Some is positive. Most is not. Tesla, his biggest company, has become the subject of widespread boycotting calls by his and Trump’s opponents. There are frequent protests outside of Tesla showrooms. Barely a day passes without the viral egging of a Cybertruck. Tesla owners are getting international press attention for flipping their cars at a loss just to get rid of them. “I’m selling the Nazi mobile,” one dissatisfied driver says. The social internet might create an outsized impression of how common those acts of resistance are, but they still seem at least reflective of a shift. Public approval of Musk’s government obliteration really is low, and disapproval of Tesla itself is higher than ever. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock price is declining rapidly. Musk’s largest company lost 24 percent of its value in February. It was the stock’s second worst month ever, and then it fell another 3 percent on Monday, the first trading day of March. What a coincidence it would be if none of that had anything to do with the ever-growing, controversial public persona of its very famous chief executive. Big left-of-center social media accounts are celebrating their work: “Congrats, everyone—the Elon boycott is working!” a Bluesky post from a mysterious account with 800,000 followers reads. How much of that is wishful thinking by liberals desperate for a win, and how much is the anti-Musk resistance already notching wins? We know from recent history that Musk’s intense focus on non-Tesla projects can be a drag on Tesla’s stock. We also know that the stock can go back up rapidly without Musk dialing back his obnoxiousness or giving up his other projects. We do not know how much of the electric car company’s recent tanking owes to opposition to Musk personally and how much stems from Tesla’s wider business challenges, or how much those two things have to do with each other. In other words: Claiming that Tesla boycotts have hurt Musk any worse than a bee sting is speculative cope—but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The job, as Kobe Bryant once said, is not finished. People don’t fill out a questionnaire every time they sell Tesla stock, so we don’t know exactly what causes its price to go down. The evidence is strong, though, that Tesla shares trade down when the spotlight shines extra brightly on Musk paying attention to other things. Tesla’s stock began struggling more or less concurrently with Musk launching his bid for Twitter in the spring of 2022. The stock had a very bad year even compared to other American stocks, and Musk’s selling of Tesla shares (and an aborted plan to use Tesla shares as collateral for his bank loans) aggravated the situation. Musk is always very famous and always known to have lots of balls in the air, but he’s not usually as famous as he is right now. To the extent that Americans are aware of what his “government efficiency” initiative is up to, the polling says they are skeptical of it and of Musk specifically. A team of Wedbush Securities analysts, who are bullish on Tesla overall, put it this way in a Feb. 24 note to clients: “The worry of the Street is that Musk dedicating so much time (even more than we expected) to DOGE takes away from his time at Tesla in such a crucial moment and year for the company.” The investment firm thinks Tesla will manage through its Musk-related branding problems and its stock will rebound, but it calls a spade a spade. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and Trump alliance “clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand.” But there are problems with the idea that anti-Musk sentiment is driving Tesla into the ground. The stock had a miserable February but remains up nearly 40 percent over the past six months. Trump’s victory was a win for Tesla’s stock. The day after the election, investment research firm CFRA found that Tesla and Musk “are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump’s victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company’s autonomous driving technology.” Any gains the boycotters have made so far have not outweighed the benefit to Tesla’s stock from having its CEO more or less running the American government. After all, this self-serving domination of our politics is the very genesis of the protests. There is also the distinct possibility that Tesla’s stock just goes up anyway even if Musk never changes his behavior and liberals never bought a Tesla or rode in one when ordering an Uber again. Musk’s obsession with Twitter dragged the stock for a while, but then the car company’s stock shot up to market-beating heights in 2023 and 2024. It’s not as if Musk quieted down or became a less controversial public figure the past two years. Quite the opposite. Tesla’s biggest problems at the end of 2022 were not just about Musk’s reputation, but headwinds in the electric car market and broader economy. The company addressed those worries to Wall Street’s satisfaction, at least for a time. There’s a fair case that this time will be different, though. Musk is now very popular with Republicans, which would be better for Tesla if Republicans bought electric vehicles. But they don’t, perhaps because conservative media and politicians have spent years denigrating EVs whenever possible. Meanwhile, Democrats do buy electric vehicles but, I think it’s safe to say, will increasingly look for EV vendors who are not Elon Musk. Again, that would be less of a problem for Tesla if Republican adoration of Musk converted to more GOP voter enthusiasm for electric cars. “Could Elon Musk move that troublesome GOP needle?” asked Republican political operative Mike Murphy in a February report accompanying a new poll on the issue. “With his hostility to EV consumer subsidies, and the unwelcome market competition for Tesla that it helps create, the early answer is probably not. Elon seems focused on other things now and helping break down GOP hostility to EVs appears to be low on his priority list.” Tesla has other challenges elsewhere. Sales have been bad lately in Europe, where Musk has also done a bunch of political meddling. Increased Chinese competition for EV market share in that country was likely the biggest problem for Tesla’s stock two years ago, and the company is still losing ground there. The company underperformed in new car deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year, before DOGE existed or Musk cosplayed as Benito Mussolini on a podium on Inauguration Day. Federal regulators launched their latest probe into Tesla self-driving technology in the last few days of the Biden administration. Does the federal government still regulate Tesla in any serious way? Maybe not, but other countries reserve their rights to do so, and every news story with the words “investigation” and “self-driving” is bad press. This blend of events leaves the anti-Musk, anti-Tesla forces in a place of opportunity. While it’s a stretch to say that protests and boycott calls were responsible for all of the stock’s drop in February, or even most of it, it’s implausible that they’ve had no effect on investor confidence in the company. Musk is the face of Tesla, and he has polarized himself against the people who are most likely to buy his company’s primary product. That may not hurt Musk in the long run. He could find more customers elsewhere, or he could persuade huge swaths of Republicans that they are saving America by purchasing his electric cars. Moreover, even if huge numbers of people dislike Musk, many of them may not shun Tesla as a result. The link between disdain and action may not form, in the same way that people who don’t like slaughterhouses still eat steak. A recent observation by New York City–based climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis on Bluesky has stuck with me: “I went to the tesla protest for a thing I’m working on and I talked to several onlookers - not protesters - and asked them what they knew about Elon and Doge and I’m telling you people don’t know.” Creating that link in a collective mass of minds requires relentless news coverage and reaching millions of people who do not consume a lot of political news. Right now, people are showing up at Tesla locations and shaming Tesla car owners in an effort to build that attention. It might not be enough, but it’s a more effective and satisfying plan to counter Musk than anything that has so far emerged from most Democrats with power.

Title: The Dean of Student Housing: Why Core Spaces’ Dan Goldberg Invests in Niche Markets

Time Published: 2025-03-03T11:30:20Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Dan Goldberg has charted an unlikely path to become top of his class in the student housing market. A neuroscience major at Brown University, Goldberg fell into a career on Wall Street by accident after teaching tennis to hedge fund legend Marc Lasry, who gave him an internship at Avenue Capital. From there, Goldberg spent 14 years in high finance, splitting his time between Goldman Sachs (GS) and Blackstone (BX), where he acquired $1 billion student housing portfolios and oversaw U.S. core-plus real estate investing. Now Goldberg serves as president of Chicago-based Core Spaces, a vertically integrated real estate investment firm and property manager that specializes in student housing and build-to-rent communities. Core Spaces has a portfolio of more than 45,000 student housing beds and 3,000 single-family, build-to-rent homes, with a business plan committed to innovation and outside-the-box thinking. Goldberg sat down with Commercial Observer to discuss his investment strategy. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: You’ve been involved in student housing for almost 20 years. How did you train yourself to understand this asset class especially at a time when it was not well-known? Dan Goldberg: Well, it’s actually quite intuitive in some ways. In college, I lived in a dilapidated row house with my best friends, and the idea that there could be an option that was turnkey, that was safe, that you didn’t have to go get your utilities lined up or go find furniture on Craigslist, and had a great location seemed to be an obvious thing. Even in those early days there was a lot of fragmentation in the student housing space, and even to someone who at the time was six years out of college, it was painfully evident that it was ripe for disruption if you could build something in a great location or was just purposely built, turnkey. I do think as a value investor that there’s opacity in the space. There’s a lot of local and specific knowledge. These are buildings designed for students that are institutionally run with operating partners that have developed, through their years, very specific knowledge about what makes a good location. If you just look at a map and say, “Oh, this is on campus,” you and I both kind of know that if it’s next to the football stadium at Brown University, that’s actually a mile and a half away from anything you want to be close to, as a student. And so I saw a real value-investing opportunity to work with operating partners that had legitimate informational advances through their experience on the sites. And so kind of collectively that was my pitch, and we went from there. How did you choose the territories or colleges that you felt were ripe for disruption? Walk me through that strategy. I’ve probably been to 65 different college campuses over the last decade, which is part of the job. What we focus on at Core is big flagship public universities, typically ones that are growing. When there’s new supply that’s added, it’s typically a small percentage of the overall enrollment growth, and enrollment is, obviously, demand, so you don’t just have to take people out of that shadowy, fragmented inventory. And, in my view, the value of public education continues to be a steal, especially versus smaller private colleges, which also informs our decision to invest in those schools. For example, the University of Maryland, if you’re [enrolled] in-state or even if you’re out-of-state, it has a great value proposition, you get an incredible education. I don’t think that’s going anywhere, and I think that’s gonna be a staple for years to come, whereas some of these schools that are, you know, maybe top 50 or 100 private schools that cost $70,000 a year, I think there’s more of a threat over time to the value of that education versus the public. And so we generally focus on those types of universities. What is Core Space’s prime investment strategy or ethos? When I was at Goldman, my thesis was those types of [big, public university] markets, but also the best locations. And there were a couple of groups that would build high-rise properties at what we call the bull’s eye — which is equidistant, or walking distance, from the main quad, the main retailer, and the frat houses or social life. If you can find the bull’s eye it’s usually right next to the school bookstore, it’s a great location. So that was the thesis that I had. Core was actually around for almost a decade before I got there, and I met the company founder Marc Lifshin at University of Wisconsin in Madison, which is where one of their first large flagship projects was, and I was immediately inspired. I walked into Core’s asset and there was a music room, there was a volleyball court that turned into an ice skating rink, there was a rooftop infinity pool, and they built these penthouse units that were just a different level of design. And I remember walking around with Marc and saying “This is the nicest asset in the country I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been looking at student housing for years,” And he said, “Well, why don’t you come in a week from now. We screwed up on so many different things, let me tell you about all the lessons we learned. We’re an open book about that.” And so, what brought me to Core, and is still in our DNA, is a culture of relentless innovation and self-criticism, where we wanna push the envelope on design, on the user experience, and we wanna be open and honest about how we can continue to get better. And the student housing demographic and the profile of the renter is constantly changing. So it’s a lot of fun if you’re up for that kind of challenge because you’re always chasing and losing your target as the tenant preferences change. Not every college student has parents that can afford rents for an asset with an ice skating rink. Are these amenities a trend or the future of student housing? We’ve developed a barbell strategy over time, where we have luxury penthouse units, but on the other side of the spectrum, 30 percent to 40 percent of our projects are what are called price sets. At large public universities, there are certain tenants that are pricing sensitive, and some want a penthouse suite. That’s a cool thing to sell, and you’re gonna have people that fill in at that end of the barbell. But some of our projects now are 2,000 beds. We’re obsessed with really well-designed, efficient units that have a price point that’s somewhat commensurate with living on campus, or living a couple of miles away with a little bit more space and less amenities. So how do you differ yourself from the competition? We’re probably more well known for pushing the envelope and innovating a bit more. Let me give you some examples. Our units are more efficient than something our competitors might design, they’re proprietary designs that really haven’t been seen before. You’ve got Murphy beds that come down from the walls, and we’ve taken some bets that other competitors haven’t. We lease those beds in two months. But conventional wisdom in student housing is that you need bed-bath parity, so every bedroom has to have a bathroom. And we like to challenge ourselves and say, “You know what? Some students, especially in the Florida projects, just want a price point.” And so we ask ourselves: How do we create a great living experience that doesn’t necessarily have all of the same things that our competitors feel like are necessary? We are also obsessed with the user experience and also marketing to our students. For example, when we at leased up Knoxville, we partnered with Barstool Sports and [Hall of Fame NFL quarterback] Peyton Manning. And so, we hosted an event bringing Peyton Manning, who’s an alumni of University of Tennessee, together with this really popular podcast on Barstool Sports, and we did kind of a roommate challenge that Peyton and the Barstool team mediated, and it was a huge success. And so other student housing companies aren’t doing that. We own a lot of beds at Clemson University, and in November, we hosted a concert with a top 10 country music singer named Lee Brice in our parking lot. I don’t think any student housing company hosted a full-blown concert before. And then there’s our social media handles. We have a big brand presence in Instagram and one of our videos just hit 12 million views — I don’t understand it at all, but that’s half of all college students in the country, and those type of things differentiate Core in the market. Where do you guys source your capital from, and what do your investment partnerships look like? Most real estate transactions in the operator and developer space are one-off deals, with 60 to 65 percent leverage, where the capital is 5 to 20 percent of the equity, and you find a one-off joint venture partner to be the rest of the equity in the capital stack. And that’s what we’ve done for a long time. We have 17 different institutional capital partners—limited partners right now— in our various joint ventures. But one thing that differentiates us is we started raising closed-end funds, so that’s discretionary development capital. They’re very large discretionary investment funds, and as a company, we’ve invested a lot in fundraising and distribution channels. We have institutional sales fundraisers that have come from Wall Street to help develop more relationships with traditional funds investors, as we see that pocket of capital being a real differentiator for us. You’re also involved in the build-to-rent space. What’s the investment strategy behind those assets? The build-to-rent space feels a lot like cottage-style student housing products, and it feels ripe for disruption right now, where what’s out there doesn’t really suit the needs of people who actually want to have a feeling of a true community. I think there’s 17 million renters of noninstitutional homes right now. Our approach is the anti-”Truman Show” approach, where it feels a little bit like a movie set when you walk around some of these communities of single-family homes. And we want to try to bring our culture of really creating something that’s bespoke and that speaks to the community, but is not just a one-size-fits-all model. We want to create vibrant communities that feel like a very differentiated type of community, and so that’s the approach that we’re taking to a space that we think is ripe for disruption. It costs more to do that. How do you guys justify being different and making the single-family or the build-to-rent home a little more unique? I think some people think that build-to-rent is just for people that have no other options. We call that a rent-by-necessity demographic. But we believe that it’s not just people that can’t afford a house. If you build the right products and the right community, some people want flexibility and convenience, too. And so we are making a bet that some of our demographics, where we’re anywhere from 150 to 400 homes in our communities, where you could have some people that could afford to live in a home, but want the flexibility of a house with zero maintenance hassles. And then there are other homes that are designed really efficiently that have a much lower price point, and everywhere in between. So that’s the way that we’re able to do it. It’s slightly larger projects, which bring down our cost basis, in a belief that some of those units with a barbell strategy are not just renters by need. Do you think most Americans want to be renters of homes rather than owners who can tap into the equity of the homeownership world? For some people, yes. And I think there’s been a traditional wisdom within America that your biggest investment is equity in your house. But it’s a big liquid investment, and there are some people, especially in this Uber generation, where there’s changing preferences, that may want to have the majority of their investments in more liquid assets, like the stock market, and have the ability to move instead of just staying in a job, in the same place, where they have to be in the same house and be stuck in their property, potentially in an economic downturn. Some want to have that flexibility. And I think we believe that it’s not everyone, these are not like absolutes, but there’s a proportion of people, probably a subset of people, that would trade out of the idea of locking in on an investment and having that flexibility. But it’s a big addressable market. And so to us, it’s about being obsessed with the way that we design our spaces. For example, a lot of our competitors, especially the homebuilders, have large dining rooms. We don’t think that a lot of our renting demographic, which is generally aging millennials, are going to want a big formal dining room anymore. And we’re happy to make that bet that we can keep a price point lower on a more efficient home that has an open kitchen floor. These are basic things that we do that are a little different than a lot of competitors. What’s the best investment advice you’ve received in your career in real estate? A partner of mine at Goldman Sachs gave me advice that who you’re investing with probably matters the most. Great management teams are worth their weight in gold. And now that I’m over on the operating side, I can see that the culture, the grit, the collaboration, and the integrity of the teams is what usually differentiates investment success from investment failure.

Title: Tech Insider: A cheap home EV charger that’s made in NZ, AWS’s local financials revealed

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Evnex founder and CEO Ed Harvey outside his firm's Christchurch headquarters and manufacturing plant. Photo / Chris Keall Christchurch’s Evnex releases a home EV charger for the cost-of-living-crisis era. Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, reveals its latest NZ financials. Alexa gets AI smarts. DOGE “cuts” hit Wellington man Peter Griffin. Evnex’s brag line has always been that it’s the maker of the world’s slimmest home EV chargers. Now it’s also a contender for those feeling the cost-of-living pinch, its founder Ed Harvey says. The Christchurch firm’s new E2 Core smart charger is on a $999 launch special, putting it in play in the crowded sub-$1000 bracket. (Installation can double the price, depending on where your switchboard is located and other factors. The same games for all brands, so remember to factor this if you’re shopping around for a home charger.) The E2 Core is a 7-watt model, meaning you can add around 50km of range for every hour your EV (electric vehicle) is plugged in (the exact amount will vary by make and model; most EVs are supported). There’s an app and Wi-Fi support, and the ability to automatically delay charging until off-peak rates kick in. Harvey says the emphasis is on building a system that will appeal to the second wave of EV buyers, who’re often less technical than the early adopters. An E2 Plus model ($1299) adds frills, including support for Tesla features. Higher up the Evnex food chain, the E7 ($2065) offers 11W charging for around 75km of range per hour or 22W for about 120km of range for every hour your EV is plugged in. Harvey founded Evnex in Christchurch in 2014, after he converted his 1997 Honda Accord to electric power as a university project. The company is now New Zealand’s biggest manufacturer of EV chargers and software, and has recently expanded into Australia in 2023. He says Evnex has sold 8000 chargers over its lifetime and is set to double that amount over the next 18 months. Manufacturing will stay in Christchurch, and Evnex will stick to incorporating recycled materials and using printed circuit boards made by another Christchurch company, GPC Electronics. Harvey is loyal to the city. And he adds, candidly, that his firm just doesn’t have the scale to make it worth retooling for a Chinese plant. Regardless, “It only takes 20 minutes to assemble one of our chargers,” he says. “That’s pretty efficient.” Beyond Made in NZ and environmental appeal, Evnex is a charging partner for several new-vehicle brands including Polstar, Volkswagen, Volvo, Skoda, Cupra, Subaru and LDV in New Zealand. So for example Polestar (sold by Giltrap Group) pushes the Evnex chargers on its website and offers its buyers special pricing. Harvey spoke to the Herald from Sydney, where he’s now spending a lot of his time. There are five reasons. Despite some trimming, Australia still offers incentives for buying an EV (which vary by state). And there are no road user charges for EV owners (Victoria tried, but had its effort struck down by the state’s High Court, which ruled it unconstitutional). Australian private equity firm Adamantem took a 33% stake in Evnex (and half its board seats) through its $350m Environmental Opportunities Fund (the price was undisclosed; earlier Harvey told the Herald he was looking for around $10m). That made it the largest single shareholder in Evnex ahead of Harvey, and earlier backers Movac and Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1 – who supported a $3m seed round in 2021 – which both hold small stakes. If Adamantem’s name sounds familiar, it’s the firm that last year had a tilt at The Warehouse Group. It has investments in a range of businesses in New Zealand and Australia, including the sausage and bacon business Hellers, where it took control for $213m in 2018. It also owns EdgeZero (low-voltage grid monitoring) and electrical products maker Legend Corp. Harvey says that in Australia, this is even more so the case, with drivers now getting paid to charge in the middle of the day due to too much solar energy being generated. Australia has much higher home solar uptake, making it more fertile ground for Evnex’s more expensive solar-supporting X series. The Lucky Country is being bombed with new Chinese brands as Biden-era US tariffs – now being expanded by Trump II – push stock Dowunder (a phenomenon we’re also seeing, to a slightly lesser degree, on this side of the ditch). And lastly and definitely not leastly: “Cost of living is still an issue in Australia, but the economy is doing comparatively better than New Zealand. People probably aren’t tightening their belts quite as much,” Harvey says. The National-led Government has pledged to expand the current public charger network to 10,000 points by 2030, although details are still fuzzy. Would Harvey like to see some of that funding go to smart home chargers? He keeps his answer broad strokes. “We’d like to see some more incentives for EVs in New Zealand. We think the current Government is under-doing it a bit,” Harvey says. He would also like to see regulatory changes for the likes of pre-wiring for chargers in new apartment blocks (retrofits can be very expensive) and to make it easier – or simply possible – for kerbside solutions for townhouse dwellers and others without garages. “The less oil we require, the more we end up supporting our own state-owned electricity generators,” Harvey adds. “So I think it will be really great to see the National Party consider a little bit more about their policy because we import roughly $3 billion worth of fuel a year. And the more electric vehicles we have, the less reliant we are on that.” Amazon Web Services New Zealand made a net profit of $23.3m on net sales that rose 11% to $425.7m for the 12 months to December 31, 2024, according to accounts filed with the Companies Office on Friday. In 2023, AWS NZ made a net loss of $2.8m on net sales of $384.6m. The firm – 100% owned by its US parent Amazon.com Inc – made a $4.9m provision for income tax for 2024 vs $1.8m in 2023. Cash and equivalents increased to $105.7m from $57.0m. Payroll costs fell to $7.1m from $7.4m in 2023. Amazon bought land for its supermassive new Auckland data centre – construction has just kicked off at Westgate – via a separate vehicle created for the project, AWS Data Services, which has yet to file public accounts. In revenue terms, AWS is easily the global market leader in cloud services. Earlier this month, Amazon said AWS’ global revenue increased 19% to $28.79 billion in the fourth quarter as it continued to ride the AI boom. “Virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it,” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said. The local operation’s results were also informed by changes in inhouse expenses, with costs incurred from related party transactions swinging in AWS NZ’s favour. AWS declined an interview over its financials, in keeping with the usual approach from its Big Tech peers. Notes with AWS’s accounts note that New Zealand passed legislation last year to support the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Specificiallly, BEPS’ “Pillar Two” - that is, a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. The legislation came into effect on January 1. The returning President Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle Pillar Two - and even signed an executive order asking Federal agencies to “explore” retaliatory measures. Regardless, tax experts told the Herald that New Zealand would get little-to-no extra revenue from Pillar Two, given any top-up tax paid to reach the 15% minimum will be paid in a Big Tech firm’s home country. Amazon has previewed a conversational AI, dubbed Alexa+, for its Echo line of smart displays and screens and Fire TV - which spans from Amazon’s own gadgets to a new alliance with Panasonic to power its latest smart TVs. Head of devices Panos Panay fired off commands with natural phrasing: “Alexa, what’s that song that Bradley Cooper sings and it’s like a duet?” A speaker began playing “Shallow.” He followed up with: “Alexa, can you jump to the scene in the movie?” A nearby Fire TV opened the film “A Star Is Born,” right to the climactic scene. New Alexa Routines infer what you mean without an explicit request, like adjusting the temperature on your smart thermostat when you say you’re cold, or dimming the lights when you say it’s too bright, Panay said. You could already chat with Alexa, but now it looks smoother and easier. Notably, Panay’s demos were all live. Amazon says the new features will work with its own services plus those from the likes of GrubHub, OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Whole Foods Market (the supermarket chain owned by Amazon), Uber, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max and smart home devices from companies like Philips Hue in the US - where Alexa+ will launch from March at US$19.99 per month, or free for subscribers to the US$14.99 per month Amazon Prime (which in the US is a more all-embracing service that includes deliveries). The no-extra cost touch will be appreciated by those annoyed by the approach taken by rivals (read: Tech Insider: Google follows Microsoft in raising prices as it bundles AI). Amazon plans to expand Alexa+ beyond the US but there’s no timeline at this point. The firm says it will supply more details on the local experience and pricing closer to its NZ launch. The launch was a bit delayed. Amazon was initially shaping up for an upgrade in late 2023, during the first wave of LLM hype around ChatGPT. But it still has breathing space. Apple has yet to add Apple Intelligence to its HomePods, while Google’s Gemini is still only available to a subset of its smart speaker users under a preview programme launched in December. The Elon Musk-driven Department of Government Efficiency has been lauded by some for employing a tech industry-style “move fast and break things” model. But according to a New York Times audit, its errors are piling up. DOGE has claimed US$65b in savings but has only itemised US$10b - and with that US10b there have been a number of gross exaggerations. In one case, DOGE listed a contract worth US$8 million as actually being worth US$8 billion. In another, it mistakenly counted the same US$655 million contract three times. In a third, it claimed it had saved $149 million by canceling a contract for three administrative assistants at the National Institutes of Health worth about $1.4 million. And then there’s a slew of contracts “cancelled” that actually expired years ago. For example, “While George W. Bush was president, the US Coast Guard signed a contract to get administrative help from a company in Northern Virginia. It paid $144,000, and the contract was completed by June 30, 2005,” the Times says. “Twenty years passed. Presidents came and went. “Last week, Elon Musk’s restructuring team, called the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, said it had just canceled the long-dead Coast Guard contract — and in doing so, saved U.S. taxpayers $53.7 million. There have been local examples, too. Wellington-based tech commentator Peter Griffin posted: “I got the following email from the US State Department over the weekend informing me that a grant a NZ charity I’m involved in was given by the State Department is being terminated.” Griffin added, “But the grant ended years ago and the money is already spent. I’d say a lot of cancelled programmes and funding is actually tidying up an out-of-date database. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

Select a question above or ask something else The travel tech industry has seen at least 17 acquisitions so far in 2025, predominantly driven by smaller deals. Private equity firms, with substantial funds to deploy, are leading a surge in acquisitions, particularly in modernizing payment systems. Notable transactions include Shift4's acquisition of Global Blue for $2.5 billion and Flywire's purchase of Sertifi for $330 million, highlighting a significant focus on enhancing payment technologies within the travel sector. Small deals are leading unprecedented M&A activity in travel tech right now, and you'll see that they dominate the list below. As we recently reported, private equity firms have accumulated an estimated $3 trillion that they need to deploy, and roughly $300 billion of that is earmarked for tech. Investment bank AGC Partners says these PE-backed players are going on a “feeding frenzy” to acquire smaller companies and consolidate their respective markets. One area where larger deals are emerging is in travel payments. There have been two such deals in payment tech in recent weeks: Shift4 plans to purchase Global Blue for $2.5 billion, and Flywire just bought Sertifi for $330 million. Paired with two other big deals in the past couple of years, there seems to be a pattern emerging. Amadeus last year acquired Voxel for $123.2 million. And Sabre acquired Conferma Pay in 2022 for $72.5 million. All of these companies are trying to get ahead of a big shift in travel toward modern payment systems, as the industry races to catch up with retail. A survey by Amadeus in 2023 found that ease of payment is the top tech issue for travelers over the next 10 years. Overall, there have been at least 17 acquisitions in travel tech announced since the start of 2025. Here is the breakdown. Shift4, a payments and ecommerce tech company, plans to acquire Global Blue for $2.5 billion. Shift4 provides payments tech to industries including airlines, hotels, food and beverage, and more. Global Blue specializes in tax-free shopping and payment tech, connecting retail and hospitality businesses with international travelers. Shoppers can claim value-added tax (VAT) refunds through the Global Blue platform, and the tech enables them to pay for goods in their own currency. The company’s tech is used in more than 400,000 retail and hospitality locations. (Travelers can get VAT refunds on certain goods — like clothing, accessories, electronics — in the European Union, the UK, and multiple countries in Asia and other regions.) Shift4 says that the deal opens up an entirely new market for the company. Global Blue’s merchant solutions will be added to Shift4’s global payments platform to deliver an enhanced end-to-end experience for its merchants. Shift4 plans to acquire Global Blue for $7.50 per common share in cash. Global Blue will no longer be listed on any public stock exchange following the transaction, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2025. Flywire, which provides cross-border payments tech for travel companies, has acquired Sertifi for $330 million in a bid to expand services for hotels. Flywire's platform is meant to help travel companies simplify and streamline payments from consumers. Most clients are tour operators, destination management companies, and hotels. The company has about 4,500 clients globally across all the industries it serves, including education and health care. The platform by Chicago-based Sertifi is meant to help hotels streamline events contracting, group bookings, and their associated payments. The company has 20,000 hotel clients, including brands under Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, as well as luxury independent hotels like Sage Hospitality Group and the Corinthia Hotel in London. Sertifi was founded in 2008. (See Skift’s story.) HomeToGo, an online marketplace for vacation rentals, said in February that it plans to acquire Interhome for up to $260 million (€250 million). The purchase price includes $166.5 million (€160 million) upfront and up to $93.6 million (€90 million) in deferred payments for up to four years. Interhome (Germany) is an online marketplace for vacation rentals owned by the Hotelplan Group, which is part of the Migros Corporation. TravelPerk, the corporate travel platform, acquired the expense management startup Yokoy. TravelPerk plans to integrate Yokoy’s tech to become an all-in-one corporate travel and expense platform. TravelPerk recently raised $200 million for the transition and international growth. (See Skift’s story.) Mews, the hotel tech startup, recently bought its 12th company. The company bought New Zealand-based Clarity Hospitality Software Solutions, which provides property and event management systems for hundreds of hotels groups, event venues and independent hotels in the APAC region and the UK. Landfolk, a vacation rental platform founded by former Airbnb employees, acquired Danitalia.com to expand into Italy. Denmark-based Landfolk says it helps owners rent their vacation homes during the majority of the year when they normally would sit empty. The startup had more than 3,000 homes in its portfolio in Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Sweden. The acquisition gives it more than 130 homes in Italy. Landfolk raised $11.2 million in 2024. Real estate tech provider Yardi acquired Deskpass and Hubble, both apps that remote workers can use to book coworking spaces. Deskpass, based in Chicago, says it lists more than 7,900 coworking and shared office spaces in 260 cities. London-based Hubble says it lists thousands of spaces in the UK and beyond. Yardi already operates CoworkingCafe, a marketplace for coworking spaces with more than 21,000 locations. It also operates Yardi Kube, which provides back-office tech for coworking offices. Sabre sold its business-travel booking tool, GetThere, to Serko for $12 million. Serko is a corporate travel management company based in New Zealand. Sabre bought GetThere in August 2000 for $757 million. Along with the purchase, Sabre and Serko began a long-term partnership to invest and grow the GetThere business. Sabre detailed that partnership in October. Serko said last week that it is investing $100 million over the next three years for tech that will power all of its products, including GetThere, Zeno, and Booking.com for Business. Moove, the Uber-backed company that provides financing to help rideshare drivers purchase cars, is expanding into Brazil and Latin America with the acquisition of Kovi. Brazil-based Kovi has car rental and rent-to-own services, as well as a car rental program for rideshare drivers. Moove says the deal increases its global fleet to 36,000 vehicles in 19 cities. It also increases annual recurring revenue to upwards of $275 million, the company said, up from $115 million that it reported in 2024. Moove plans to purchase at least 15,000 vehicles annually as part of its long-term strategy. The company says drivers have completed more than 50 million trips completed in financed vehicles through its Uber partnership. Juniper Group has acquired InteRES, which provides distribution and retail tech for the airline industry. The InteRES owner, who founded the company in 1997, sold his shares along with minority owner TUI Deutschland. Juniper Group is an operating portfolio of Vela Software, one of the six divisions of Toronto-based Constellation Software. Juniper Group owns more than 30 companies, including around a dozen in travel. The company plans to buy as many as a dozen travel tech companies this year, said Jaime Sastre, CEO of Juniper Group, in an interview with Skift in January. Private equity firm Creador acquired a controlling stake in MG Group, which connects over 8,000 global buyers with more than 350,000 accommodation suppliers. The move positions Indonesia-based MG Group for global expansion. (See Skift’s story.)
