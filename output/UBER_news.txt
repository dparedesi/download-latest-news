Throughout 2025, via political donations and not-so-subtle business moves, DoorDash has been showing the millions of gig workers who make its multibillion-dollar business viable that it’s willing to spend far more to undermine their rights than to compensate them fairly—and it may soon replace them entirely with driverless vehicles. Last week, the United States’ largest food-delivery platform announced it was kickstarting a partnership with the autonomous vehicle brand Waymo—a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, that’s come closer than any other Silicon Valley firm to realizing the longtime tech dream of the safe self-driving automobile. Phoenix, one of the five cities where Waymo actually operates, will be the urban laboratory for home deliveries of food, groceries, and other goods from participating retailers via driverless car. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, two of the other metropolises that have welcomed Waymo, subscribers to the $10-a-month DashPass can earn a $10 discount off one Waymo ride every month. L.A. shoppers can also get “last-10-feet” front-yard service thanks to DoorDash’s new alliance with Serve Robotics, best known as the startup behind all those boxy, four-wheeled delivery bots that have appeared on John Mulaney’s talk show, collided with disabled Californians, and been attacked by displeased hooligans for TikTok #content. Our riders trust @Waymo to travel safely. Partnering with @DoorDash expands that trust, offering another way for customers to make Waymo part of their daily routines. https://t.co/DjNT6MgPiH DoorDash is wasting no time bringing more of its customers up close to a self-propelled, tip-free delivery economy—and reconfiguring the system so more money ends up in their corporate coffers than in any human clients’ pockets. (It’s not for nothing that the Waymo-Phoenix experiment will initially service DoorDash’s own store, DashMart, and its self-branded network of inventory houses.) Earlier this month, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT will soon integrate DoorDash’s digital functions within the generative-text bot itself, allowing users to place orders without having to abandon their virtual partner for even a minute. Late last month, DoorDash rolled out its own delivery-robot model, Dot, in the streets of metro Phoenix as a test for a “hybrid” structure: Human “Dashers” cart orders over the long haul, then hand those wares to Dot so it can wheel up to your front porch, its heart-eyes aglow. That’s all on top of DoorDash’s springtime expansion of a sidewalk-robot delivery fleet manufactured by Coco Robotics, its summertime plans to invest further into A.I.-powered ad tech, and its barely year-old drone delivery program in the Dallas–Fort Worth region. The straightforward conclusion is that DoorDash and its investors are ready to automate every function of this newly profitable, still-independent tech juggernaut that’s grown large enough to swallow up international platforms like the British delivery outfit Deliveroo—even if the side effect is A.I.-generated food images. (The publicly traded company’s stock value has grown by nearly 60 percent throughout the year.) But to understand why the strategy is to get to wholesale human replacement instead of merely supplementing Dasher labor, look to the other realm where DoorDash has been speaking with its profits. There’s been no shortage of national chatter around New York City’s mayoral race. But even before the pro-labor, anti-gig-economy Zohran Mamdani leapt to broader fame, DoorDash had helped push election expenditures in the city’s primaries to record levels, in order to stop him and other like-minded politicos. First, in May, the company donated $1 million to Fix the City, a political action committee formed to support former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s political return. Committing a $5 million chest to NYC’s Democratic Party primaries and forming its own super PAC (called Local Economies Forward), DoorDash also shoveled cash into various City Council races and tried to boost the council speaker’s laggard challenge to Cuomo and Mamdani. All the while, it’s deployed a beefed-up lobbying army to City Hall in opposition to the labor rights won on behalf of New York’s deliverers, rideshare drivers, and other gig workers—as well as the added protections and guarantees being considered for passage. (Right now, DoorDash and other tech-economy giants like Uber are yelping at the Council over a pending bill that demands a just-cause process before locking a worker out of their account; after Seattle passed a similar bill in July, DoorDash geofenced a “Seattle fee” surcharge that bled out into the surrounding towns.) The years since the pandemic fueled a major political shift in the perception of gig workers, especially those in large cities like New York. While tens of thousands delivery workers (many of them immigrants) kept working outside amid a public health shutdown and got hailed as essential workers, the NYC Council became more attuned to these deliverers’ concerns, whether they worked for DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart, or some other booming gig market. (Delivery robots also gained more attention around this time, though they were hardly up to the task.) Through a series of high-profile protests and rallies, deliverers informed customers that they were getting stiffed on pay, and they did not have durable insurance to cover accidents, robberies, injuries, and physical attacks. From 2021 onward, New York lawmakers began passing bills that required gig-delivery apps to stop hitting their drivers with surprise fees and make their tipping policies more transparent, while mandating third-party client restaurants to allow these workers bathroom access. In 2023, the City Council set a new, higher minimum wage for restaurant delivery workers, the first of its kind in the entire country; because the law left out grocery-delivery apps in a misstep that became known as the “Instacart loophole,” council members have now been working to extend that basic compensation to those left out of the first round. (It didn’t hurt the cause that Instacart executives were caught on tape explicitly bragging about hoarding profits by “squeezing” deliverers, usually by “batching” separate orders in bulk in order to tamp down compensation opportunities.) So, as these protections took effect in New York and spread to other areas like Seattle and Massachusetts, the likes of Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart attempted to strike back by forming and funding new lobbying groups and PACs, which produced ads that made it seem like not giving their workers basic rights would preserve their “flexibility,” benefiting them and their local economies. Having successfully denied deliverers employee-level benefits in California by promoting a 2020 “independent contractor” ballot initiative, these gig apps have been replicating the approach elsewhere, to much less success. (New York City Mayor Eric Adams vetoed a recent spate of gig-work legislation that was publicly opposed by DoorDash, but the council overrode him.) Most stinging of all for DoorDash is that, even outside of the laws, they’ve had to spend more on their New York workers. In February, it settled a tip-theft lawsuit from New York state Attorney General Letitia James (incidentally, the woman who investigated Cuomo out of the governor’s mansion) by compensating Dashers a cumulative $17 million. Last year, DoorDash had to settle another case from James that alleged discrimination against deliverer applicants with criminal histories, forcing the company to review bids from thousands of rejected wannabe-Dashers and to pay them a total of $75,000. These settlements were not very remunerative for the people affected by DoorDash’s practices; the 2024 agreement paid out just an average of $25 per rejected applicant. But the message from DoorDash’s spirited lobbying is that even these tiny sums are too costly as expenses for human capital. (Its partnership with the Swedish buy-now-pay-later platform Klarna makes for even worse optics, considering the latter’s CEO has frequently boasted about slashing thousands of positions thanks to A.I.) The platform doesn’t appear to be too concerned with how much its Dashers earn, and when. So when your lobbying efforts fail and you have to give your workers more thanks to new laws and court settlements, what do you try next? You tighten the squeeze, mostly by adding all sorts of extra fees for consumers, under the specious claim that it’s actually going to drivers. Despite the messaging that better pay for workers makes everything more expensive, fewer people are falling for the talking point. Members of Congress have probed DoorDash over alleged “junk fees” and price gouging, and disaffected customers have filed Federal Trade Commission complaints along with class-action suits. In Illinois, one state lawmaker has proposed a regionwide “tax” on DoorDash and Uber deliveries that would help fund a beleaguered public transit system. So it’s little wonder that DoorDash, at a moment when its anti-worker crusades have had little return, is looking to autonomous vehicles, whether those are slick self-driving cars or meme-ready boxy cartons, in order to ramp up the human squeeze. It’s just following in the vein of fellow tech giants like Amazon, which is hoping to discard all the union drives and complaints from warehouse staffers, gig drivers, and fulfillment-center franchisees by automating up to 75 percent of its operations, according to internal documents obtained by the New York Times. That may not go as well as DoorDash may think, however. Despite Waymo’s undeniable success, it’s also facing a Trump administration probe over the failure of its cars to safely and properly handle the presence of the school buses with which it shares the road; reluctance from other big cities to fully embrace Waymo and Serve Robotics just yet; and the so far persistent costliness of human-free Waymo vehicles compared with long-standing rideshare companies, which have also become more expensive in recent years. (There’s also the issue of what happens when a Waymo car collides with a Saymo bot in a city that’s taken in both.) DoorDash hopes that bots won’t ask for the rights and wages now afforded to many urban delivery workers, but it may not be able to beat the simple human urge for real-life connection, even if it’s mediated through an app. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now. Market musings It's 2019. You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me. A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?" I'll have to save up first, I told him. Do you own a pair of Zegnas or another quiet luxury item you love?

Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.” OK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. Speaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter.

Title: The AI revolution's next casualty could be the gig economy

Every time Steve publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents.
