Performance Review of Q3 & YTD FY25 * Strong Q3 performance with Revenue growth of 9.7% QoQ and 15.3% YoY and * Adjusted EBITDA at 31.4% with 35.2% growth QoQ and 67.3% YoY and * Adjusted PAT at 18.1% with 60.5% growth QoQ and 67.6% YoY Read more “We expect a reduction in the repo rate in the April MPC meeting taking into account the moderation in GDP growth and inflation coming down. We expect a shallow rate cutting cycle of 50-75 bps over the next 9 months.” by Puneet Pal, Head-Fixed Income, PGIM India Mutual Fund. Domestic markets are expected to open strongly higher, thanks to global cues and the unwinding of short positions of foreign portfolio investors in the F&O segment. Better-than-expected results by US-listed Cognizant Technologies are likely to lift sentiment for IT stocks, said analysts. Exit polls suggesting an advantage to the BJP in the New Delhi assembly elections will also boost traders’ sentiment. Read more While a conventional 25bps rate cut in the upcoming MPC policy is less of a market debate, the actions around ‘what beyond a cut’ will be more watched. Easing by stealth via unconventional policy tools like liquidity and regulatory measures will continue. The RBI may also want to address the stress in the non-sovereign money market. We expect another round of ~Rs300bn OMOs, implying Rs900 bn+ in total in FY25E. A CRR cut is a close call, but a temporary cut may not address the underlying banking stress. Easing in ensuing tighter LCR norms (Apr-25 onwards) and lending standards might be a preferred policy tool. We will also watch for additional capital account easing actions via the FCNR route. Key Highlights: · Fiscal Prudence Maintained: The FY25 fiscal deficit is projected at 4.8%, with a target to reduce it to 4.4% in FY26. · Shift from Capex to Consumption: A ₹1 trillion consumption boost (30bps of GDP) through income tax cuts has been introduced, reducing the capex growth forecast to 9% CAGR (FY24-26) from 30% CAGR (FY14-20). · Sector Impact: Ø Positive Impact: Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), small-ticket discretionary spending (beauty, autos, consumer durables), and ITC (no cigarette tax increase). Summary: India Macro – Budget 2025: Shift from Capex to Consumption Macquarie Equity Research | February 2025 Key Highlights: Fiscal Prudence Maintained: The FY25 fiscal deficit is projected at 4.8%, with a target to reduce it to 4.4% in FY26. Shift from Capex to Consumption: A ₹1 trillion consumption boost (30bps of GDP) through income tax cuts has been introduced, reducing the capex growth forecast to 9% CAGR (FY24-26) from 30% CAGR (FY14-20). Sector Impact: Positive Impact: Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), small-ticket discretionary spending (beauty, autos, consumer durables), and ITC (no cigarette tax increase). Negative Impact: Industrials and infrastructure sentiment is weaker in the near term. Consumption Boost: · The tax rate reduction benefits 10 million people earning ₹0.7-1.2 million per year. · Private sector wage growth has lagged inflation, making tax cuts a short-term booster. Policy Outlook & Economic Growth: · Nominal GDP growth is assumed at ~10.1%, and tax buoyancy at 1.1x is considered reasonable. · The government plans structural reforms to sustain long-term growth and achieve its Viksit Bharat (Developed Nation) vision. Key Sector Implications: · Insurance: Increase in FDI cap to 100%, benefiting life insurers. · Auto: Higher disposable income will boost auto demand, benefiting TVS, Bajaj, MSIL, Hyundai, M&M. · Consumer Durables: Growth in Havells, Voltas, driven by consumption spending. · Infrastructure: Housing, power, and defense capex increased; roads and railways flat. · New Age/Consumer Stocks: Zomato, Swiggy, D-Mart to benefit from increased discretionary spending. · Industrials: Short-term negative sentiment due to lower capex allocations. MSMEs across manufacturing, trading and services (other than trading) sectors noted an uptick in their business performance in the period October-December 2024. Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has launched their first ever MSME Outlook Survey a quarterly analysis of MSME business sentiment for the October-December 2024 period. The report, based on a pan-India survey of 1,200 MSMEs across Manufacturing, Services, and Trading sectors, captures business sentiment on 22 critical parameters, including sales growth, profitability, employment trends, financial access, cost of funds, and ease of doing business. The survey covered 77 cities (Tier 1, 2, and 3) and 66 villages across India, ensuring a diverse representation of MSME voices. Key findings indicate strong business confidence among MSMEs, particularly in the manufacturing sector reflecting optimism in sales, profitability, skilled labor availability, and access to finance for the coming quarters. Additionally, the report highlights a steady rise in digital adoption and sustainability measures across MSMEs. Shri Manoj Mittal, Chairman and Managing Director, SIDBI while releasing the report said, “MSMEs serve as the crucial foundation of the Indian economy and a powerful instrument for bringing about socioeconomic change. SIDBI has always acknowledged the incredible contribution of MSMEs in India’s growth story and is committed to the development of the sector through both financial and non-financial initiatives. The importance given to this sector by GOI is also evident from the fact that it has been identified as one of the four growth engines of the economy during the recent union budget. I firmly believe that the continuous flow of quality information on MSMEs through this survey will help all stakeholders in evaluating the current business climate and fine-tune their respective approaches. The survey also highlights: A rising commitment to sustainability, with 39% of MSMEs increasing investments in environmental protection measures such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and new technology during the quarter, and 44% planning to expand such investments in the next year. Additionally, 73% of participants found trade receivable timelines acceptable, with 14% noting an improvement from the previous quarter and 38% expecting further enhancements a year ahead. Sales growth expectations remain robust, with 43% anticipating expansion next quarter and 45% over the next year, while export optimism has surged from 22% for Oct-Dec 2024 to 36% for Oct-Dec 2025.

Meanwhile, first-time and newer advertisers are courting outrageousness and using stunts to try to stand out in the battle to capture the attention of the more than 120 million viewers expected to tune into Sunday’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on Fox.Super Bowl viewers are a unique audience because they’re as primed to watch the ads as they are the game.“This is a societal moment where we come together as a country,” said Kimberly Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. “We may be on different sides, you know, of the gridiron or the field. But we come together.”With 80-plus ad spots divvied up among the 50-something advertisers during the game, it’s tough to make sure viewers remember your brand message. And with a few ad spots going for a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year, the stakes have never been higher.But the price tag is worth it, advertisers say. Rachel Jaiven, head of Häagen-Dazs marketing, said the brand decided to make its first-ever appearance in the game due to the size of the viewership and its association with snacking. “We know at the Super Bowl these days that everyone watches, it’s a wide audience,” Jaiven said. The brand’s ad shows stars from the “Fast & Furious” franchise enjoying an ice cream bar. “We thought it was time for us to tell our story, remind people what they love about Häagen-Dazs and of course, have them stock up on Häagen-Dazs in their freezer.”In order to garner more publicity, many advertisers release their ads ahead of the game. Of the ads that have already been released, here’s a sampling of the approaches advertisers are taking during the big game this year.CELEBRITY-PALOOZAHellmann’sHellmann’s ad made a splash ahead of the game by reuniting Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s “When Harry Met Sally” characters at Katz’s Deli enjoying a sandwich with Hellmann’s.

Eugene Levy’s trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars NEW YORK -- Eugene Levy's trademark eyebrows fly off for Little Caesars. A tongue dances to Shania Twain to promote Nestle's Coffee Mate Cold Foam. And Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reunite at Katz's Deli in an ad for Hellmann's. A frenzied mix of silliness and celebrities is hitting the airwaves and the internet, and that means one thing: it is Super Bowl ad time again. Veteran advertisers are using tried-and-true tactics like celebrity cameos, humor and cute animals to win over watchers.

Instacart First-timer Instacart joins DoorDash and Uber Eats and a battle between food delivery services during the game. Instacart loads up its ad with tons of brand characters it hopes viewers recognize: from Mountain Dew’s “PuppyMonkeyBaby” character from a 2016 Super Bowl ad to the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The characters represent all the things you can get delivered from the food delivery service. Totinos Pizza Rolls In one of several ads featuring aliens, comedian Tim Robinson and actor Sam Richardson say goodbye to an alien who was living in their neighborhood. Cookware brand Hexclad and Doritos ads also feature aliens. Not all advertisers release their ads early, so there are always plenty of surprises on game day. Only two auto brands, Stellantis' Jeep and Ram, have announced Super Bowl ad plans, but they haven't given any details on the ads. Dunkin' has secured the first ad spot after kickoff but is staying mum on details other than teasing that it will star Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong. Canned water company Liquid Death will advertise for the first time with an ad created in-house. Duracell has teased that its ad will feature a “Duracell Scientist” but hasn't given any other details. Ad experts think it is unlikely that an A.I.-generated ad will debut during advertising's biggest night after Coca-Cola's holiday ad created with the help of A.I. technology drew some backlash. But if one did debut, it would be sure to make a splash. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Google Leads Tech Stock Slump As Earnings, Trump Tariffs Fallout Weighs On Market

A slew of major American technology stocks pulled back Wednesday, as the latest batch of fourth-quarter earnings and an increasingly complicated operating environment for multinational companies ate at Wall Street’s risk appetite. An ever-shifting geopolitical backdrop has weighed on the minds of investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipped 0.7% shortly after market open. Leading the losses was an 8% drop for Google parent Alphabet, a slide which erased as much as $211 billion in market value after the company’s earnings report revealed weaker Q4 revenues than consensus analyst forecasts and far higher 2025 spending guidance than anticipated, as Alphabet stock paces toward its biggest percentage loss since October 2023. Also struggling after their company’s earnings reports were shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices and ride-hailer Uber. AMD stock tanked 10% to their cheapest level since 2023 after the firm fell short of estimates in its artificial intelligence-focused datacenter division, while Uber stock fell 7% after the company predicted lower-than-expected ride revenue during 2025’s first three months. Notable fallers not tied to quarterly results included iPhone maker Apple, and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle producer Tesla, both of which suffered about 2% share price declines. Apple’s drop followed a Bloomberg report Chinese regulators are considering an antitrust investigation into Apple over its App Store fees, a possible retaliation to President Donald Trump’s 10% additional tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. Tesla’s dip came after the company reportedly suffered its worst month for new car sales in Germany since 2021 and France since 2022, a potential consequence of Musk’s outspoken support for right-wing politicians including Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland party. The Nasdaq is still up 1% in 2025, but it’s been a rocky path to those gains, as tariffs and the heated U.S.-China generative AI competition weighed on investors’ minds. Also down Wednesday were New York-listed shares of Chinese companies. Online retailers Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo, the two most valuable U.S.-traded Chinese firms, both suffered about 2% drops as investors reacted to an increasingly messy trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which most recently resulted in the U.S. Postal Service briefly pausing acceptance of all packages from China and Hong Kong.

Sheaffer Told Me To fashion influencer blog February 5, 2025 By Sheaffer 2 Comments This post is sponsored by Nordstrom and Collective Voice. The product selections are my own, and I only highlight and promote items that I truly love. Thank you for supporting the brands that support Sheaffer Told Me To! ***************** It’s February, which means before we know it, we will be transitioning to spring. Heck, if you live where I live, we basically transitioned to summer this past Monday because we got up to almost 80 degrees. But no worries, today is in the 50s and we’ll be back to winter and temps in the 20s by next weekend, which means I’m already in transitional dressing mode. Haha! I hear from y’all all the time that transitional dressing often stumps people, but I always follow some simple tips and tricks that help me easily transition between seasons. We’ll be talking about them over the next several weeks, but today we’re focusing on pants that really lend themselves to transitional dressing. Tell me this isn’t a perfect outfit to help you transition to warmer temps. (FYI, I was actually hot in this outfit when we were taking pics on Monday.) white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers One of my main tips to transition to another season is a no brainer: to dress in layers. Every single outfit in today’s post starts with this classic white tee that is the perfect base layer. If you’ve been with me for a while, you know I used to wear the “whisper thin” Madewell v-neck tee all the time. It was a good tee at a good price point, but it wasn’t the best quality because it was pretty thin. This white tee is my new favorite white tee. It’s made of a 100% cotton jersey, the fit is perfect, and it’s not see-through at all. Heads up that is does run small. I’m in a medium, and the fit is actually great for a base layering piece, but I would probably want it a bit looser if I was wearing it on its own. And speaking of layers, a great denim jacket is THE #1 CLOSET STAPLE that I feel every single person needs in their closet. I think Kut from the Kloth makes the greatest denim jackets, and you can click HERE to find the one with the wash and fit that you prefer. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers sunglasses / earrings / heart charm necklace heart charm necklace layered coil bracelet / textured bangle I found these ecru jeans last year, but they sold out immediately. They restocked, and then they sold out again. BUT RIGHT NOW THEY APPEAR TO BE FULLY STOCKED and they are a perfect transitional pair of pants. This particular pair is a perfectly neutral “ecru”, but they come in 3 other color options as well. They are ankle cropped flares with a frayed hem, and I love them so much. They do have the Ab Solution power mesh panels that we all appreciate, and they enable the jeans to be super flattering and super comfy at the same time. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Y’all. These sneakers. Talk about a breath of fresh air! I’m wearing the “Clear Pink/ Solar Orange/ Gum”, but there’s actually 14 fantastic color combos to choose from! They are incredibly comfy, but I definitely recommend sizing down at least 1/2 a size. white tee / denim jacket options / ecru jeans / Adidas sneakers Dang they’re cute. Adidas sneakers Adidas sneakers Here I’ve switched up the top layer from a denim jacket to a cardigan. And I switched out sneakers for mules. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules This striped cardigan comes in 3 colors and got marked down just yesterday! It’s 100% cotton and a heavier weight than most of the other cardigans in my closet. I’m often drawn to olive green, and y’all know I loved the stripes. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. The cross body is a new favorite find. It’s on the expensive side, but it’s definitely a quality handbag and I think many of y’all are going to think that it is well worth it. The neutral basket weave pattern will go with pretty much any outfit you can dream up, and it comes with a removable shoulder strap as well as a removable cross body strap. There are two interior pockets that make it easy to store your phone or keys…AND GET THIS… you can throw the bag in the wash. No kidding. I’m carrying the “knot brown”, but there’s also a darker option called “Hazelnut”. You can check out all of the bag options from Rothy’s HERE. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules And these earrings? Come on! They’re darling. white tee / striped cardigan / earrings / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / striped cardigan / ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag These Rothy’s mules are something special. I really wanted this neutral pair, but they also come in black and an animal print. If I’m being honest, I wish owning all 3 pair made sense because I know I would wear the heck out of all of them. True to size, super super comfy, and they don’t flop when you walk! ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules They are beautifully made, and I absolutely love the design detail. ecru jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Before we talk about these pants, I’m sad to report that y’all sold them out on Monday. 🙁 I’d already shot these pics and had the idea for the post, so I’m still highlighting the pants…. but I’m doing so with the knowledge that my contact says they are slated to come back in stock at some point, they just don’t know when. When they do come back, GRAB THEM. You pull these babies on like you would a pair of your favorite leggings. But I’m telling you, they’re more comfortable than leggings, because they don’t have the compression that most leggings have. The waistband is wide, it lays nicely, and it is of course uber comfy. And get excited, because as you can see, there are functional pockets. When compared to the other black Wit and Wisdom pants I’ve highlighted in the past, these are a lighter weight than all of them. They have a slimmer leg than the drawstring pants, but the leg is a bit fuller and longer than the more classic trousers I’ve highlighted. For size reference, I’m wearing a small. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers I think this is the way I’ll wear them the most. With a casual tee and a denim jacket. This is an outfit formula that ALWAYS works. This look would also be great with a leopard tote and neutral mules…. or a black bag and white sneakers… the possibilities are endless. If you love the look and want to recreate it, you can click HERE for a similar pair of pants that I also own and love. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers And surprise surprise… a great white tee and a great denim jacket completing another outfit. 😉 white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers sunglasses / earrings / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace How fun is this necklace combo? This puffy heart is VERY oversized, and I love it. My exact beaded necklace is low in stock, but you can click HERE for a similar option from the same maker if the exact one is no longer available. white tee / puffy heart necklace / multicolor bead necklace These pants are so SO good. Truly, these pants are what black pant dreams are made of. They are a wider leg (but not too wide), which makes them modern but still flattering and not overwhelming. I’m 5’4″ with long legs for my height, and although I think a non-heeled shoe is probably the best choice for these on me, you can click HERE to see Monday’s post where I do have a pic of me wearing them with low black pumps. Again, you can click HERE for a similar pair. white tee / denim jacket options / black pants / leopard sneakers Here’s a good up-close look at the pants. layered coil bracelet / textured bangle / white tee / denim jacket options / black pants I’m so pumped that I grabbed these leopard sneakers, and I’m so excited to add some sass and comfort to lots of different outfits. They are the perfect pop of leopard to add if you ask me! True to size and quite comfy. Like really REALLY comfy. black pants / leopard sneakers I’m in love with this entire outfit. white tee / denim jacket options / earrings / leopard sneakers Here I’ve got the same pair of pants, but I’ve again switched out the denim jacket for a cardi and the sneakers for mules. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules This cardigan is another NEW MARKDOWN (as of just yesterday). I feel like it’s a totally classic piece that would serve anybody well. Pair it with black pants for the office, or pair it with jeans and sneakers for a great casual (but totally put together) outfit. This one has a really pretty cable knit pattern and a bit of an unexpected collar. I’m wearing a medium here, but I think I would actually prefer the fit of the small. It does have a tiny bit of wool in it, but it’s not scratchy at all! It’s just soft and warm. Also, I’m in love with the leopard tote from Rothy’s, but I’m so sad to report it’s not currently available at Nordstrom. Because of this, I’m not going to gush about it, but if it comes back in stock (fingers crossed), I totally will. You can click HERE for other leopard bag options if you just can’t wait. white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / cream cardigan / black pants / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules cream cardigan / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** Pants don’t always have to be serious. These army green flared ankle jeans aren’t serious, but they sure are unique and adorable. 😉 They’re also stretchy, comfy, and flattering. WIN! WIN! WIN! They come in stone, maple, moss, teal, strawberry, and petal… so there’s definitely something for everybody. I’m wearing my regular size 4. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And looky here, I’m wearing my white tee and denim jacket with these too. I’m telling you, if you don’t have a white tee and a denim jacket that you love, you need to fix that now. white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag L.O.V.E. denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s crossbody bag / leopard sneakers And here’s the same outfit, but with the leopard tote and neutral mules… white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules white tee / denim jacket options / army green flared ankle jeans / Rothy’s leopard tote / Rothy’s neutral mules ********** So what do you think? Can you see yourself in any of these pants? What about the white tee? And how fun are the bags and shoes? I hope you were able to draw some inspiration today for some outfits.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow futures slide as Alphabet and AMD earnings fall short

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains. That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates. On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point" "While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case." Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street. Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, "For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results." Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted pre-market, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft and margin commentary was mixed. January sales off to a slow start, too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance. Toyota Motor (TM)raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong. Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets. The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy. Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US. The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1% What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers. The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points. Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon. Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024. AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%. Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe. President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a "Riviera of the Middle East" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders. Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance "presumes headwinds related to market factors," such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports "would have a major impact on our industry." Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday. interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy. The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is "the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company." Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain. Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years. Read the full story here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, "I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance." San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, "We don’t need to be preemptive." Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that "you want to wait and see." Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand. "If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs," Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit. "That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act." Read more here. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024. Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle. The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending. Read the full story here. Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented. In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers. Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown. This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week. “Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients. To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers. After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%. On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%. Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data. The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction. "While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs," Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day. Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals. This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown. The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is "a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures." To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday. Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion. Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China. Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies. Read more here. US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday. I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest: European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere. The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses. Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat. Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments. Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another "modest decline" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1. Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results. Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago. For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year. Read more of Disney's earnings results here. Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog. The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell. Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times. The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks. Economic data: MBA mortgage applications (week ending Jan. 31); ADP Private Payrolls (December); S&P Global US services PMI (January final); S&P Global US composite PMI (January final); ISM services index (January final) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Alphabet's slumping cloud sales spook investors Morgan Stanley lowers Fed rate-cut forecast amid Trump tariffs AMD shares sink as AI fears eclipse Q4 earnings beat Trump's tariffs fail to derail Wall Street's bullish outlook USPS suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong Tech investors are aggressively buying the dip Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius came out this morning with his latest call on tariffs. Notably, he expects 10% China tariffs to be just the starting point. Stay on top of the latest updates on tariff threats and policy here. Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter. Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout. But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street. Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning: Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%. The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too. "We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point," Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning. O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today. I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview. Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs. The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen. In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units. Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

Title: What the EV Industry’s Challenges Reveal About Innovation and Regulation
URL: https://hbr.org/podcast/2025/02/what-the-ev-industrys-challenges-reveal-about-innovation-and-regulation
Time Published: 2025-02-04T13:00:44Z
Full Content:
A conversation with WSJ journalist Mike Colias on disruption and competition. Many consumers are buying electric vehicles, thanks to sportscar-like performance, government incentives, and personal motivations to minimize climate change. But the EV industry overall has revved and sputtered in unpredictable ways and offers a case study in managing innovation, regulation, and competition. Mike Colias, deputy bureau chief at The Wall Street Journal, explains the complex landscape that incumbents such as GM and Ford and start-ups like Tesla find themselves in. Through stories of iconic industry executives and bold competitive moves, he shares insights that leaders in every industry can learn from. Colias wrote the new book Inevitable: Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch. Innovation often happens slowly and then all at once. That’s the felt reality of disruptive innovation. Basically, if a big company doesn’t watch out, a startup can come in with a new inferior offering. Ignored long enough that upstart can improve its product and eventually, seemingly suddenly put the incumbent out of business. That phenomenon is well understood now. What’s hard is getting the timing right. You move too quickly to the new tech and customers aren’t there yet, you’re out of luck. Wait too long, someone else eats your lunch. Even when established companies recognize disruptive innovations and deliberately bring them on, it’s a complex balancing act to transition the business for the future. Case in point, actually cases in point, electric vehicles. The car industry is bursting with disruptive innovation case studies in the making. You’ll find many of them to learn from in the new book, Inevitable, Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles. The author is Mike Colias, Deputy Bureau Chief at the Wall Street Journal, and he joins us now. Hi, Mike. MIKE COLIAS: Hi, Curt. Thanks for having me on. CURT NICKISCH: It’s such a fascinating industry, of legacy companies, amazing brands, this consumer technology that we all totally get and are totally familiar with. A lot of emotion and economics involved. Then you’ve got electric vehicle technology, you’ve got driverless automation technology. It’s just a really amazing business. I think maybe we should set the scene here. Why do customers buy electric vehicles? What do companies know that they’re looking for? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, we’ve seen this evolution playing out now for about 15 years. It was 2010 is when GM came out with this Chevrolet Volt. It was actually a plugin hybrid. Nissan had the Leaf. That was a full EV and they came out about the same time and it was a big deal. It was a breakthrough. What you saw, I think, from 2010 to early this decade was a lot of people bought it for certainly environmental reasons. You had a lot of people who were interested in the technology, who wanted to just have the latest thing, who wanted to have the first EV in the neighborhood, those early adopters. As we’ve gotten to recent years and you’ve seen more and more models coming out – we can talk about why the industry has tried to pivot so hard toward EVs – more and more people are interested in them. I mean, surveys show that of the average car buyer, roughly half of them are at least open to the idea of electrics, but it’s less of the early adopter who’s going to, “Hey, I’ll pay 20 grand above sticker for this new electric truck,” and it’s more of a discerning buyer who’s maybe on the fence about it and has to be convinced. So I think that’s where you’re starting to see some headwinds in the industry. All the car companies went really big for a number of reasons. Now sales are still going up in the U.S., but the companies are having a harder time getting people to make that jump to electric because they’re more your everyday buyer. They’re trying to figure out how it fits into their life rather than just so enamored by the technology or what it can do for the environment. CURT NICKISCH: Why do people get enamored by the technology? I think what advantages do electric vehicles have? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think for a long time they were thought of as these glorified golf carts. I don’t think people really thought that they could have the capability and reliability, fun to drive, all the reasons why a lot of people choose their vehicle. I think Tesla really showed that EVs can be sporty and fun to drive, and so you get into one today and now many, many brands, I mean, the choice has really exploded in the last couple years. You can expect it to be super quiet, very zippy. You feel like you’re driving the future a bit. I’ll credit this to a colleague of mine, Dan Neil who writes a column for the Wall Street Journal on cars. He said, “If you drive an electric, going back to a gas engine car is like going back to whale oil lamps.” You know, not everybody. There are examples of people who just realize after six months, “Hey, maybe this isn’t for me,” but by and large people don’t go back. CURT NICKISCH: Is there any doubt in your mind that the industry is going to shift to electric vehicles? I mean, some people might say it’s a fad or it’s just not going to last. Inevitable, the title of your book came from Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, who said it’s an inevitable transition. What’s your opinion from your experience? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s funny, we actually titled the book before he said that, and so it was nice that we’re getting some backup from the industry. No, I think it is interesting because from the time I started the book, let’s say 2021 ish, it was all systems go. All of the companies were saying, “We’re pouring all of our capital into this. We’re going to have dozens of electric vehicles by X date.” GM made a lot of news when they said they were going to be fully electric by 2035. Then the slowdown, which we’ve already talked about, where consumers are like, well, not quite so fast. I think they did to a certain extent leave the consumer out of the picture when they were making these decisions. So now it is messy. You’ve got companies who are starting to slow walk some of their factory investments or cancel models. President Trump and Republicans have been pretty harsh on electric vehicles. They’ve made it known that… It’s become very politicized in the last couple of years, and we can talk a little bit more about why that is. So right now it looks like a tough time for EVs and it is in the U.S. That gets to why I think this goes from where it is now to inevitable is, in China… So everyone talks about the EV transition. There’s multiple transitions unfolding around the globe. China is the leader in EVs. Nearly half of all car sales in China are now either electric or plug in hybrid. This is really gets back to why it’s so difficult to be the leader of a car company today. If you’re Mary Barra sitting in Detroit. She took over in early 2014. One of her lines I remember at the time was we’re going to see more change in the next five years than we have in the last 50. Mary was one of the first big car company CEOs to declare this is what we’re doing, this is the path. For the company that puts out big Cadillac escalades and Corvettes that roar around the track, 8 cylinder, that’s a jarring thing to hear. Mary gets a lot of the credit for that. It’s a bit of an unfinished story because the execution of thoses EVs that she put the plans in place for the last decade have kind of stumbled, at least in the last several years. And now they’re starting to get really good cars out and they’re hitting this sort of demand headwind where consumers maybe aren’t showing up in ways that they expected. And only 5% of your sales are electric and you’re losing billions of dollars on that, and you’re making, I think they’re going to make something like 12 to 14 billion, that’s what they’ll have made in 2024. That all comes from big pickup trucks and SUVs. How do you play that? Europe’s somewhere in the middle, 20 to 25% of their sales are EVs. So you’ve got to decide, okay, am I going to lean into this thing that right now my investors don’t like and I’m losing a ton of money on because I know that in the future I’ll probably have to compete. She’s on record as saying the future is electric, so they have to put their money where their mouth is, but it hurts right now to do that. CURT NICKISCH: She’s one of the really interesting case studies in the book. Somebody who’s trying to manage that transition. You painted a picture where GM is making a lot of money by selling its quote, unquote, legacy vehicles, but also not seeing its stock price go up. Meanwhile, there’s this other company, Tesla, that’s putting out all electric vehicles, only electric vehicles. It’s not making money at that time early on, but its stock price was going up because investors thought that that’s where the future was going to be. And it was just interesting to see somebody who was making money as a CEO, but envious of the growth of a competitor stock price. What does that say about the business challenge that she was facing? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think if you look at Tesla, their investor base doesn’t look like the investors who go into the stocks of the traditional automakers. The autos is not a growth, it’s not been a growth industry for a very long time. So their stocks are assigned values that reflect that. It’s slow, steady, but investors don’t go into a stock like GM looking for a big moonshot bet on self-driving cars and electric cars. That’s a big source of frustration to the CEOs of these companies. For years, auto executives rolled their eyes or dismissed Tesla, didn’t think they’d ever get to be able to mass market cars. They wouldn’t be able to get their factories. Making cars is hard, and it was hard for Tesla. Once they punched through, I think that’s when they came out with a Model 3 around the 2018 timeframe. That was the proof point that I think the industry needed to say, “Okay, these guys are for real, and oh, by the way, their stock value just passed ours.” Then by the time you get to 2020, 2021, Tesla is worth more than the top 10 automakers in the world combined, market cap. So there’s two big reasons why the industry piled into EVs as seemingly suddenly as they did. One was boring. It was regulations around the world, climate change, regulators, politicians were trying to get a handle on that problem. CURT NICKISCH: Just to underline that there, they’re offering tax incentives and things like that for customers who buy EVs. So trying to tilt the economic playing field a little bit in the favor of electric vehicle adoption. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. The regulatory part of the story is more, it’s like carrot and stick. Yes. Incentives to get companies to make EVs and batteries and for consumers to buy them. Also, tougher regulations, right around tailpipe emissions, how much carbon you could emit and other pollutants. So over the years, the companies could meet those regulations through improvements to their gas powered vehicles and diesel vehicles. There were, I think the miles per gallon today is something like double what it was in the late ’70s. So there was tons of improvement in the internal combustion engine, but it got to a point where these regulations have become so tight, especially in Europe and China, that the companies needed to start to electrify. The regulations certainly pushed them in this direction, but the effect of Tesla and other startups, and now the Chinese really I think is what got the attention of the global auto CEO to say, “We’re getting left behind. Investors aren’t paying attention to us. We need to go in this direction.” CURT NICKISCH: You have a really great image, a good leadership lesson here in the book of Ford CEO, Jim Farley, meeting with his engineers and doing a teardown of a Tesla and a Ford electric vehicle side by side. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, Jim Farley, this is early 2022 when they did this exercise, and he’d only been CEO for a little over a year. He had been talking to some of his engineering leaders a few weeks beforehand, and he was pondering this question. He was one of the few auto executives who really was paranoid about Tesla back in the early days. So he’s always been looking over his shoulder at Tesla, and when he got to be CEO, he knew that that was going to be really his biggest nemesis or one of them. So he wanted to get a better handle on how Tesla had become so successful, starting to turn a profit at that point where really none of the traditional automakers were profitable. CURT NICKISCH: In EVs, yeah. MIKE COLIAS: In EVs. Right. So he questioned his engineering leadership. He said, “I don’t know that we’re designing these EVs in the most efficient way. What’s the difference between the way we do it and the way Tesla does it?” According to Jim, he was told that there really isn’t much of a difference. So he ordered up this dissection side by side of a Tesla Model Y and a Ford Mach-E, which had been… It’s an SUV. It’s really cool looking. It had done really well in the market. These teardowns engineers in the auto industry do them all the time; somewhat rare to have a CEO roll up his sleeves and want to get involved. So this empty warehouse in Dearborn near the headquarters, they had these two cars. They picked them apart. And the results were, there was a pile of guts laying on the floor next to the Ford that was a lot bigger than the pile of stuff laying next to the Tesla. There were brackets that didn’t need to be there, and there was something like hundreds of feet of wiring more in the Ford than there was in the Tesla. So it’s just all cost in weight, when weight is a killer when you’re trying to squeeze more miles out of an electric car. So he was upset about this, and the next week he paraded the board through this warehouse to show them this is what we’re up against. If we don’t figure out how to do this and get the cost out and compete with a company that has only been making cars really for five years, and we’ve been doing it for a century, we’re going to lose this. He’s really talked in terms of how this is an existential threat and battle that Ford is under right now. CURT NICKISCH: “Only the paranoid survive,” that was Andy Grove at Intel’s disruptive innovation lesson. What I liked about that story was just how it showed how a company that’s using a technology that leapfrogs you, that was it. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, it’s the innovator’s dilemma, right? Which I’m sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with. This idea that institutionally you almost have this subconscious aversion toward jumping to the thing that is going to be the next big growth area because it requires abandoning what you’ve done and what has worked so well for you for a century. And in this case, some of that inertia of how you design a car. It’s always been with a big engine block up front and a transmission running through the middle to the rear of the car. One of the executives I talk to a lot calls it scar tissue. They haven’t been able to figure out a real great, clean sheet design for electric vehicles, at least not until recently. Now we’re starting to see some of those come out. There’s a lot of great cars out there, but companies like Tesla and the Chinese are just, it’s sort of like you get the feeling they’re on versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, when many of the traditionals are one and 2.0. CURT NICKISCH: One really emblematic episode in your book is just when Tesla lowers its prices. So for a long time you’ve got these established car companies in the U.S., they realize that electrics are where they need to go. They start putting lots and lots of money into it. It’s all about cost. You have to drive those costs down and make it profitable at scale. They’re matching Tesla as a benchmark. And right when they feel like they’re about to put models into the market, Tesla lowers its prices. Can you describe just how meaningful that was and what that meant for these big car makers? MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, I think as you described, it was really this gut punch because this is early, right at the beginning of 2023. Until then, the EV story was really, EVs were taking off and you had people willing to pay above sticker price and on wait lists to get these new models. We were finally getting new cars, new EVs onto the market that weren’t Tesla’s. The other brands had finally gotten into the game and they were still not making money on these EVs. They didn’t have the scale yet. They’re only making a few thousand to start, and it’s still a money losing endeavor, but it was looking bright because the demand seemed to be there. When Musk took the step to weaponize his profit margin is what one executive described it to me, because by that time, Tesla’s profit margins, the company, the auto industry thought would never be able to be profitable, had been way bigger than the rest of the industry. So he had some headroom. He was more profitable than these other companies just on a company-wide basis, let alone the fact that these companies were actually losing money on their EVs and making money on gas power cars. So what he decided to do, and this might not… We don’t know exactly his reasoning. CURT NICKISCH: He said his reasoning was to democratize access to these vehicles. MIKE COLIAS: Right. And that’s a message that he’s had for a long time. He said many times that he started Tesla for environmental reasons and he wanted as many people as they could to drive electric cars. Competition probably played into it too. The other thing that’s super scary, I think for if you’re a CEO of a car company, what Elon Musk now believes is that it doesn’t really matter how much money I make on the initial sale of a car. I’m adding so much software, specifically self-driving software, to the point where if you own a Tesla, you’re going to be able to flip a switch and have it be a robot car and you could rent it out and have it serve as a driverless Uber. That’s going to be five times more valuable than this car company I’ve created. So he’s working on that, and it’s to be determined how soon or if and when that ever happens. The point is for the rest of the industry, if that’s what he believes, and he doesn’t care that much about what he prices his cars at, or if he prices them at a loss, that’s a big problem for the companies who are just scraping to try to turn up any kind of profit on their electric cars. It just completely pulled the rug out from under the rest of the industry. CURT NICKISCH: Meanwhile, I mean, we’re talking about a lot of US-based companies here, but you have Chinese electric vehicle companies driving a lot of innovation. I mean, I heard from somebody recently who said they would prefer some Chinese EV models to Mercedes, that they’re really that good. A lot of those are selling in Europe now, but there are tariffs in the US. You also have this, even for Tesla, you have the possibility of Chinese car makers disrupting Tesla or U.S. ones. MIKE COLIAS: Yes. Elon Musk has been quoted as saying that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive in the world now. It’s a fascinating story. I mean, this was one of the things that I found most surprising, and I had to research the Chinese market more. So a lot of the stuff in my day-to-day job, I just uncovered by covering the industry. I’d been to China a few times, but I didn’t really know the origin story and how they came to be such a juggernaut. I mean, they just made the decision to leap ahead. They knew they weren’t very competitive in internal combustion cars. The big global companies have been doing it for a century. The Chinese industry was young, and it was a conscious decision to invest in electric. Plenty of government money went into incentives for companies to build them and consumers to buy them. They invested heavily in the charger. I think there’s like 20 times more fast chargers in China than there is in the U.S. CURT NICKISCH: When you say they, a lot of this is government funded or government supported infrastructure investment. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah. Many, if not most of the Chinese automakers have some level of government ownership. People point out that federal government in the U.S. also provides subsidies and assists EVs. I think in China it’s at a much bigger scale. There’s also other advantages I think that those Chinese companies have been able to bring to bear. The supply chain is more developed, the raw materials for the batteries, cheaper labor. There’s all sorts of factors that have gone into the Chinese being able to make this stuff roughly a 30% less cost and expense that goes into their EVs. At the same time, as you alluded to, they’re really good. Many of them. They’re still cheap and cheerful brands over there. There’s brands that to your point, if you walked into a showroom and put it next to a BMW or a Tesla, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference and you might gravitate toward the Chinese one. I mean, the product is really good. So I don’t know of any auto executive who feels comfortable about with the fact that the governments are going to protect them with tariffs from the Chinese threat of EV makers who are making a lot of cars in China, too many. So now they’re exporting them around the world. So if you’re a CEO sitting in Germany or Detroit or Tokyo, I don’t think you’re going to be comfortable just assuming that those cars are never going to reach your shores. If you make a really good car that’s affordable, consumers eventually are going to demand them. Politicians are going to bend to that will. So I think Mary Barra, Jim Farley, a lot of these CEOs know that, and they know that they’re going to have to compete, even though China has arguably a decade headstart on this transition. CURT NICKISCH: One conclusion that you have in your book, and that’s at the moment that we are now, is that at least in the U.S. market, hybrid vehicles are the entry level electric vehicles for a lot of families still, a lot of drivers, that jumping directly to electric might not happen as quickly as people forecast. MIKE COLIAS: I think for the consumer and for the broader transition, I think that’s probably a good thing to have this bridge technology where people can get a feel for what electrons can do for your driving and your fuel consumption. So there are so many brands now that offer hybrid options across their lineups where you don’t have to plug anything in. It’s a motor and a small battery that sits in the background that actually many of them, it gives you a little more power. They’re more fun to drive, and oh, by the way, you’re getting 30 or 40% better fuel economy. So I think that’s an important part of this transition that a lot of the companies wanted to skip over because you’d rather just go to the end solution and pick one technology and go with that. Certainly GM, that was their strategy was we don’t really think hybrids are necessary. And they probably missed that one. They’ve said they’re going to now go back and offer some hybrids. 20 years ago, if you drove a Prius, it was like a stigma attached to that. Now people don’t think about it. There’s a bigger leap to make from a hybrid to a full electric in a car you need to plug in and monitor your charge and all that. There are bigger habits to change, but I see it playing out the same way where the more you see electric cars, know neighbors who have one get into them, people start to warm up to that idea of plugging in the car. You’re right. I think hybrids are going to be here for a long time. I think it’s another reason why we’re not going to hit, at least in the U.S. a tipping point real soon on the full electric story. CURT NICKISCH: Mike, this has been really interesting. So much at play in this industry, and it was great to hear about it. Thanks for coming on the show. MIKE COLIAS: Yeah, thanks so much, Curt. I really enjoyed the conversation.

I am an uber one member, but there is no mention of it being an uber one offer. Have attached a screenshot of what the banner looks like in post description Banner link from my second account If you have the deal it will show list of restaurants with red text "save on select items" Worked for me. $1.99 whopper with cheese after following your link dont see this on any of my two uber one accounts Not seeing it on my one account either. I found one item from a burger joint in my area, 81% off (Mofo Burgers carlton) Not currently Uber one member edit. Includes a bunch of fast food including red rooster, Betty's etc. It has worked for me and I don’t have uber one. $4.50 for a big boss burger at burger point Marsden Park. No Uber One here and yeah, hard to find places that have it but looks like Betty's Burgers and Red Rooster at least. Thank you OP Not much available except drab burgers. Hopefully some better offers around dinnertime. Thank you for sharing. Yeah got it too. It looks to be associated with Ubers current Cher promotions. All I have in my area is HJ’s and Red Rooster. Actually, every time you close it and reopen it, it changes the places. Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Strange when I refresh the Cher page the options do keep shuffling. The places don't change for me, just some disappear and reappear upon refresh Got a whopper cheese delivered for $5, thanks :) Not a uber one member and got the offer looks like pick up too nice edit: went with Barnacle Bills Chicken Burger, Chips and Coke for $3.97. Bargain. Appears to work with more than one order if you add two or more orders to cart before proceeding to pay for each seperately. I paid for two separate orders and the promotion applied to both. confirm this works Got one as a non-One member. Filter by "Offers" and every store with "Save on select items" will have something that's 80% off Scheduled a Beef Bacon Cheeseburger and Chips (RRP $21.50) from my local pub for $7 delivered. First time I've used UE in months. Thanks OP. Note not all stores with "save on select items". There are stores with that badge that won't have 80% off. Ah sorry - I checked 5 stores and they all had a discount in them. I think maybe they were pizza/burger type places so just got lucky (or unlucky) I guess. Got two separate orders burgers only? Works for burgers and pizza. Managed to get 4 orders before it stopped working. Chargrill Charlie, Betty’s work too Wanna know why these types of offers keep being restricted so much? Because of (inflammatory) like above abusing it and then bragging about it. and yet they still keep getting the deal? This is something for uber to fix on their end. think I got it but just 1 store after few browses. Got Fat Jak Johnny cheeseburger for $3.42 ex delivery/services thanks OP!! best ubereats deal in years! 2 pizzas for $10 👍 Pizza for $1.39 delivered 😂 I didn't get the Cher banner (and I'm not an Uber One member), but was able to find that some stores near me (Red Rooster, Chicken Treat, HJs) had the offer available. $1.99 Whopper with cheese for me… Same, but no pick up option. Mandatory Delivery fee is $6.49 for just 1.3km away makes it a non-deal. Time to try out other venues with cheaper delivery then. Thanks OP. Thank you for making me feel better about ordering uber eats tonight (I was going to do it anyway) Cher has turned back time on prices with 80% off select items Whooper is the only option at the time of writing. No sub and no use for long. Only offer in mine is 1.99 whopper. Has a $14.99 delivery fee attached, apparently due to current high demand. It’s 6.30am on a Tuesday. I’m an uber one member. No option for pickup. how do i get to it ?? Seems like its per day? Ordered yesterday - and the banner is back up again mine went from 8-10 options to just two after the first order. And no options for pickup. So it's confirmed promo not single use? Is it once per day or per restaurant (as in can you order from different eligible restaurants on the same day and still utilise the discount or does it re-set each day after single use)? I found that also, I've got 2 orders for Betty's burgers from two different locations on the same day, last time was yum OK sounds like it's once per restaurant then… if you managed to place 2 orders on the same day at different restaurants (albeit the same chain)? Maybe that's potentially why people are seeing less options the next day, even though the promo is still active on their account? Scummy of them to offer this only on the app which scrapes your data to sell to the highest bidder. I can access it on desktop too Where on desktop? I can't see anything with 80% off. from this link @CodeXD: Will give it a shot. Thanks. Edit: doesn't seem to come up on any of my accounts. Ordered yesterday, offer still shows today but much smaller selection (HJ’s Red Rooster and Betty’s) same Chargrill Charlie's is also on that list if one nearby, 1/4 chicken and chips by the way the promotion shows up on stores if you try to add items after ordering at another restaurant. I ordered two Whopper Cheese via HJ's, then I added a $5.60 meal from Betty's Burger, making the total to about $9 (without paying for delivery via uber one) You need to do this pretty fast before the offer expires, so I'd recommend those looking to use this trick to build the carts before ordering - it means you should just be able to enter each one and order before the promotion disappears. My local Hungry Jack's would let me add two Whopper with Cheese initially, but went I went to Cart, it said I exceeded the limit, and charges delivery + service fees. When I switched to an address in the city it allowed me to add two Whopper, charges service fees but not delivery fees. Got a Betty fried chicken burger (with pineapple) meal for $4.73 pick up. Good price. There's like 2 places in Sydney doing pick-up, rest are delivery only but as it's over $20 that's easy enough. Got a woodfired pizza from the local Italian restaurant for $5.60 delivered. No Uber One. Thanks OP Cheers OP, I was able to order 4 Whopper Cheese for $8.72. Back-to-back orders… or different accounts? If neither, what's the steps for ordering multiple burgers per order (as seems to be limited to one Whopper for me)? :) 1 order on 1 account. It depends on the branch as it was only possible add as many as you like at the LaTrobe St. branch. I ordered 2 whoppers at the Latrobe St branch. The driver took about 30 minutes to deliver to an address 5 minutes away by bike. According to the driver's profile, it's his 2nd day. I ended up lodging a complaint with the chat bot and got $5 compensation from an order that cost $4.44. @thangcuoi: Lodged a complaint with the chat bot for my order taking an hour to arrive, arriving cold after latest delivery time and looked to be tampered with. Got "Sorry we will not be able provide any credit for this" and advised me to instead change my rating for driver and restaurant. Really Uber?? how do chekc if targeted"?
