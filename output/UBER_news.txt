Reviews ethics statement These Alexa commands are built to help you take control of your life, one task at a time. Your day gets easier when you know which Alexa commands to use. Alexa may have been originally introduced as a voice assistant to help you with reminders or adjusting your music, but over the last 11 years it's come a long way. Now Alexa is getting a new upgrade. Alexa Plus delivers new AI-powered tools to become smarter, more conversational, and for the first time, more proactive than ever. It can control your smart devices, keep your calendar organized even if it changes, manage your Fire TV and even move from one speaker to another when you change rooms. Alexa is now integrated in a way that makes it easier to use. If you've been ignoring Alexa for a while, now is a great time to check out new commands and see if they can keep up with your busy life. This CNET survey found that 73% of US adults who use voice assistants still have privacy concerns with AI features, but Alexa was rated the most trusted option among them. If you own an Echo device, learning the right commands is the key to unlocking everything Alexa can do. Here's a full guide to the best ones to start with. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Amazon recently launched Alexa Plus, a major AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant. This new version brings significantly improved conversational abilities and smart home control. The upgrade costs $19.99 monthly but is free for Amazon Prime subscribers. The upgraded system, first demoed back in 2023, can handle more complex requests, remember personal details and perform multiple actions through natural conversation. With these spring cleaning and organization features, Alexa+ aims to make managing your home more intuitive than ever. Notable new commands include: Before that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response.

Today's top news: Friday was a big day for those companies entering the S&P 500. While a major crypto favorite was once again left out. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Robinhood (HOOD) will join the S&P 500 at the upcoming quarterly rebalance, replacing a departing constituent. HOOD shares immediately popped 7% on the news. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), despite checking all the requirement boxes, was not selected this cycle. MSTR’s recent price action certainly isn’t helping its case, down 16% this month while Bitcoin is only down 3%. It’s an exciting milestone to have Robinhood join the storied S&P 500 Index. I’ll share what I told the team today — we don’t stop to celebrate, our single focus remains building exceptional products for our customers. - Vlad Tenev, Robinhood CEO “Do you know which two companies didn’t make it into the S&P 500 last quarter despite meeting all the criteria? AppLovin and Robinhood. They were passed in June and both got in today on their second try. Same story with Uber and Tesla. Be patient. $MSTR will get there” - X user Angarlo First, the reason companies and their shareholders want to join the S&P is clear - huge rebalancing and ongoing inflows. Getting added to the S&P is almost a lock guarantee for near-term stock price increases (barring other macro factors). So it’s a big deal to be added. As for HOOD making it in over MSTR, the decision signals the committee’s preference for platform exposure over asset proxies. Robinhood’s inclusion validates a maturing, retail-first fintech that happens to have crypto in its product mix; it pulls another crypto-adjacent revenue stream directly into America’s most-tracked benchmark without making a call on any single token. By contrast, MicroStrategy’s pass suggests the S&P still wants operating cash flows and business diversification when it chooses members. For investors, the implication is straightforward: if you want crypto exposure inside the index, build a real business that uses it, don’t just warehouse it.

Original Coupon Deal Yes. If you like this - go for it. IMHO one of several 'Big House' champagnes that I actively avoid. This trades on the reputation of their very superior vintage wines - but is much debased. Good for ship launches. Not so good for drinking (for enjoyment). My 2 cents worth… Is these brands betters? Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Rose Vinotheque 2002 Well, Louis Roederer is the 'brand'. And yes it is better. AND you don't need to buy anything outrageously expensive (like Cristal). But if you're opening… :-) roederer NV is $90-$100, double the price of the moet in this deal. think moët just gets a bad wrap because they seem to make it in such large volumes and it’s readily available and affordable so makes champagne less of a prestige product, but some companies have access to the fruit and manage to turn out good product per $, dr loosen makes great riesling in volumes, guigal makes great rhone in volume, some companies have the resources and the process. Now you gotta give us your list! I found Cazanove vintage (2007, and '17 more recently) a great value buy when LL specials overlapped with good cashback rates. Hit ~$35 / bottle a few times per year but much rarer to see those prices now, usually $70+. Dangerous! What happens if people go out and buy what I like? Prices will rise and I'll cry/cry more! agree, usually buy as gift/congrats as it looks good. not bad drop just better imo. I don’t disagree, but it’s good to have some for people that think “champagne” is automatically better than sparkling wine, and also turn their nose up at names they don’t know. I’m not whipping out a twice as expensive bottle of Billecart Salmon for them. If you can find from Tassie - Lost Farm Cuvée Vintage 2017- ~39 per bottle. As someone who has provided many a Bolly discount here, I want to say that the Tassie drops are just as good, and offer an amazing value. Arras, Jansz, Taltarni are all fab. I also found the Gratien & Myer cremant at Dan's unbeatable at $17 but its out of stock… Would love to hear other tips!! champagne wise i like charles or n from dans, often at $50 mark, if just something with take-away, jacob’s creek trilogy at $12 - $14 as it has all 3 grape varieties, not many other australian sparkling have pinot meunier in them, also jacob’s creek reserve, it’s pinot chardonnay but bottle fermented if you only have $12-$14 , up market sparkling like the tassie mumm it’s my $35 fav along with pirrie but the mumm is often out of stock, champagne go to, like bollinger and roederer , but even on special it’s it’s a 2 bottle a year treat now. FYI $272.15 for a 6-bottles of Moet & Chandon Brut NV Champagne at Dan Murphys using the SEPT10 coupon combined with the instant Dan Murphys 5% egift cards from places like RACQ. So ~$45 per bottle. Mega, thank you ❤️ Or just buy one bottle for $49 after using the $10 discount https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/922583 Code not working for me anymore, getting an error message on payment saying that it’s expired. $171.20 for 2 Moet and 4 Chandon (2 for $50), 10% off then $25 both auto-applied at checkout, bubbles sorted, thanks OP :) Other recommendations also appreciated but no ex-First Choice anywhere convenient and Dan with stocks quite a hike :( All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

ASTP and HHS OIG will “take an active enforcement stance against health care entities that restrict patients’ engagement in their care by blocking the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information.” From Unashamed Cerner: “Re: Oracle Health layoffs. It’s tough being walked out, but remember that what you did here matters, whether it was for Cerner, Oracle Health, or an acquired company.

A Kansas City TV station confirms Oracle Health layoffs, adding that the company’s KC headcount has dropped from 11,000 during its Cerner days to 6,000 now. Online discussion was extensive.

It notes that radiology and cardiology are the most widely stored and viewed image types, with growth in some areas, but few organizations are storing POCUS (wound care and dermatology images) and little progress has been made in digital pathology usage. HHS will restore health and sciences webpages and data it had deleted as settlement terms of a lawsuit that was brought by the Washington State Medical Association. HHS had deleted information on pregnancy risks, opioid-use disorder, and AIDS under the White House’s order to stop using the term “gender.” New York City hospitals say that FDNY’s new policy that requires ambulance crews to take patients to the computer-chosen closest hospital – regardless of physician privileges, patient preferences, or condition – is endangering patients. FDNY’s commissioner disagrees, saying that “We’re not the Uber business or Lyft business to take people where they want to go” and that the change was needed to reduce 911 response times.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is no longer seen as the underdog. After years of doubt regarding its ability to generate profit, the company has successfully silenced detractors and generously rewarded its shareholders. The stock has risen approximately 30% over the past year and an impressive 50% year-to-date—compared to the S&P500 index, which has increased by 17% over the last year and 10% year-to-date. The pressing question is: with Uber finally prevailing on Wall Street, is there still potential for growth? Uber’s most recent quarter revealed $12.65 billion in revenue, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, while Gross Bookings grew 17% to reach $46.8 billion. Trips surged 18% to 3.3 billion, and net income amounted to $1.35 billion. However, the notable story is centered on cash flow. Uber generated $2.48 billion in free cash flow in Q2 alone, lifting the total for the trailing 12 months to over $8.5 billion. This financial strength enabled management to confidently announce a $20 billion share buyback, nearly 10% of the company’s market cap—a significant turnaround from the era when Uber was known for its cash burn. For those seeking growth with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and recorded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Alcoa Stock To Less Than $16? At current prices, Uber is trading at approximately 30x forward earnings and about 4x sales. This represents a premium over traditional transportation and logistics companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) at 13x or United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 16x, but is more reasonable than DoorDash stock (NASDAQ: DASH), which remains unprofitable and valued at 5.5x sales. Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), which is Uber’s closest competitor in the U.S., is priced lower at about 18x forward earnings but has not demonstrated the same scale or profitability. In essence, Uber is valued like a company that operates in two realms: more stable than a pure-play transport stock, yet not as richly valued as a high-growth tech platform. Investors are essentially wagering that Uber’s market position and cash flow can justify this mid-ground valuation. Despite its strong performance, Uber continues to face numerous challenges. Lyft remains a considerable competitor in ride-hailing, and DoorDash is competing aggressively in delivery. Logistics giants FedEx and UPS pose significant challenges in e-commerce. Moreover, Uber is making bold investments in its vision for the future: autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI-driven logistics. The company has invested substantially in partnerships with Waymo, Baidu, and others, and has even acquired a $300 million stake in Lucid to support its AV ambitions. In the long run, this could enhance profit margins by reducing the reliance on drivers. However, in the short term, investors are wary—autonomous technology is costly and its timelines are unpredictable. Uber’s stock has exhibited volatility during previous market downturns, at times performing worse than the S&P 500 index. Inflation Shock (2022) COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) The significant drawdown of 67% in 2022 indicates that a considerable decline from present levels is not extraordinary. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to investor caution. See – Buy or Sell UBER Stock – for further details. With the stock up nearly 50% this year, Uber no longer appears as a deep value turnaround—it is now priced for performance. Analysts anticipate that bookings will approach $49 billion next quarter, with EBITDA guidance exceeding $2.2 billion. If Uber continues to deliver growth at this scale while repurchasing shares, the rally could gain momentum. The risk? At 30x forward earnings, Uber has less room for error. Any slowdown in global demand, stricter labor regulations, or setbacks in its autonomous strategies could lead to declines. However, Uber has decisively shed its former reputation and presents itself as a cash-rich, scalable platform. Investors are no longer just along for the ride with Uber—they are actively steering the gains. The substantial valuation of UBER stock might curtail its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As a different option, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), providing strong returns for investors. The reasoning? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, further explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
