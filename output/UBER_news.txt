Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Liquid Mercury, a renowned provider of professional crypto trading and digital asset marketplaces, has announced a strategic partnership with dVIN Labs to launch an investment-grade wine trading platform collaboratively. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury provide a mechanism capable of powering the global order book for trading tokenized wine on the dVIN Protocol. With its design, the dVIN protocol seeks to leverage a combination of data, DePIN, DeFi, and tokenization to bring wine on-chain. Notably, dVIN’s mission to revolutionize the wine industry with blockchain-powered transparency and unified liquidity aligns greatly with Liquid Mercury’s decision to debut wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors. dVIN is a great fit for this partnership because it can solve the authenticity, verification, and provenance challenges that have relegated wine investment to an inefficient, niche activity that appeals to the well-connected uber-wealthy. David Garrett, co-founder and co-CEO of dVIN, commented on the partnership, saying, “The $300 billion investment-grade wine market is ready to be exposed to new investors and to become a liquid, tradable asset.” “Our goal is to make investing in wine as easy and efficient as investing in your favorite stock, cryptocurrency, or other favorite asset. We chose Liquid Mercury as our partner to create a liquid, global marketplace because our expertise in the wine market is matched by their team’s expertise in financial markets, laying the groundwork to unlock this exciting new digital asset class,” he added. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury, and dVIN join efforts to release a platform that will unify previously fragmented liquidity and turn investment-grade wine into a scalable asset class with democratized tools and access for retail investors and institutions alike. Furthermore, Liquid Mercury will provide white-labeled platforms for dVIN channel partners to onboard individual investors. These investors can gain instant access to wine from their favorite winemakers and exclusive wines held at bonded warehouses around the world. Also, Liquid Mercury will provide support for the dVIN global order book, which aggregates regional marketplaces and utilizes trading technology purpose-built to get the best price for buyers and sellers. Liquid Mercury CEO Tony Saliba also commented on the development saying; “Liquid Mercury is thrilled to partner with dVIN to unlock wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors…Our thesis for real-world assets has been that investing in culture is a powerful secular trend, and we know our battle-tested technology can reliably power new digital marketplaces, so we see massive potential in this partnership.”
