Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries.
