MFO’s founding mission is to “write for the benefit of intellectually curious, serious investors— managers, advisers, and individuals—who need to go beyond marketing fluff, beyond computer-generated recommendations and beyond Morningstar’s coverage universe.” But one of our core precepts is “80% of all existing funds could disappear today with no loss to anyone, except possibly the managers who have to explain it to their spouses.” The goodriddance group includes two overlapping sorts of idiocy: (1) many are launched at the behest of an advisor’s marketing department or strategic team. Short version: “hey, we need at least one bond fund if we’re going to keep their money in-house. Why don’t you go make one for us?” Or “everything who’s anybody has a target-date retirement series. Why don’t we have a target-date retirement series, hmmmmm???” And (2) many are cynical ploys to play on human weakness. Short version: “look, the guys in my fantasy football league know Tesla better than Musk does, and they want a way to do a quick-pivot from doubling down on Tesla’s morning performance to double-shorting it in the afternoon, so let’s do this crazy thing!” Through November 1,087 new funds and ETFs were launched in 2025. Of those, over 300 were niche trading toys: ether, hedged bitcoin, crypto index, altcoin, onchain, Litecoin, bitcoin covered call, long bitcoin / short ether, hedera coin, double-short Palantir, leveraged long + income Palantir, selling put options on ETFs that are double-long Robinhood Markets stock … The mix included six new ways to play Tesla, up or down, and one that combines Tesla and Uber, which gives us a total of 13 Tesla-specific ETFs. Bad news: these are designed to suck the life out of you, while convincing you that you’re better at this than Warren Buffett ever was. Look at column #3, dear friends: losses of 50-75% before they reach their first birthday. They are invitations to play a trading game where your reaction time is measured in minutes and your opponents’ are measured in milliseconds. Good news: these are going to perish in droves because they’re a bad idea and they can’t convince enough people long enough that they aren’t. That was the fate of the flood of internet funds (remember Nothing But Net?), blockchain funds, the flood of “green funds,” the flood of alts-for-the-masses funds, the flood of emerging market consumers funds … And yet, each year also brings several dozen legitimately interesting opportunities: often experienced managers or teams exploring new asset classes or extending proven disciplines in interesting new ways. We want to suggest that you add 10 notable rookies to your year-end research list. What makes these funds rookies? Our sibling site, MFO Premium, has an amazing fund screener which does calculations inconceivable on any site charging less than $12,000 a year (looks toward Chicago). One function of the site allows you to screen funds by age (from “launched this year” to “rookies” to “over 90 years old”). The rookie screener selects for funds with between one and two years of operation: long enough to take a few hits, short enough to remain fresh and interesting. What makes these funds notable? We screened each of six broad baskets of rookie funds – US equity, global equity, international equity, mixed asset, alternatives, and bonds – for funds that met two performance criteria. First, they had to have downside deviation ratings that were average-to-excellent. “Deviation” is a fund’s bounciness. Standard deviation measures the bounces both up and down. Downside deviation recognizes that you don’t object to having your fund bounce higher; you’re only steamed when it bounces down. So downside deviation measures a fund’s return below the risk-free rate of return; that is, if you make less in a period than the 90-day T-bill, you’re generating downside, and we’re measuring it. Second, they had to have Ulcer Indexes that were average-to-excellent. The Ulcer Index captures two metrics: how far a fund falls and how long it stays down. The logic is simple: if your manager (or index) falls flat on their face and struggles to get up, you’re going to get an ulcer. Big fall, long time down = major ulcer, high Ulcer Index. Little stumble, up and dusted off = barely any ulcer at all. That gave us a list of funds that, so far, have resisted the impulse to implode. We then sorted by Sharpe ratio – the most common measure of risk-adjusted returns – and began with the fund atop the list. If that fund shows two further criteria – it’s available to the general public, and it does not evidently rely on financial engineering, blackbox strategies, or disciplines so complex that I couldn’t explain them to myself – then we shared them with you. After that, I scanned the top 10 list in each category, asking the question, “What looks interesting here?” Our answers follow. What can I say? The ETF tracks an index of large cap companies that (a) put a lot of money into research and development and (b) have increased that commitment in each of the past three years. It ranks them, invests in the top 50, and rebalances once a year. The target is finding companies that are reinvesting in their own growth. Here are the particulars from First Trust: The fund’s Investors Guide is pretty thin. The short summary: the world is changing fast, R&D is essential to keeping up, and we find the most R&D intensive large caps for you. Plausible, though not a lot of depth there. The premise that companies investing heavily in R&D will matter more than those coasting on yesterday’s patents isn’t new. What’s new is that ‘R&D’ in 2025 increasingly means AI compute clusters and model training, not better mousetraps. First Trust isn’t picking winners; they’re just betting that the companies willing to light billions on fire today are more likely to own tomorrow than those protecting margin today. Those interested in a more active approach to the same discipline might consider Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund (IWIRX), a five-star actively managed fund that found life in the late 1990s as the Wireless (magazine) Index of innovative companies. Matthew and Ian do exceptional work. The $111 billion American Funds American Mutual Fund (AMRMX) annoys me. First, you’ve got this dumb reduplicative name. Second, they push it out in 19 distinct share classes. Third, it’s a whale: $111 billion, with low Active Share (58) and a 0.58% expense ratio on the “A” shares. That having been said, it’s also got $111 billion for a reason: it’s really good at delivering what it promises and has been so for a really long time. American Mutual does not specialize in raw outperformance – over the past 60 years, it has outperformed its peers by an average of just 0.3% per year – it specializes in getting you there with less trauma. MFO Premium tracks dozens of risk metrics, and AMRMX outperforms its peers on virtually every metric for virtually every trailing period. CGCV is the ETF version of that fund. While it is only 1% of the size of American Mutual, the ETF charges substantially less than the retail “A” shares of the fund for the same strategy and same management team. What you’re getting: Conservative Equity tries to balance current income, growth of capital, and principal protection. It typically holds about 90 stocks, primarily in well-established, dividend-paying US and Canadian companies with strong balance sheets. We checked 756 rolling three-year periods for American Mutual, dating back to 1960. The typical experience of an investor holding on for three years is a return of 11.0%. Its worst-ever three-year run was -11.0% and its worst-ever five-year span was -4.1% APR. The fund many people wished they were in is T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation, but you can’t have it. The fund has been kicking butt, under three different managers, since the 1980s: for every trailing period from one to 40 years, it has higher total return, higher Sharpe, smaller maximum drawdown, and lower Ulcer Index than its peers. And it’s closed. The fact that the success spans manager tenures suggests it’s the process that works, and TRP has been rolling out a suite of funds that incorporate variations of the discipline. This version is a mixed‑asset conservative fund that seeks total return by pairing income‑oriented fixed income with a risk‑aware equity sleeve, typically keeping roughly half to two‑thirds of assets in bonds and other debt instruments and the balance in stocks. With a 12.5% APR that is about 1.9 percentage points ahead of its peer group and a Sharpe ratio of 1.52, it has delivered competitive results with a profile designed to feel more like a cautious “paycheck plus growth” vehicle than an aggressive balanced fund. What really sets PRCFX apart is that it extends the discipline, team, and “capital appreciation with downside defense” DNA of the long‑closed Capital Appreciation Fund into a more income‑tilted format, giving investors access to a seasoned, franchise‑level process that was previously hard to reach. SEI is a manager-of-managers (MOM?) advisor. We all know that within any asset class (US equities), there are many sensible investment approaches, but no one strategy (large-cap momentum) works all the time. One alternative is that you could own three or four complementary funds and then shift their weight in your portfolio as market conditions change. Or you could surrender that particular fantasy and adopt a new one: you’ll hire someone who will hire managers representing three or four complementary strategies and will rebalance them for you within the fund. That “someone” is SEI. For SEEM, SEI hired three fundamental EM managers—one focused on quality, one on momentum with a small-cap tilt, one on value with macro overlay—and then uses their own quant tools to decide how much each should control. The goal is a broadly diversified, all‑cap portfolio across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and other developing regions. The fund has had an unusually strong first year, with both higher returns (29% APR vs 24% for its peers) and lower volatility (measured by maximum drawdown, standard deviation, and downside deviation) than its peers, leading to substantially higher risk-adjusted returns metrics (Sharpe ratio and Ulcer Index are strikingly higher). The fund has drawn $320 million in assets and charges 0.60% after waivers, a noticeable bargain price. One caveat is that the MOM approach does not tend to generate star performance. Morningstar tries it with their nine house-branded funds, seven of which are three stars or below. Litman Gregory (which now bears the ugly name iMPG) made it the heart of their business model in the Masters funds, only two of which survive. SEI has done exceptionally well with the model, but the caveat remains. The other is that not a single one of the thirty-eleven managers, including SEI employees, has invested a penny of their own money in the fund. GMO International Value ETF (GMOI) is the retail incarnation of GMO International Opportunistic Value (GTMIX), an institutional fund that’s been around since 1998. The strategy there (and here), is to concentrate on what GMO calls “deep value” stocks in developed markets outside the U.S., seeking total return from a heavily contrarian, valuation‑driven discipline. Its record since inception is exceptional, though perhaps a tiny bit irrelevant. It has outperformed its peers over every trailing measurement period (3-, 5-, 10-, 20-, inception), generally by 100 – 250 bps. Its risk metrics (maximum drawdown, standard deviation, downside deviation) are generally in line with or better than its peers, and its risk-adjusted returns metrics (Sharpe ratio and Ulcer index) are consistently better. The three current managers arrived in May 2023, meaning this 27-year track record is largely someone else’s work, even if the new team has decades of GMO experience elsewhere and responsibility for implementing the strategy that others have piloted. (And two of the three have declined to invest in the ETF.) The ETF has done well since launch. Its 31.7% APR beats its peers by 620 bps, and its risk metrics have been pretty much in line with its peers. The fund has gathered $215 million in assets in just over a year. This rookie vehicle is part of the rising wave of ETF launches, which give the rest of us access to an institutional‑grade GMO discipline that has historically lived in separate accounts and mutual funds.​ Rockefeller Capital Management launched a Global Equity Strategy in 1991. Marketed primarily for institutional clients, intermediaries, high-net-worth individuals, and family offices, the strategy has accumulated $4.5 billion. There’s no public performance record that we can find. The Rockco.com website is among the world’s most annoying, offering a rich and slow-loading visual experience with virtually no content concerning its investment capabilities beyond the moral equivalent of “we cool. We cool!” Here’s what we do know. The firm talks a lot about the overemphasis on short-term metrics among most investors (it has its roots in 1882 so the bias is explicable), about its global scope and unconventional sources of insight (mostly unexplained). The firm has three equity and three muni bond ETFs. The two older equity ETFs (Climate Solutions and US Small Cap Core) are … okay. Climate Solutions is in a meaningless peer group (Specialty / Miscellaneous), and Small Cap mostly tracks its peers. In October 2024, the firm launched Rockefeller Global Equity ETF (RGEF) with approximately $700 million in assets. This actively managed ETF invests primarily in large‑cap stocks across developed and emerging markets, using a bottom‑up fundamental process to build a 45–75 stock portfolio of companies with durable competitive advantages and a long‑term earnings runway. It has done quite well, on both upside and downside measures, in its short life. It has an APR of 23.2% versus its peers’ 18.9%, with dramatically lower volatility and a dramatically higher Sharpe ratio. Whether the advisor’s opacity reflects confidence born of 33 years managing money for people who know them personally, or simply indifference, is unclear. What is clear: investors considering RGEF are being asked to trust the Rockefeller name more than any articulated investment philosophy. This is the ETF version of Fidelity Hedged Equity Fund (FEQHX), a $550 million, four-star fund whose two managers are responsible for about $1 billion in hedged equity products at Fido. At base, the managers construct an equity portfolio that looks like the S&P 500 and then buy puts on their holdings to buffer the effects of market declines. The puts can rise in value when markets fall, so they make a positive contribution at much less than the cost of shorting stocks as a hedge. We long ago stopped reading Fidelity’s annual reports and manager “interviews” because they are so templated and sanitized that you learn virtually nothing from them, and that’s the case here, too. A chatbot comes across as much human and thoughtful. That said, the fund’s performance numbers are solid. Relative to an unhedged peer group, the fund posted solid absolute returns with 15-20% less volatility. FHEQ is an actively managed global large‑cap core strategy that owns a diversified equity portfolio while using put options and related techniques to buffer downside, targeting a smoother ride through equity cycles. Its 19% APR, about 0.2 percentage points ahead of peers, and a 1.81 Sharpe ratio suggest that investors have been reasonably rewarded for accepting the complexity and costs of its options overlay. The fund charges 0.55%, the ETF charges 0.48%. It’s a fascinating insight into the changing dynamics of the industry: the fund with the exceptional public record has drawn fewer assets in 40 months ($550 million) than the ETF has in 20 months. ($620 million). Capital Group Global Equity ETF (CGGE) is a global large‑cap core ETF that mimics American Funds Global Insight (AGVHX). Same management team, same discipline. Global Insight is an actively managed global large‑cap equity fund that aims for prudent long‑term growth of capital while seeking to limit downside risk. It invests mainly in established companies across the U.S. and international markets, with meaningful exposure to sectors like industrials, technology, and financials. It has a far larger non-US stake than its peers (44% versus 34%), low turnover, low Active Share, and more industrials (21% versus 13% for peers) than more. So far, that has not triggered a noticeable performance difference with its peers – it trails by 0.9% annually with a little less downside, leading to comparable Sharpe ratios. The ETF has performed exceptionally well, but that translates to “the ETF has operated for its first 16 months in a market that favored it;” its longer-term performance is likely to be another verse of the Global Insight song, “stodgy, cheap, reliable me!” The argument for the ETF is that it offers a more tax‑ and fee‑efficient wrapper. The ETF charges 0.47% on $1.4 billion in assets, the fund’s retail “A” shares ring in at 0.86% on $19 billion in assets. Palmer Square Credit Opportunities ETF (PSQO) is an actively managed, flexible multi‑asset credit strategy that allocates across CLOs, corporate bonds, ABS, and bank loans, drawing on Palmer Square’s existing opportunistic multi‑asset credit strategies and funds. Palmer Square frames it in terms of the opportunistic, relative‑value credit approach they’ve been running across separate accounts, funds, and other vehicles … but it does not identify one specific mutual fund or listed fund that PSQO is meant to replicate. The fund has only been around a year, but has dramatically outperformed its Global Income peer group in that period. The main “red flag” is that PSQO is a complex, opportunistic credit vehicle whose risk may only show up under real stress; it belongs firmly in the adventurous side of a bond sleeve, not as a core bond replacement.​ It has attracted about $107 million in assets over its first year of operation and charges 0.52%. Palmer Square CLO Senior Debt ETF (PSQA) tracks the Palmer Square CLO Senior Debt Index. Senior debt sits atop the stack of debts to get paid in the case of a default. As a general matter, CLO senior debt has returns like intermediate bonds but responds to a different set of risk factors. It is not high-yield debt, Palmer Square screens for securities with the equivalent of AA or AAA ratings, but like high-yield debt. CLO senior debt is sensitive to default or impairment rates but not sensitive to rising interest rates. The index has returned 3.46% annually since 2012 and 4.75% annually over the past five years, which sort of looks like this: The ETF itself has returned 5.9% in its first year with far better risk metrics than the average “loan participation” fund, so that its Sharpe ratio is twice as large. This strikes us as a “know what you own” story: structurally safer than mezzanine CLO exposure, but far from a simple investment‑grade bond fund, and not something to hold without tolerance for complexity and episodic drawdowns even if backward‑looking Sharpe ratios look excellent.​ Let’s start at Square One: I’m a fan of CrossingBridge. I’m amazed by the consistency with which David Sherman and his team have done exactly what they’ve promised: generated substantial upside with extremely well-managed downside in a collection of strategies that you can’t find elsewhere. I’m invested in two of their funds, Chip is invested in one, and MFO’s tiny “endowment” is, too. We wrote about CrossingBridge Nordic High Income Bond Fund (NRDCX) at its launch, and it has done well since. They seek high income and capital preservation while investing in bonds issued, originated, or underwritten in the Nordic countries. Part of the corporate DNA is a willingness to pursue small issues and event-driven ones that larger managers could not exploit. They see the Nordic markets as embodying a sort of gold standard for corporate governance and transparency, report that Nordic bonds represent better values than US high yield, and believe that the Nordic region has a distinctive market niche. For high-yield investors looking beyond the US, this is the quintessential “get this on your due diligence list” fund. Miller Market Neutral Income Fund (MMNIX) is a relative‑value, market‑neutral strategy that seeks positive total return with low correlation by emphasizing convertible and synthetic convertible structures, using long/short and hedging techniques to dampen broad equity and rate risk. To be clear, this isn’t the famous “Miller” and the CIO’s leadership of “Wellesley Asset Management” isn’t the Vanguard Wellesley. This Miller and this Wellesley are convertible bond specialists primarily serving an institutional clientele and managing about $2 billion in assets. At 9.8% APR, about 1.9 percentage points above its market‑neutral peers, and with a 3.80 Sharpe ratio, it fits our “alternatives with real risk‑adjusted payoff” preference, but (1) the 1.69% expense ratio is way high, and (2) it appears that it’s only available to institutional investors. I mention it here for the benefit of our professional readers who might have avenues to access a specialist shop’s flagship. SGI Enhanced Core ETF (USDX) is an “absolute‑return‑ish” bond and options hybrid that holds a diversified portfolio of high‑quality, short‑term money‑market instruments while running an actively traded put‑and‑call overlay on broad equity indices such as the S&P 500 to generate incremental income. Morningstar, by the way, likes no part of it. Or, more narrowly, Morningstar’s machine-learning analyst likes no part of it. That having been said, it’s posted pretty much top 1% returns since its launch about two years ago. The combination of very short‑duration fixed income and options‑driven yield is a sort of complexity trade: potentially smoother performance than long‑duration bonds, but with structural and behavioral risks that require some sophistication and tolerance for an expense ratio of 1.05% for a bond ETF. The advisor, Summit Global of Bountiful, Utah, manages about $760 million and advises five funds. Where to start, where to start? Hmmm … I really like the leadership of Bridgeway Capital, and once invited founder John Montgomery to speak to the students at the Institute for Leadership and Service at Augustana. That reflected two things: first, Bridgeway’s unswerving commitment to follow the evidence rather than the crowd, and their deep commitment to serving their community and their investors. John was obsessively cheap long before Vanguard and ETFs made it the vogue. Mr. Montgomery’s analysis of “the small company effect” led him to the conclusion that only the smallest of small companies – those in the so-called tenth decile – actually manifested it, and so their very first fund, Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company, which targeted companies so small that it had to have a hard close at just over $25 million. That having been said, the firm has seen relentless outflows and inconsistent performance over the past decade. So, here’s the story: Bridgeway Global Opportunities Fund (BRGOX) is trying to offer long-short “hedge fund” capabilities at mutual fund prices. It is an equity market‑neutral strategy that aims for long‑term positive absolute returns by running a roughly dollar‑neutral long/short portfolio in U.S. and foreign stocks. (Market-neutral and dollar-neutral translates to: our returns are independent of the stock market and currency fluctuations.) The key differentiator is Bridgeway’s work on “intangible capital” such as research & development spending. Accounting rules treat R&D as outflows, like the cost of buying coffee for the breakroom, not as investments. As a result, traditional metrics undervalue them. Here’s Bridgeway’s official description of what they do: Global Opportunities seeks consistent risk–adjusted absolute returns agnostic to market direction, with reduced volatility and granular diversification. Our systematic stock selection approach targets inefficiencies and opportunities in global markets. Innovations in accounting theory and financial analysis are employed to evaluate company fundamentals contextually, opening the opportunity to capitalize on slower price discovery in overlooked market segments. Limited discretion is applied when research assumptions do not hold. Our portfolio construction process is designed to emphasize idiosyncratic over systematic exposures. Bridgeway has published three peer-reviewed articles on the investment relevance of intangible capital, and the fund has done well so far. Bridgeway’s well‑documented commitment to donating a large share of profits to charity, its quantitative research ethos, and its history of sometimes brilliant but inconsistent funds make BRGOX feel like a high‑conviction expression of a very distinctive culture—one that investors may admire for its mission and process even if they should be cautious about extrapolating early‑stage performance.​ Final note, the fund charges a lot, 1.63% on assets of $34 million, if you think of it as a mutual fund, and not much at all if you think of it as a hedge fund. Your call! The flood of crypto derivatives and leveraged trading toys will wash out as it always does, leaving behind a small cohort of genuinely interesting opportunities. The lowest-risk rookies are precisely what MFO has always hunted for: experienced managers with solid, verifiable track records who are now available in new forms, whether that’s Capital Group’s franchise strategies wrapped in lower-cost ETFs, GMO’s institutional disciplines accessible to retail investors, or T. Rowe Price’s closed-to-new-money process extended into a complementary vehicle. These aren’t experiments or marketing plays. They’re proven managers bringing tested disciplines to investors who couldn’t previously access them. The question isn’t whether these strategies work, many have decades of demonstrating they do, but whether the new wrapper fits your portfolio. For serious investors willing to look past the noise, that’s a far more promising starting point than whatever Tesla-leveraged monstrosity launches next month. David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).

To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Another week, another round of announcements about robotaxis either launching or planning to in cities. Let’s take stock. Waymo started testing its autonomous vehicles (with a safety monitor) in Philadelphia and will start manual driving to collect data in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh; Uber and Avride launched a robotaxi service in Dallas that will initially include a human safety operator behind the wheel; and the California Department of Motor Vehicles released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways in the state. Autonomous vehicle tech is scaling and the pace is quickening. But should it? As autonomous vehicle tech percolates into the cityscape, so has the criticism and challenges. A couple of recent incidents illustrate this point. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Waymo for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. The agency already opened an investigation into Waymo’s performance around school buses. Then there is KitKat, the bodega cat that died after a Waymo robotaxi ran him over on October 27. The company was already facing criticism over the event. And now it might escalate thanks to new video. The NYT tracked down surveillance video that shows a woman crouching beside the Waymo trying to lure KitKat to safety before the vehicle suddenly pulled away. A lot of changes have been happening at Lucid Motors recently, according to some little birds. As many of you already know, the company has lost a number of top executives, including former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson and most recently, chief designer Eric Bach. Lucid, which is in the middle of ramping up production of its Gravity SUV, has patched some of these vacancies with a mix of internal promotions and outside hires. And the changes keep coming. A few little birdies told us this week that a handful or more of top managers on its software and electrical teams were let go, including two senior directors who started with Lucid around a decade ago. Got a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com. Electric aircraft maker Beta Technologies, which went public last month, is carving out a nice little supplier business for itself. Which is fitting since the Vermont-based company is aiming to be an OEM to the aviation sector. The company locked in a deal to supply air taxi company Eve Air Mobility with its electric pusher motors. Beta says the agreement is a potential 10-year opportunity valued at $1 billion. Of course, “potential” is an important hedge. That $1 billion is not guaranteed, even if shareholders translated it as such (stocks popped 8% following the news). Still, Beta is finding a near-term revenue path as it continues to work toward the commercial certification of its electric aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration. The company also reported its third-quarter earnings this week. Beta saw its revenue more than double to $8.9 million from the same quarter last year. Its net losses have also grown. Beta reported net losses of $452 million in the third quarter, a more than fivefold increase from the same year-ago period. Other deals that got my attention … Autolane, a Palo Alto-based startup developing the “air traffic control” for autonomous vehicles, raised $7.4 million in a round led by VC firms Draper Associates and Hyperplane. Element Fleet Management, an automotive fleet manager, acquired San Francisco-based connected vehicle payments company Car IQ. The terms weren’t disclosed, but sources with information on the deal told TechCrunch the acquisition price was $80 million. History lesson: back in 2024, Canada-based Element Fleet Management acquired fleet optimization software startup Autofleet for $110 million. ExploMar, a China-based developer of electric propulsion systems for boats, raised $10 million in a Series A round. The investment was jointly led by private equity funds and a listed company in China (not disclosed), with existing shareholder DCM Ventures continuing to participate. Heven AeroTech, a startup developing hydrogen-powered drones, raised $100 million in a Series B round led by American quantum computing company IonQ. The company’s post-money valuation is now more than $1 billion. Texas Venture Partners also participated. Wayve, the buzzy U.K. self-driving startup backed by Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank Group, acquired German startup Quality Match, which analyzes data used to train AI models for automated driving. Terms weren’t disclosed. Amazon is considering ending its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service and building out its own competing nationwide delivery network. Tesla owners can text and drive with the latest version of the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assistance software, despite the fact that it’s illegal to do so in most states. Grand Theft Auto Online has added robotaxis from a fictional-yet-familiar company dubbed “KnoWay,” whose sole purpose appears to be wreaking havoc. Nvidia announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research. TechCrunch’s Europe-based reporter Anna Heim gives an inside look at a drone delivery partnership in Finland. The Trump administration said it will lower fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States, arguing it will make vehicles more affordable. There’s a trade-off, though. Consumers could end up paying more for gas. The reduction essentially brings vehicles below what they’re achieving already. The proposal would roll fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations. Back before Thanksgiving, we did a poll in the Mobility newsletter asking, “When do you expect robotaxis to reach a tipping point of mass adoption that will affect how people move from Point A to Point B?” Most readers picked “before the end of the decade,” which received 47.2% of the vote, followed by the “2030s.” Based on your votes, there appears to be low confidence that 2026 will be the year of the tipping point.

Title: 'Get all that Hermes stuff now': Netflix director accused of $11 million fraud rushed to buy luxury goods, texts show

After Carl Rinsch got an infusion of $11 million from Netflix to finish his passion project — a futuristic television series — he could sleep well at night. That's partly because he bought a $439,000 handmade mattress on what prosecutors say was on Netflix's dime. At Rinsch's criminal fraud trial in Manhattan federal court on Friday, jurors heard more about the director's spending spree from some of the people who witnessed it firsthand. His former personal assistant testified that he compared himself to a character in a movie who had 30 days to spend $30 million — or lose it all. Prosecutors also called to the stand a salesman who waxed on about the handmade Swedish mattress he sold Rinsch, complete with a "sleep doctor" to massage it for him. Rinsch liked the Hästens Grand Vividus mattress so much that he decided to buy a second one, the salesperson testified Friday. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch defrauded Netflix by misusing funds for the production of "White Horse" — a show about artificial beings who create their own society on Earth after a schism with humankind. Rinsch filmed portions of "White Horse," but went over budget and never finished a single episode. On Friday, jurors heard more testimony from Maria Skotnikova, who worked as a personal assistant for Rinsch and made logistical arrangements for the filming of "White Horse." Skotnikova said Rinsch made multiple luxury purchases after Netflix gave him an additional $11 million in March 2020 to finish the project, including a rush to buy Hermes goods. "Get all that Hermes stuff now," Rinsch told Skotnikova in one August 2021 text message sent to the jury. "This is your job," he texted her a short while later. "We have to do this. Or else the money goes bye-bye. Get it." According to Skotnikova, Rinsch compared his situation to "Brewster's Millions" — the 1985 movie about a man who learns he received a $30 million windfall from a family member but must spend it all within 30 days. Skotnikova also testified Thursday about driving to meetings in Ferraris and Rolls-Royces, vehicles an FBI forensic accountant said Rinsch purchased using money that originally came from Netflix. Skotnikova said Friday that Rinsch tried to purchase a large amount of furniture from the French designer Jacques Adnet, which he considered "interesting and underappreciated." Rinsch, known for directing "Ronin 47" with Keanu Reeves, wanted to have a "monopoly" on the designer's furniture pieces so he could "control the price," Skotnikova testified. The spending spree also included over 480 food takeout orders on Postmates and Uber Eats in a six-month span in 2022. The FBI forensic accountant previously testified that Rinsch moved the funds from Netflix through different accounts, invested a portion of it in the stock market and cryptocurrency, and spent other amounts on what appeared to be personal uses. Later Friday, jurors heard from Johan Ericsson, who served as the top Hästens salesperson on the West Coast of the US. He said he met Rinsch in 2021, when the director went to the brand's Los Angeles store. Rinsch purchased four mattresses for a total of $617,610.66, records show. He received a discount because he bought floor models rather than having them individually handmade in Sweden, Ericsson said. The highlight was the Grand Vividus in the "black shadow" colorway. It was the top-of-the-line model that took over 700 hours to make, Ericsson said. The Grand Vividus is not just a mattress, but a "sleep instrument" that includes a base and leather headboard, and comes with a "bed doctor" who visits your house to massage the mattress, according to Ericsson. Rinsch was so pleased with it that he later modified his order to get an additional Grand Vividus mattress rather than three lesser Hästens models, according to Ericsson. "These are two very special beds," Ericsson said. US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is overseeing the trial, chastised prosecutors for allowing Ericsson to spend so much time on the witness stand waxing lyrical about the qualities of Hästens mattresses. "I was going to call it a sales pitch, but he obviously deeply believes in the brilliance of these mattresses," Rakoff said. Ericsson said that Rinsch never spoke with him about using the mattresses for the production of "White Horse." Rinsch's defense lawyers say he's innocent, and the case is really about a "creative genius" who was overwhelmed by the challenges of the project and didn't get the support he needed from Netflix. In a deposition for a separate legal proceeding, which was entered into evidence in the criminal trial, Rinsch was asked why he purchased "a mattress that costs $450,000 for this production." "Because it retains value," Rinsch said. "And a mattress that you spend $30,000 on is worth zilch, but a mattress that you spend $450,000 on — guess what? It's worth a hundred grand more now. So hey, what are you gonna do?" Prosecutors told Rakoff they expect to finish presenting their case on Monday. Rinsch — an engaged and jittery presence in the courtroom — hasn't said whether he will take the witness stand while his lawyers present his defense case. Jump to

Economy Class & Beyond 05/12/2025 by Kevincm Leave a Comment Why yes, I’m trying to avoid writing something else. Or is it booking something else? So, a quick food adventure before I get back to booking something… In this Trip Report: It’s time for a poor-quality, unplanned food adventure post. Because people like food photos, ideas and my bad planning going up in flames. Some plans fell through the floor (be it from exhaustion from overstimulation or being awake for way too many hours), others… I’ll go into in-depth. I tend to stop here to stock up for a weekend, as filled Chinese meat buns are never a bad thing to have to nibble during quiet moments. I’ve written about this bakery before – and it’s a place I return to for supplies and snacks, since i learned about it in the Eater Documentary. Put it like this, it’s one of the main stops on my Chicago trips. I remember Paris Baguette (and quietly laughing at the name) when I went to Seoul in 2009 (and yes, it’s a South Korean Company). It seems the company has spread out since then, opening branches around the world. It sells a mixture of sweet and savoury items… and your author was in a savoury mood that day. The branch I visited was on the main street in Chinatown. But strangely, Paris Baguette was out of baugettes. Lonely baguette stand is lonely. I had a crab and a meat croquette. They were warm and filling for the price of $9. This is one I can’t review fairly, mainly because whilst uten siles were requested, they never turned up. Thus, all I could get was the Wonton soup, which was hot and passable. The Mongolian Beef was passable when it was cold, but I suspect it would have been better hot. It didn’t help that I couldn’t find my chopsticks to eat with. You’d think that at this point, I’d have multiple pairs of chopsticks within grabbing distance. Nope. Not a chance. Exhaustion got the better of me during this trip (again), so by 9 pm I had a choice – a disappointing order-in pizza, or head out to a decent pizza joint. And Peaquods Pizza is a decent and well-priced pizza joint. I grabbed one with Cheese, Sausage, Pepperoni and Giardiniera, with the meat adding protein, the Giardiniera adding acid to cut through the grease. And yes, it took me most of the week to polish it off when I got home. For those who remember the classic Olympic Grill sketch from Saturday Night Live, the Cheezborger! Cheezborger! Cheezborger! comes from The Bill Goat Tavern. I visited the “original” branch, which is under North Michigan Avenue. It’s not hard to find, head to the Plaza of Americas (behind The Wrigley Building) and take the right-hand stairs down. Turn around on yourself, and you’ll find the Tavern. They’ve got other branches in the area, so it might be worth seeking out one if you’re looking for a particular branch near you. I was basic. I had a single cheeseburger with Coke. The place had the atmosphere of a thousand conversations held, hushed or otherwise, with tales to tell. And it felt those stories were genuine, compared to larger chain places. As for the burger – well, a solid burger. With fixings to help yourself to (that I missed), with a Kaiser bun and a freshly cooked patty with melted cheese… It’s a pretty nice burger, at a reasonable price. And reasonable price is something that you don’t get sometimes in Central Chicago, unless you’re going to the big fast-food chains. Right. Onto normal travels. Time to head back to O’Hare.

Title: WeRide Attracts Public Investments as Top Funds Back Its Autonomous Mobility Growth

December 04, 2025 05:14 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (NASDAQ: WRD, HKEX: 0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, has attracted investment from ARK Invest (ARK), a leading investment firm managed by Cathie Wood. Based on its public disclosure, ARK acquired a total of 858,295 WeRide American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from public markets over the past three trading days, indicating confidence in the company's growth prospects and long-term strategic positioning in the autonomous mobility market. ARK’s investment aligns with its focus on disruptive innovation, as autonomous mobility is on track to become a multi-trillion-dollar global market, with robotaxi fleets potentially reaching tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, according to ARK's "Big Ideas 2025" report. WeRide is well positioned to capture this growth, with over 1,600 autonomous vehicles (AVs) internationally and presence in over 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is the only company whose AVs hold autonomous driving permits in eight countries – China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and the US – highlighting strong regulatory trust in its technology. Earlier this week, Bank of America (BofA) initiated research coverage on WeRide at Buy with a price target of US$12 for its ADSs listed on NASDAQ and HK$31 for its Class A Ordinary Shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This represents an upside potential of 45.6% and 50.0% respectively, based on the November 28 closing prices of US$8.24 and HK$20.66. Other recent Buy ratings include Bank of China International (BOCI) (September 29, target price: US$20.00, 96% upside potential) and Citi (November 7, target price: US$15.30 and HK$39.601, 62% upside potential). Based on recent public filings, WeRide’s shareholders now include leading global institutions such as Bosch, Fidelity Management & Research, Greenwoods Asset Management, Hudson Bay Capital, Invesco, M&G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, NVIDIA, Temasek and multiple other long-only and sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East, among others. Grab, Southeast Asia's leading superapp, and Uber, the world’s largest mobility and delivery technology platform, are also shareholders in WeRide. WeRide’s strong Q3 2025 performance reflects the confidence shown by ARK and other major shareholders. WeRide recorded revenue of US$24.0 million, up 144.3% year-on-year (YoY), with its core Robotaxi business delivering US$5.0 million in revenue, up 761.0% YoY. Gross profit grew 1,123.9%, while gross margin rose 26.4 percentage points to 32.9%, placing WeRide among industry leaders and underscoring its path toward profitability. Founder and CEO Dr. Tony Han noted in a recent CNBC interview: “I'm very optimistic with WeRide's leading position in the global market and our technology. Profitability is a sure thing." This success stems from WeRide's commitment to staying at the forefront of the fast-evolving autonomous mobility market. WeRide One, the company’s universal autonomous driving technology platform for L2 to L4 vehicles, integrates full-stack software algorithms, modular hardware solutions, and cloud-based infrastructure, enabling strong synergy across mobility, logistics and sanitation products on open roads. WeRide’s rapid global expansion has not gone unnoticed among investors, supported by its proven track record in navigating complex regulatory environments and in consistently being a first mover across international markets. Notably, the company obtained the world’s first city-level fully driverless Robotaxi commercial permit outside the United States in Abu Dhabi and has already launched the fully driverless service on the Uber platform, with the operation on track to achieve breakeven unit economics. Besides Abu Dhabi, WeRide's AVs are deployed in Guangzhou, Beijing, Singapore, Riyadh, Dubai, Leuven (Belgium), etc., and its Robotaxi secured a driverless permit in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. WeRide plans to deploy 500-1,000 Robotaxis in the Middle East by end-2026, and tens of thousands worldwide by 2030. WeRide has achieved fully driverless Robotaxi operations in Guangzhou, Beijing and Abu Dhabi, and in Abu Dhabi, the WeRide-Uber Robotaxi service covers about half of Abu Dhabi core areas. BOCI analysts recently noted that "WeRide is poised to stand out as one of the final winners" as the global robotaxi industry scales. Reflecting this positive outlook, ARK’s stake in WeRide, alongside a strong shareholder base and Buy ratings from BOCI, BofA, CICC, Citi, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and other leading investment banks, demonstrates confidence that WeRide’s strategic execution and growing commercial footprint will drive long-term shareholder value. About WeRideWeRide is a global leader and a first mover in the autonomous driving industry, as well as the first publicly traded Robotaxi company. Our autonomous vehicles have been tested or operated in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We are also the first and only technology company whose products have received autonomous driving permits in eight markets: China, the UAE, Singapore, France, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, and the US.

Kevin Rose: Tim-Tim, another episode of The Random Show. Glad to be back. Tim Ferriss: Another episode of The Random Show. Kevin Rose: This is awesome. Tim Ferriss: You look very dashing. For people who can’t see you, you have hair slicked back, jacket with wide open lapels, reminiscent of a leather jacket. You look like a leading man from The Outsiders, that movie back in the day. You just need a cigarette in your pocket and some other goodies, but you’re looking good, looking good. You also have, as you disclosed to me, your secret weapon nearby an IKEA light that is providing very seductive shadows and contours on your face. So, well done. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think we’re both hacking it together today. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, today has been putting together the boxcar on the way down the hill in a sense, from an equipment standpoint, but here we are. Kevin Rose: Here we are. Tim Ferriss: We made it. Now, you asked me to grab a glass of wine, which I didn’t do. I ended up grabbing a glass of Gin, Caledonia Spirits Barr Hill gin. For anybody who’s curious, I do like my gin, B-A-R-R Hill. But this might surprise people and it surprised me because last time we spoke, I think you had hit, what was it, six months or however long it was. Six months sober. So what is unfolding before our very eyes? Kevin Rose: Well, what’s unfolding is a glass of champagne is what’s unfolding, but I’ll say that I almost made it to seven months, but then I just decided — my original goal was three months, and then I made it to six, and was I going to continue to go on like this? And I had hung out with some friends. We had a dinner in San Francisco, and I thought, “You know, I’m going to have a glass of vino. I’m just going to have a glass of wine because I don’t want to make this…” It was actually, there was a great book. You know the book Awareness, which you’ve recommended to me. Tim Ferriss: It’s one of my favorites. I have one of my many copies downstairs right now. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: Yeah. So, Anthony de Mello, Jesuit priest. Correct? Is that right? Tim Ferriss: Jesuit priest, who is also a psychotherapist who is now since passed, but incredibly, incredibly compelling writing. I’m sure we’ll get more into this because I listened to the audiobook you recommended, so we’ll come back to that. Kevin Rose: Oh, cool. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But all right, so take us back to the story you’re telling. So, you’re sitting there — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Well, prior to that, I had re-listened to that book and I got it on audio. And one of the things that hit me that he said in the book was — Tim Ferriss: I know what it was. Can I guess? Kevin Rose: Yeah, you do. Yeah, go for it. Tim Ferriss: That abstinence or asceticism. Renunciation is as much a trap, or can be as much a trap as anything else because it ties you, it binds you to the thing that you are from. Kevin Rose: That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. It makes it your lifelong enemy. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And it binds you to it. And so, you’re like, “Fuck it, Yolo. Let’s have some wine.” Kevin Rose: Well, I want to be bound to it. And then I did that with a glass of wine, so no, but I — Tim Ferriss: Break those chains. Kevin Rose: Yeah, exactly. But the plan was never to be sober for life. It was to reevaluate my relationship with alcohol and get to a point where I could truly say to anyone that asks, the cravings have gone away. And my goal going forward is something I just call the 2-2-2 rule, which is maximum of two drinks at any given night, never two days in a row, and then two days a week. So, just lightweight. That’s my new thing. And then also special occasions, I want it to be about a celebration of something or a gathering in some way that’s meaningful, not just because a football game’s on or something. Tim Ferriss: Well, first I have more to say, but cheers. I have my little Japanese mug — Kevin Rose: Cheers. Tim Ferriss: — full of Barr Hill gin. Cheers. Kevin Rose: Wait, wait, straight up gin? Tim Ferriss: That’s just straight gin. I didn’t have any ice. You’ve inspired me to cut way back on my drinking, so I haven’t really had much. I don’t want to open a bottle of wine that I’m not going to finish with friends or something. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I mean, you finished your bottle of gin. Tim Ferriss: So I just grabbed what I had open, which stay good for a long while once open, which was this gin. So, I’m not going to drink a full glass of gin, but I will have a sip with you. Kevin Rose: I think we’re both going to be cheap dates maybe then, because if we haven’t drank in a while, we might get really sloppy really fast. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, very, very cheap dates. So, let me follow up on this story and the 2-2-2 plan. How are you intending, if at all, to catch yourself if you start slipping? Do you have people who you want to hold you accountable? Do you have some type of calendar reminder in place? How do you keep an eye on that? Recognizing that you may very well be totally fine, but given the history that you have, it seems like it’d be a good idea to put some guardrails in there. Kevin Rose: Well, I agree with you wholeheartedly if my issue with alcohol had been one of excess consumption in that, I was never a six or seven drink or even five drink person. For me, it was more consistency. So, the one that is easier to catch is you wake up the next morning and you say, “Okay, I’m just not drinking tonight because you’re catching it in a sober state, which is huge.” So, it’s the big foul that I had over the last few years, especially to start with COVID was just two drinks a night, maybe three, and just continuing that and taking a day or two off a week, that’s not healthy as my liver enzymes would report back. I’m not as concerned about that. But also, I’ve talked to my therapist about this and she’s amazing. And she’s like, “Hey, I’m going to check in with you and just make sure that you’re truly sticking to this.” But I think an accountability partner is absolutely a necessity, especially when it’s been such a staple of your life for decades. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. And I think for you, one thing that immediately hops to mind, which seems super mundane, but I know you have a lot of anxiety around flying, and I don’t think that flying counts as a special occasion, right? So, you’ll need to — Kevin Rose: Oh, it absolutely does. It absolutely does. That flying — Tim Ferriss: You fly so much though. Kevin Rose: We are in the air, we shouldn’t be able to do that as humans. It is an amazing feat of engineering. So, yes, it’s special. Tim, don’t take this away from me, God damn it. Tim Ferriss: All right. Wow, I’m going to — Kevin Rose: This is one thing. Tim Ferriss: I’m going to call that the yellow flag in the making, but you know what — Kevin Rose: I’m fine with one yellow flag. I do fly a bit, but you know what’s funny is when I came back from SFO when I actually had that first drink, I didn’t want a second drink on the plane. And honestly, it’s that just like anxiety of the whole process of it all, the security and the packed jets and the people coughing next to you. And once I get settled, I’m pretty good, unless it’s an international flight and I’m with friends. So, yeah, I think it’s that first drink actually goes a long way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. On that note, first drink goes a long way, especially if it’s just straight up gin. Kevin Rose: There you go. Tim Ferriss: Where else should we segue? Because we can come back to this, but we have a lot to catch up on. There is lot. Kevin Rose: So much to catch up on and why don’t we just go back and forth and just have it be an old school Random Show where everything’s random, we have no idea we’re about to talk about. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s go for it. So, I’ll share an update on my side, which folks might find interesting. As you know and long-term listeners know, I have been one way you could put it as an early adopter looking at bioelectric medicine of different types, whether that is legitimate vagus nerve stimulation. By the way, there aren’t many options that would fall in that category, interviewing people like Dr. Kevin Tracey, but also looking at most acutely transcranial magnetic stimulation. So, TMS, which is a form of brain stimulation. I’ll keep it simple, that has existed for decades. But there was an innovation by the very recently late Nolan Williams, sadly, and others called accelerated TMS, where you basically take something like 50 stimulations, like 50 different sessions. And you compress it into one week, as opposed to doing it over the course of many months. And this type of dense dosing schedule produces some, in many people, incredible effects. And you saw me after my first experience of accelerated TMS, which was with a device called MagVenture device. It uses neuro targeting. So, you need a resting state fMRI and so on to determine where they’re actually going to place this stimulation depending on your condition and your own individual anatomy and activity. So, if it’s depression, they might point it in one direction or in one place. If it’s anxiety or OCD, they might point it somewhere else. And I effectively had, let’s just call it eight or nine out of 10, resting state generalized anxiety. Kevin Rose: Was this self-reported? Meaning, when you went in there to get the resting state scan, were you like, “Hey, I’m coming in here with ED and general anxiety, I need you to treat this for me.” And then they would — Tim Ferriss: Did you say ED? Kevin Rose: Yeah, yeah. I know it’s an issue, but oh, we can cut this if you want. We can cut this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, nice, nice. Very cute. Kevin Rose: No, but all the joking aside — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Kevin Rose: — how did you determine the areas? Did you have to tell them, this is what I’m coming in to treat, or is this something they see? Tim Ferriss: Well, they do interviews and assessments that are qualitative. Let’s just say asking you what your symptoms are, why are you coming here in the first place? Then they would dig into the details and then they would run you through various standardized tests or assessments. So, you might have the MADRS, you might have the HAM-D. You might have the Y-BOCS. They’re different assessments that are accepted as standardized for diagnosing, say OCD or any number of other psychiatric conditions. And then you get an fMRI. So, you get this scan of your brain, which I did at, I think it was Mass General in Massachusetts as you would guess. And based on that, they can do some precision targeting. And just to give people the upshot of that, I did five days of stimulations and that gave me basically three to four months of effectively a zero on a scale of zero to 10 of generalized anxiety. So, from that point forward, effectively, no anxiety. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: The rumination, the anxious mental loops that I would get involved with late at night, that would then in turn affect my sleep and cause onset insomnia, et cetera, that went to zero for a period of say, three to four months, which blew my mind. Kevin Rose: Just out of curiosity, were you tracking Oura data and whatnot, so you could see the impact of this as measured by different devices? Tim Ferriss: I wasn’t looking at Oura at that point in time. I have been tracking with Oura at least for the last three to four weeks. And so, I’m going to be taking a closer look at things like HRB and so on in terms of trending. But the upshot of it is that, and I’ll try to compress this a little bit. But that first time I did accelerated TMS, I had this incredible effect, much more durable in terms of its intensity of effect and relief than even any psychedelic therapy, or psychedelic assisted therapy that I’ve looked into. And those were effectively ended up being the two modalities with the greatest effect size on the psychiatric conditions that I was most personally interested in. And where I have funded a lot of early stage science. Unfortunately, when I then went to do boosters to do shorter duration, two or three days, nothing happened. So, my symptoms started creeping back in, which seemed to be hereditary. Just to put that out there, right? I recognize objectively, I’m like, “There isn’t really anything I should be so anxious about. I recognize that very clearly. Nonetheless, I get caught in these OCD/GAD, generalized anxiety disorder loops, and I see that in family members. So, it seems to be somewhat genetic. In any case, none of these boosters worked. And then I was like, “Fuck, this is terrible. Okay, well let me go back and do the full five days.” Full five days, didn’t do anything. And then I was looking back at the calendar and trying to identify anything that might have correlated, or preceded the first treatment that helped make it work. And I did see that I’d spent a few weeks in the Amazon maybe ending about two weeks prior to that treatment. So, since I was ingesting plants of various types that are known to induce some degree of neuroplasticity, I thought, well, it could be that it was a plasticity issue, a preconditioning that helped that first session. So, I tried to replicate that using psilocybin and did another five days, no effect, didn’t have any effect, and was starting to feel really hopeless about this. But then came across some research that this is going to sound pretty wild, and this is definitely early, early stages. So, to my knowledge, I’m maybe one out of fewer than a hundred people who have been one of the first monkeys shot in the space doing this specifically for anxiety. It has been applied to more people with depression, but decided to try simultaneous dosing with something called D-cycloserine (DCS). So, D-cycloserine, D-C-Y-C-L-O-S-E-R-I-N-E, is very, very interesting. So, it is an antibiotic that historically has been used to treat tuberculosis and urinary tract infections, but it is also now being studied. And for the last several years, people have been looking at this as a cognitive enhancer for treating various neuropsychiatric conditions. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Now, how they figured this out, I’m not sure. I mean, it could have been working backwards through the purported mechanism of action. So, D-cycloserine has been looked at in conjunction with say, CBT, like cognitive behavioral therapy and all sorts of different things. And part of what people believe makes it effective as an amplifier of effects, although there can be side effects and sometimes the pendulum swings the other direction is that it is a partial agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Now, ketamine also works on NMDA receptors, but it’s an antagonist. So, it’s very different in that respect. But I will again try to cut to the punchline. So, instead of doing five days, I did one day, just one day of basically a stimulation every hour on the hour for 10 hours and preloaded with a lozenge that you just let of melt in your mouth with this D-cycloserine, and it worked one day. It had some side effects. I had insomnia for about two weeks, which seems to happen in some patients who have undergone this. Some people have really bad insomnia for a month and then it goes away. And I was willing to take that risk. There’s some other things that can crop up, like temporary loss of some fine motor control and some other weird stuff. Kevin Rose: Oh, Jesus. Tim Ferriss: Tinnitus in some people. Kevin Rose: Wow, with just the treatment in general. Did the papers that you’re signing and say, this may happen? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, with any of this stuff, you’re writing your life away with some signatures. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s like frontier stuff. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, but the point that I’m trying to make here in a pretty long-winded way is number one, it worked. So, that leads me to believe that the original hypothesis that it was around neuroplasticity, so I needed to warm up the Play-Doh before it could be molded properly, could be accurate, right? That could be true. Secondly, and this is incredibly important, most people I know who are really busy, or most people who can’t afford it, can’t take five days off of work. They can’t take a week off of work to do this treatment no matter how bad their symptoms might be. And the fact that this D-cycloserine, like DCS enhanced treatment was able to be compressed into a single day, I feel like it opens up the multitude of people who can potentially use this tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, who knows? And it should also at the same time really decrease the cost. So, it’s made me even more bullish around accelerated TMS, and it’s been, I’d have to go back and look maybe a month, six weeks, but it’s still sticking, which is remarkable. So, in any case, for people who want to hear more, they can listen to my podcast with Nolan Williams that goes into a lot of detail around this, but very exciting stuff. It turns out a lot of these things might be interrelated and that certain types of TMS when implemented properly actually seem to also stimulate the vagus nerve in some interesting ways. So, this is the next frontier that I’m most interested in exploring right now is bioelectric medicine, right? So, computer chips over pills and so on. I think it allows you, in some respects to get much more targeted. So, that’s good news for me, but I think it’s also obviously at the edges of medicine right now. But I think that in the next two to three years, I could see this becoming a much more accessible therapeutic for millions of people. And there’s some companies you can watch. I mentioned one MagVenture or Magventures. The other is called Brainsway, and they’re actually a very small company, but publicly traded, and I’m sure there are going to be more entrants. So, super exciting stuff. But now I feel like I have a recipe worth trying to replicate where maybe once a quarter, maybe twice a year, depending on when — I think I see symptoms start to creep back in. I don’t think this is a one and done, nor is any psychedelic assisted therapy that I’m aware of. So, I expect it’ll be some type of ongoing treatment that I do one, two to four times per year. Kevin Rose: And when you think of the potential in one and inability to replicate this again in others, I know you put a lot of cash personally into philanthropic things around research and studies, are you curious to push on these buttons and see, can you put together a trial with 50 people and Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Kevin Rose: What’s your thoughts there? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I would definitely be interested in funding more research. The Brain Stimulation Lab at Stanford, I’ve already funded some research within. Very sadly, Nolan Williams, who helped develop a lot of these technologies died, I mean I want to say it was a month or two ago by suicide, very sadly. Kevin Rose: Oh, jeez. Tim Ferriss: And he was a friend and really heartbreaking to see. And I mean it’s hard to put that aside for the moment, but putting it aside for the moment, I did fund research within that lab. I suspect that’s going to take time to implement, particularly given the leadership vacuum that was created by his very, very tragic death. But I am interested in funding more research, and this is an ongoing thing. As you know, my foundation, the Saisei Foundation, has funded all sorts of on the edge research since 2015 or so, I would say. So, this is for sure where I would like to fund more research, particularly looking at these combinations. And that could be something like these, like a D-cycloserine plus stimulation. And at certain clinics, they have cohorts of say 60 — I think it’s at the time that I did it, there were 60 patients who had been treated for some form of anxiety disorder with this combination. I think that at least at that particular clinic on the depression side, the numbers are larger, probably 200 or so. But it’s exciting, it’s exciting. I mean that’s enough to get a signal, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And sure, you need to check all the boxes and do the randomized placebo controlled studies with multiple arms and all that, but it is enough to start to see a signal, especially when you have treatment resistant cases that haven’t responded to other things. And that’s enough to inform at least the design of a study that would take much longer. So, we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: But I will say that much some people experience with GLP-1 agonists like Tirzepatide, and Mounjaro or Ozempic or whatever, after these treatments and maybe it’s just from really putting the brakes on a lot of the OCD like circuitry, that I had much less desire to over consume caffeine, to over consume alcohol. It made dialing all of those things back a lot easier, which has been — Kevin Rose: And you know that’s a massive benefit of GLP-1s for a lot of people? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which is huge. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Well, dude, I’m pumped for you, man. It’s like I love to see you getting some relief here, even if just for a few months, and that’s fantastic, it’s repeatable. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. So, fingers crossed. We’ll see. And for people who want to learn more, I would suggest they start with, as eerie as it might be, my conversation on the podcast with Nolan Williams. All right, man, you’re up. What’s next? Kevin Rose: Speaking of brain-related things, I was out a dinner with a friend and I was lamenting in talking about just my inability to remember faces, names, and then how that extended into childhood for me, which was doing poorly on tests and just I couldn’t quite retain the information the way that my friends could. I just could never explain it. Somebody at dinner, my buddy Mau said to me, “Do you have aphantasia?” And I said, “I have no idea what that is.” And then he said, “Okay, I want you to close your eyes right now,” and this is going to blow some people’s minds right now. “Close your eyes and picture an apple in your mind’s eye. Picture an apple. What do you see? Do you see a red apple? Do you see water droplets on it? Does it look fresh? Does it look like an HD image?” And that’s what he said to me. I go, “What are you talking about?” And he goes, “Well, what does it look like to you?” And I go, “There’s no apple.” He goes, “What do you mean there’s no apple?” And I said, “Well, there’s like an outline, ghosty foggy thing, maybe-ish.” And he goes, “Oh, you have aphantasia.” And I was immediately jumped, whatever, ChatGPT. And I had no idea that people suffer from this condition and it’s in the low single digit percentage of people, and they have no idea that this is a thing where you cannot picture something in your mind’s eye. Had you heard of this before or no? Tim Ferriss: No, I hadn’t until you dropped it in one of our group friend text threads. This was, I guess a couple of weeks ago. But Fantasia is spelled like the Disney movie, but actually no, that would be with an F. It’s aphantasia, A-P-H-A-N-T-A-S-I-A, yeah, is the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images first described in 1880. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: When you close your eyes, what do you see? Because they give you a scale there, and a five is like an HD full on, beautiful apple. What do you see? Do you see a perfect quality apple? Tim Ferriss: So aphantasia can be considered the opposite of hyperphantasia. I am the exact opposite. I have hyper-visual recall and the ability — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — to visualize. So I can probably draw the vast majority of restaurants or the floor plans that I’ve ever visited, right? I can absolutely spec it out and have very, very vivid visualization. So I would be on the far other end of the spectrum. Kevin Rose: So when you think of a new idea, do you see it in some ways? Because I feel it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You are very similar to my friend Mike, because I remember Mike and I have a lot of shared flight time with psychedelic experiences, and he was describing how he has almost no visual imagery, and it’s almost purely kinesthetic for him. And that is as hard for me to imagine as it is for him to imagine my experience, which is overwhelmingly explosively visual. Kevin Rose: What’s crazy, dude, is how many things I think I thought were jokes. When people said they counted sheep before they went to bed. I was like, “Oh, that’s funny. Would you count numbers in your head?” But I didn’t know they see sheep. I didn’t know. And if you’re younger, mute the podcast for 10 seconds, I didn’t know the spank bank was a real bank you could visit. I thought I didn’t even know that was a thing. I seriously didn’t — Tim Ferriss: Well, to be clear, it’s not a bank with tellers and — Kevin Rose: No, but it is in your head. Tim Ferriss: — safety security boxes. Kevin Rose: It’s in your head. You can open up the box and go back and see that. I can’t see any of that. It sucks. My buddy from Diggnation Podcast was like, after we stopped recording, he’s like, “”You’ve got to be kidding me. So, you can’t go back and look at people you’ve dated in the past during intimate moments and see, revisualize that?” I’m like, “No, I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And he goes, “Oh, yeah.” He’s like, “Oh,” he felt so bad for me. He was almost starting to cry for me. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Tim Ferriss: What do you think you have, if anything, developed in compensation of that? Kevin Rose: Well, the one thing that I have never been able to explain is that the feeling side of it, everything is that everything is a feeling. So I have a friend of mine, and I’m not this way, but she composes music and she said that she sees in her head music is represented as colors. And so, when I come up with ideas for projects, I’m not seeing something. I’m traversing a feeling of a path, rather than a visual thing. It’s funny you mentioned the fear of flying. I think part of the reason why I have such a vivid fear of flying is that feeling comes so strong of the plane crashing, not that I see the plane crashing. So, it’s just a different thing, but I wouldn’t trade that for the world. That has served me quite well in investing and seeing around corners early and things of that nature. But when I explain that to people, you feel a new idea. There’s been a bunch of people that have no idea what I’m talking about and something they can’t. I think you can probably have both, but new ideas come from this rising of feeling, not visual, if that makes sense. Tim Ferriss: Wild. I mean, it doesn’t really make sense to me, but it would make sense to my friend Mike. And thinking about all this and hearing about your friend who I think you said sees musical notes as colors, that’s often referred to as synesthesia. And there’s a really amazing little book that I read ages ago. It’s been around for a long time. I’m looking at it right now. It was published in 1987, but it’s 192 pages. Anyone who’s interested in memory and mind and the vast differences between people might be interested in this, it’s called The Mind of a Mnemonist, I think is how it’s pronounced, like mnemonic device, M-N-E-M-O-N-I-S-T, a little book about a vast memory. The author’s name is A.R. Those are initials, A.R. Luria, L-U-R-I-A. And here the description’s very short, so I’ll just read it. “This study explores the inner world of a rare human phenomenon — a man who was endowed with virtually limitless powers of memory. From his intimate knowledge of S., the mnemonist, gained from conversations and testing over a period of almost thirty years, A.R. Luria is able to reveal in rich detail not only the obvious strengths of S.’s astonishing memory but also his surprising weaknesses: his crippling inability to forget, his pattern of reacting passively to life, and his uniquely handicapped personality.” Fascinating, fascinating book that I really recommend to people, but aphantasia, who knew? Kevin Rose: You know who I should talk to is Joshua Waitzkin, because didn’t he say that he feels chess? And for people that don’t know, he was the guy that was based on the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, Searching for Bobby Fischer was originally a book and then a movie, which was based on the childhood chess prodigy chapters of Josh Waitzkin’s life. And Josh hates that term prodigy. He has some unusual hardware to be sure, but he also has a really incredible framework that he’s applied to now four or five different fields to become world-class in all of them. But he does have a feeling about certain things. One of the stories that he has told me is he was playing a simul, which means he was playing, I don’t know what the number was, 30 or 20 to 40 people simultaneously where he is walking around a room and playing — Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, you do it really fast, right? You just look and then move. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, he’s just moving from table to table really quickly, and I think was with some very high level high school players, something like that. Maybe they were younger, I can’t recall. But he was going around, he’s playing 20 or 30 simultaneous games in his head. And then at one point, he explained it as it feels like you’re juggling 20 or 30 balls in the air. And then he got to one table and he felt all the balls come crashing to the ground. Kevin Rose: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And he said, it felt as though I just missed a ball, and they’d all fallen on the ground, and he couldn’t quite figure out why that was the case. And then he was able to deduce that one of the kids had cheated, one of the kids had moved a piece. Kevin Rose: Oh, no way. Tim Ferriss: And it was just a gut feeling. And then that visual that allowed him to figure out which of the kids had cheated. It’s just insane. Kevin Rose: Holy shit. Tim Ferriss: That people can even do that. Yeah, yeah. Josh. Yeah, if you want to listen to Joshua Waitzkin’s first ever podcast, you were podcast episode number one, and he was podcast episode number two, if I remember correctly. Kevin Rose: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Wild character. Oh, man. Let’s see. Kevin Rose: All right, you’re up. Tim Ferriss: I’m up. Well, I’ll give another medical one that I think is interesting. And I’ve been texting and interacting with Matt Walker a lot on this. Matt is a scientist. He wrote a book, Why We Sleep, and is about as credible as you can be within the world of sleep science and — Kevin Rose: He’s the best. And he’s a great human. Tim Ferriss: He’s a great guy. Kevin Rose: Fantastic human. Tim Ferriss: Great guy, has the most pleasing dulcet tones with that British accent and kind lilt in the voice. Kevin Rose: Plus 10 IQ accent, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Plus 10 or 20 IQ points with the accent. But his podcast is also excellent, and we can link to it in the show notes, but he did an episode on a class of sleep medication called DORAs and DORA stands for dual orexin receptor antagonists. And the reason that DORAs became very interesting to me is that I have Alzheimer’s in my family, and it’s left right and center for me right now because I have three relatives currently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and I — Kevin Rose: Holy shit. That’s your APOE e4 negative folks? Tim Ferriss: It includes APOE e4 negative folks. So, we won’t get too far into the genetics, but people who should not be, based on that particular parameter, should not be particularly inclined to Alzheimer’s, nonetheless have Alzheimer’s. And then there are of course people who have three, four, I don’t think any of them are APOE e33, I am APOE e34. So, compared to a 33 that, at least, as I understand it would predispose me and say 2.5 times. Kevin Rose: You and my wife and Rhonda Patrick, and Attia, too, actually is a 34. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there you go. Kevin Rose: All of you guys. I’m the only one that’s not. Crazy. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, in effect, to our current understanding, you want to mitigate the accumulation of two things, is one is beta amyloid plaque, another is tangles that are created by tau proteins. And sleep is really imperative for this. And if you have sleep issues as I have for decades, the onset insomnia, low percentage of deep sleep, et cetera, you’re effectively unable to have your garbage service within the brain clear out these at a rate that offsets the accumulation. Kevin Rose: But we don’t know if these are causal, right? There’s never been any conclusion whether these are causal. They’re most likely the protective effects of something else gone awry. Do you agree with that? Tim Ferriss: I would say that, based on our best understanding, if you can mitigate the accumulation of these things, there seems to be, at the very least, delaying of the progression of these diseases. And there are different drugs and fusions like Donanemab and so on that are predicated on that understanding of the mechanism. This is still early days in the world of Alzheimer’s, but it seems very defensible with our understanding currently that the less of this stuff you accumulate, the better off you are. Kevin Rose: Do you follow Dale Bredesen’s work, by the way? Tim Ferriss: I don’t. Let’s come back to that. Kevin Rose: Okay. Tim Ferriss: Let me just quickly tie this up and say that an example of a DORA would be Belsomra. There are many others, or I should say a handful of others, but I have taken as I believe you have — well, actually no, it was too strong for you, but — Kevin Rose: I gave you some, dude. Tim Ferriss: Well, yeah, that’s right. You gave me the Belsomra. Kevin Rose: I gave you a bunch of Belsomra and you were going to give me some other shit back and you never gave me anything good. Tim Ferriss: Well, hold on, hold on. That’s still pending, but let me come back. So, you gave me the Belsomra, but I said using it, I was going to get it on a prescription. It’s expensive as fuck. Kevin Rose: Yeah, I paid a shit-ton for it, and then I didn’t use it. Tim Ferriss: And I was like, all right, I’ll take your Belsomra. But the Trazodone, I got off of Trazodone and switched as a sleep medication to, in this case, Belsomra, because it was literally down the street in an Uber at your house, not recommending you use your friend’s bootleg drugs, by the way, talk to your doctor, but — Kevin Rose: We also have physicians that are looking at all our shit, so it’s not — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, right. But I have been, now, on Belsomra for a few months as hopefully a — it’s too strong to say it’s a preventative strategy, but at least a delay strategy for potentially Alzheimer’s and other associated neurodegenerative conditions. So, I would encourage people, and I’ll link to this in the show notes, to check out Matt Walker’s podcast on this specifically. Kevin Rose: You know what they did with Belsomra where they tap the spines of people that took it and they noticed there were less tau, the proteins in the spinal fluid? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they cleared a lot more. I mean, I think it was they looked at animal models and then they looked at humans. And in that podcast episode also, Matt discusses data related to comparing, say Belsomra or I should say DORAs to Ambien, right? And not all sleep medications are created equal. A lot of sleep medications effectively sedate you. But in the case of DORAs, orexin, as I understand it, is a wakefulness. Hmm, I think it’s a hormone, but this is effectively inhibiting wakefulness as opposed to sedating. And by using that particular approach, you’re able to create more naturalistic sleep. So it’s preserving sleep architecture, increasing certain things like REM sleep. In any case, it’s very interesting because as it stands, look, sure, like exercise for a natural release of cloth, watch your diet, blah, blah, blah. There are a handful of things here. Sleep, super critically important if we’re talking about, again, staving off, hopefully neurodegenerative disease, but there really just aren’t that many tools in the toolkit. So, to come across some of this data via Matt Walker was very eye-opening to me. So, that’s — Kevin Rose: That’s awesome. Tim Ferriss: That’s also something that I’m looking at really closely. Kevin Rose: I will say the scariest test I have done in my life was about three months ago. I went and had my blood work done and had the towel, the full on, you can check your blood now to see if you are producing, or we’re always producing it, but if you’re out of bounds, meaning you’re above the norm in your production of these types of proteins. And if you are, it’s like 99 percent chance you’re on the path to some form of dementia, right? And did you do that test? Tim Ferriss: I have just done a whole battery of different tests. And — Kevin Rose: Did you do the p-tau one though? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m going to have all that stuff. So, I will — Kevin Rose: It’s scary, dude. You come hang with me, we’ll have a drink or something. Tim Ferriss: I’m looking at all my results in probably two or three weeks because I have a few online batteries that I’m going to do assessments. Kevin Rose: It is absolutely terrifying because the doctor was like, “Hey, do you want to do this? I have this available.” And I was like, “Sure, go ahead.” And then three days afterwards, I’m like, “I should look up what that test is all about.” And there’s three of them now that can detect these various proteins that are essentially, if you have elevated levels, you’re on marching orders or you’re heading towards some type of dementia. And I realized that and I was like, “Wow, if this comes back positive, this is an emergency situation where high intensity interval training every single morning for an hour. There’s a lot of things you have to get into.” And it’s a very frightening thing. It’s a very frightening thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it can be super frightening. And there’s certain other things that I think are just holistically good for my particular goals, cognitive, psychological, physical, like the ketogenic diet. I recently did a podcast with David Baszucki, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, and he and his wife have a foundation that it is the largest funder of science related to metabolic therapies with a particular focus on ketogenic therapy. So, I will be doing all of December in ketosis as an example. Kevin Rose: Oh, that’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, just to keep that metabolic machinery humming because I do think it’s plausible that it could help longterm with a lot of the stuff we’re talking about. Kevin Rose: So, Tim, real quick, just to put a bow on this, Dale. Yeah, so the reason I like Dale, Dale’s a scientist that studies all forms of dementia. He has a book called The End of Alzheimer’s. You’ve probably heard of that book. It’s pretty popular. Tim Ferriss: I’ve come across his name. Yeah. Kevin Rose: He’s a little bit different than most of the scientists out there where he believes that Alzheimer’s and these other dementias, they’re not just a one size fits all, one thing went wrong, but it can be a suite of different things that go wrong that lead you down this path. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: And so, it’s metabolic disorder, it’s potential toxins. I think he’s like the four major contributors to different various forms of dementia. And he’s developed this protocol that can stabilize and even reverse a lot of this early cognitive decline if you catch it early enough. And it’s a little bit of throwing the whole kitchen sink at it because it’s everything. And he’s not quite sure exactly what is doing in the fix here, but it’s fascinating, the research that he’s done, two things that stood out to me that he recommends is one, getting this p-tau test done on the blood front and then also recommends the ketogenic diet. And this ketogenic diet is huge for people. And he’s seen that alone stabilize people from mental decline. And not that they’re not eventually going to get it, but the point is, do you want to go into full decline within five years or do you want it to be 15 years, right? And so, that’s what his lab’s focused on. Tim Ferriss: Cool. Yeah, I’ll check him out. I mean I’ve seen, not that this is a necessarily sustainable or scalable approach, but with some of my relatives with Alzheimer’s where it’s pretty progressed and they tend to give one word answers or get confused and give the wrong answer to questions, giving them, say, 35 milliliters of exogenous ketones. So, they’re not in ketosis, they’re following the terrible diet they’ve always followed, but give them 35 milliliters of high octane exogenous ketones before going for a walk. And within 30 minutes, they’re speaking in full sentences. I mean, you see some really wild temporary, but nonetheless, very interesting transformations, which comes back to what you said about metabolic syndrome. And there are good reasons why some folks refer to Alzheimer’s as type three diabetes, right? Kevin Rose: A hundred percent. And that’s what he says in his book. He’s like, that is definitely a contributor, like excess blood glucose levels and all the downstream inflammation effects that come from that. It’s Bad News Bears, as you like to say. That’s Tim Ferriss is — Tim Ferriss: Bad News Bears. All right, Kevin, what have you got? Kevin Rose: I wanted to give people a quick little update on the State of the Union around all things AI. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, please. I could use it too. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s just such a fascinating time in that every, I’d call it four to eight weeks, maybe a slight bit longer, sometimes less so, we’re seeing leapfrogs in what is possible. And one of the things that I would caution people against is forming an opinion about AI and then locking yourself in time around that opinion. I’ll give you a great practical example. I have a lot of engineers that said, “Hey, I tried AI for coding. It was horrible. My first question is, when did you try it? And they said, “Oh, three months ago.” And I’m like, “No, no, you don’t understand. It’s three to four times better than it was three months ago,” right? And so, we have to make sure that even if you are looking at some of these technologies and say, “Hey, it can’t do X or it’s horrible, it’s hallucinating in this way. It’s giving me the wrong answer. This is without a doubt the massive Motorola block phone version of the iPhone.” We are in that realm of AI, the very first innings of it all and every few months. I mean even Opus four or five came out three, four days ago, whatever, it’s a means — Tim Ferriss: Explain what that is. Kevin Rose: Okay, so when you think about frontier models, meaning do you have the bigs Anthropic, you’ve got Google, you’ve OpenAI, OpenAI, and then I’d throw a couple others in there, Meta’s trying in some sense and perplexity and whatnot. But when you think about the big massive models that are running that are at the bleeding edge of all this, meaning they’re the best of the best, the most expensive per query, what happens is they have to train these data sets and then they go in and they eventually release a model, right? And these are typically marked by software versioning numbers know ChatGPT 3 versus ChatGPT 4 versus ChatGPT 5, and then they’ll do 51, 52 or 41, 42 or whatever. So, it’s like software kind of versioning on these models. And whenever you see a new release, you’re talking a jump in terms of both sometimes the capacity to understand information, and they call that the token context windows. And then also their just natural built-in abilities of the things that they can do well. And so, some things they can do at a graduate level now, some things they can do, their novel ideas is still pretty low down the chain in terms of what they can do around original thinking. But they have all these benchmarks, so they have probably 15 or 20 different benchmarks that they run it against. Can it complete the bar exam is one, right? And so, now they’re able to do it, and then now the question is how quickly can they do it in? It would take them 25 minutes before now it’s five minutes. So, then there’s a bunch of inference side of benchmarking as well. So, we’re seeing Gemini 3 came out just a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic. And I will say that I called NVIDIA on here way back in the day. It was 1.8 trillion I think back in the day when I said, “Hey, I think this is going to run, when you and I were talking about it,” and it did because I knew GPUs were just going to be the most precious commodity we have as technologists. I have seen that Google now is in the driver’s seat here and I’m really excited for them because one, I worked at Google, they acquired one of my companies and I spent a few years there. And I’ve seen inside the belly of the, and I will tell you that they were built for this day and age, the fact that they’ve been training their entire life for this moment. They have all of the PhDs and all of the folks that they need to go pull this off across the entire suite. And so, what do I mean by the entire suite? And this is where it gets really interesting, Tim. If you think about what OpenAI has to do to compete, they have to go and buy up as much data center space as possible, and they have to buy a shit ton of GPUs from NVIDIA. That’s what they need because they don’t own the stack. They own the software, the training, the engineering, the soft good side of the business, but they don’t own the hardware side. This is a fantastic, really interesting stat. When Gemini three came out a couple weeks ago, it was the first time they had trained a frontier model. The best of best when it dropped, it was the best model in the world exclusively on Google chips. So, they have these chips called TPUs, tensor processing units. They have the full stack dude, they don’t even need NVIDIA. It’s wild. They didn’t use an NVIDIA chip to train their AI and they have world-class AI. So, it’s just really exciting. This is such a fun time to be alive because right now, you can take someone that is a technologist in the sense that they have a rough understanding of the available tech that’s out there, and you could build and produce and ship any app that you want within a few days now with what we have, and it’s just going to get better and better. So, the creativity and the shipping unlockments that we’re about to see over the next five years is going to be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. If you have the idea for an app or a product or service, anything digital, you will be able to take it from ideation and drawing it on a piece of paper to actual shipping something to your customers within, call it less than a week, which is just never been done before at a price that is, I don’t know, $500, right? And so, if Tim wanted his own app five years ago, I’d have been like, “Okay, great. You want the Tim Ferriss fan site/ed help app, then to build that would be 50 grand,” right? Tim Ferriss: I feel like you have a problem that we need to talk about. You’re just bringing it up so much. After that half a glass of champagne, I feel like — Kevin Rose: It went straight to my head, number one and number two — Tim Ferriss: Turning into a mini confessional here. Kevin Rose: We need to talk about your relationships because one of the things that whenever I get on — Tim Ferriss: Oh, boy. Kevin Rose: No, I’m telling you whenever we do a Random Show, people are always like, they send me messages and they’re like, “I love how you give him shit, number one, and number two, we want to hear more about his personal life.” And I know you’ve got a new special someone in your life, which I’m very excited for. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that. Yeah, nice segue. Kevin Rose: Let’s jump into that. Now that we’ve covered Google, let’s jump into your personal life. Tim Ferriss: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I want to ask you for a counterpoint on a previous, I wouldn’t call it necessarily a prediction, but we talked about, I think it was in the last episode of The Random Show, a bit about venture capital. And I wouldn’t say that you said across the board, venture capital would be dead because there are capital intensive businesses that require — Kevin Rose: Yeah, hardware. Tim Ferriss: — hardware and build out and wet labs and all this stuff. But I’m wondering if I just put on my future vision goggles, which I wish I had, but let’s just pretend I do and I look forward, it doesn’t need to be five years. I look forward two years. And what you are describing is a reality, right? The barrier to entry, the hurdle is so low that suddenly from ideation to product takes a week. And there is an absolute glut, this just overwhelming tsunami of products. Now, on the positive side, yes, what would’ve cost people millions and millions of dollars to do 10 years ago, let’s say, 15 years ago, suddenly AWS and rentable infrastructure comes along, that cost goes down. Now AI comes along, cost further goes down. Kevin Rose: Sure. Tim Ferriss: But I imagine the war for attention is going to get so incredibly expensive. Do you think that products that get traction will nonetheless, if they don’t have the income stream to support it, raise venture capital purely for a marketing war chest and customer acquisition? I’m just wondering if you think you could make the argument that the customer acquisition costs are going to get, or user acquisition costs are going to get so high because everyone, you’re going to have a hundred X the number of bidders now who knows what the form will be. I don’t know if it’ll be Google AdWords, maybe it’ll be something else. What are your thoughts? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think, well, there’s a couple things there. The best products I’ve ever invested in, period, full stop, have been ones that don’t rely upon paid acquisition to grow. So, they have come up with something that is unique and novel enough to where word of mouth is their number one driver. That said, capital and deployed the right way and spent the right way around. Ad purchases is just fuel for the fire, which is great. And so, the thing VC is dead in the sense that the seed round was like, “Okay, I have a idea-ish. I’m going to go out and take $3 million and I’m going to give away 20 percent of my company.” What happens in the future is not that you don’t need that capital, because I think you’re right. You will need it for a variety of things. If you’re hitting insane scale, there will be moments where you need to put more warm bodies in seats to help you do all the things, and you may need to raise venture. But the difference is when you have product market fit, you go from raising and selling 20 percent of your business for $3 million to selling 20 percent of your business for $15 million, which is just fantastic for the entrepreneur. So, it’s not that venture is dead, it’s just that what we’re going to see is the entrepreneur is in control like they’ve never been before, which is fantastic. And if they say, “Okay, I’m off to the races and things are going so well, but guess what? I’m actually charging for my product and I’m breakeven.” You don’t ever have to raise VC. And then now you own a hundred percent of the business and you’re a Jason Fried, which we know is one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs of our time that invented SaaS that just has never taken any external investment. And you are just happy and you don’t report to anyone, which is a beautiful thing as well. Tim Ferriss: So, do you think it’s just like the killing fields for early stage folks and the value capture just gets pushed to later and later stage. Kevin Rose: Pushed out. Tim Ferriss: Right? Kevin Rose: Yeah, I think that’s right. And I think largely on just tech, that is it’s understandable by AI. Meaning, if you’re running TypeScript or any of these languages that AI can figure out and write high quality code for, you just don’t need to raise capital. You can do it nights and weekends on your own. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Amazing. Okay. So, is it fair to say if you had to bet on one horse in the AI race that you would bet on Google? And then I have a follow-up question. Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: Well, now I know a little bit too much behind the scenes. If you had no stake in any companies, how would you please — Kevin Rose: Well, I never answer like that. I would always give you the true answer, even if I didn’t — Tim Ferriss: No, I know. I’ve got to say it, but yeah, where would you put first, second, third bet? Kevin Rose: Honestly, these valuations, I wouldn’t put a single dollar into the top three or five, largely because what are you going to do? Is Google going to 3X in the next 10 years? Tim Ferriss: Well, also, it remains to be seen how much AI cannibalizes their current money-printing machine in terms of search and sponsored ads and so on. Kevin Rose: I’m less worried about that because they own the largest distribution platform on Earth, which is Android. And so, they will find a way in there. And then also I think if Google had to pick their poison and say, “Okay, you can either base the future business off a $25 a month pro subscription to Gemini or a free account that is just ad-driven,” I think they’ll take that hybrid model all day long. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good point. Interesting. Okay, so you wouldn’t put any money into the big ones. So, do you choose then? Are you trying to find Amazon in 1998, 1999, right? Just in the absolute noise of — AI slop doesn’t just apply to Sora, it also applies to startups, right? There’s so much bullshit floating around. Some of it’s dressed up in very fancy clothing with fancy names, right? So, if you’re investing in AI writ large, how do you even — I mean, this is your job, right? Kevin Rose: I think there’s three buckets. I think there’s three buckets. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I have to think about it. Kevin Rose: One is power. Without a doubt, we’re all going to need power. Small nuclear reactors are going to be a thing. The United States needs 3 to 5Xs power capacity in the next decade, if not more. And there is going to be a huge push into energy. So, there’s a bunch of plays there. You can look them up. There are even ETFs that track bundles of nuclear-related companies that are out there. That’s one play. I think power is without a doubt, the most important piece of this. And then data centers. There’s publicly traded data center companies out there. There are the bigs like Microsoft and Google and Amazon that are just expanding as fast as they possibly can and buying up land all over the United States. There’re always going to be a premium on that. They’re going to need that. NVIDIA, they’ve got competition from AMD, they’ve got competition from Google now. Obviously, they have such incredible tooling on the software side, there’s a lot of defensibility there. It’s a name to own. Would I buy in today at today’s prices? I don’t know. But I will say that if you think of this, less about, I’m just going to pick one horse and more like I’m going to pick a basket of things, these are the things that I would be putting into that basket. And then lastly, I would take large companies that have insane bloat from headcount that can be automated in the next, call it two to three years, where they will reduce sadly, and I hate to see this happen, but it’s going to happen no matter what. They’re going to reduce their headcount. They’re going to automate with AI and their profit margins are going to go through the roof. And I think those companies will reap the benefits of efficiency that comes from AI and their stock prices will as well. Tim Ferriss: How do you identify companies that have the most bloat with also the fewest hurdles to adopting AI for what you’re describing, right? Because some of them, they may be, who knows, just put in a position where from a process or regulatory perspective or whatever, they just can’t do it, at least in the near term. Kevin Rose: Yeah, in the near term, it’s listening to earnings calls and it is, I want to hear the CEO e saying that they are absolutely forcing their engineers to use AI forcing. You have to be, it is not optional at this point. To ask your engineers to play with it, you have to be using it every single day in your workflow. And the folks that are doing that, even though it’s not perfect today, they’re going to reap all the benefits 12 to 18 months from now. And so, that’s what I’m looking for more than anything else is who is wise enough? Because a lot of the CEOs are old. Who is wise enough to say it’s true, we know these folks and they just don’t — If you ask them the difference between Haiku 4, 5, and Sonnet, they would have no idea how to tell you. If they can’t answer those basic model related questions, what are you doing? So, it’s finding those people like the Jack Dorseys in the world and the folks that are just like — well, I wouldn’t want to say young because I want to be Asian, but they have to be leaning into this in a way that they have to believe that their entire business is going to be rebuilt from the ground up over the next, call it five years. And you have people like Salesforce, CEOs doing that. Obviously, Benioff’s on board with this. There’s a handful of folks that have said, “We are making sure this is a mandate from the top down.” Google did this quite well where they had this red alarm, or thing that they called off probably three years ago, where it said it is all hands on deck AI and Apple did not do that. And now look what’s happening. Most likely, Apple’s going to end up licensing Gemini from Google. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Wild world out there, kids. Wild world. Kevin Rose: Yeah. It’s a fun time to be alive, man. It’s fun to be playing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. Let’s see. I figure I could give people some maybe holiday gift ideas just in case they’re — Kevin Rose: Oh, yes, I’ve got some great ones. First thing I can recommend, something you can fit in your pocket. So, this right here looks like a golf ball with little, not quite spikes, but studs on it. They’re flattened. This is called a Rubz ball, R-U-B-Z, and I travel with this. You just roll out your feet on this before you go to bed and I have felt this helped everything from relaxing and just winding down. What I have noticed, and this is something I spoke with Ed Coan about a hundred years ago, long time ago. He’s the greatest powerlifter of all time, phenomenal athlete and very nice guy. But basically if you address your feet, sometimes you feel it all the way up the kinetic chain, your forelegs, knees, even your low back can sometimes release. So this, I think it cost less than 10 bucks. This is a Rubz ball. You can buy it on Amazon anywhere else. That’s a very easy one. That’s just pocket sized. We can go back and forth. What have you got? What you — Kevin Rose: Yeah, let’s do it. Okay, so this one is awesome, dude. You have my doc that I sent you right with the links to everything? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I do. Kevin Rose: I don’t know if you have it up in front of you. So, if you click on the second one down these bonsai Nanoblocks. So, I’ve been talking about Nanoblocks for a while. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you are. Kevin Rose: Hear me out, dude. This is a fun stocking stuffer. People are going to love this shit. So, it’s $38. It’s these little baby bonsai trees. Nanoblocks are like LEGOs, but they’re like one 10th of the size. So, you need tweezers to assemble them. It is oddly satisfying to build these little tiny bonsai trees. You get all six of them for $38 and if you use the code, Tim — no, there’s no code, but they’re amazing. They’re so fun. Anyway, Nanoblocks are awesome. This is a little fun little pack, great stocking stuffer. They’re super tiny and they’re cute. Look, there’s Nanoblocks up there behind me. See that beautiful tree? Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. There it is. So you recommended a book to me. Do you want to mention it? It’s last in your list. I bought the audiobook and I listened to it on my flights recently. I thought the narrator was really, really good also. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s called Stop Fixing Yourself: Wake Up, All Is Well. It’s by Anthony De Mello, who we were talking about the Jesuit priest and therapist that we talked about earlier. Tim, we had both somehow discovered this book originally. Not this book, but the other one we’re talking about. Tim Ferriss: Awareness. Kevin Rose: Awareness. And it was really cool to hear that you were into it because it was one of my favorite books that we did not compare notes and we read this independently. I don’t know how the hell that happened, but we both loved it. And this is another one where I was just like, “This is so good because there’s so many core truths here that apply to my practice on the meditation side and I just loved it.” But it does require a little bit of understanding. It’s not like someone from off the street can totally read this and be like, “Oh, that makes a ton of sense to me.” I don’t know if you felt that way. Tim Ferriss: I feel like, well, there are two things I would say. Just having read a lot of Anthony De Mello that I think Awareness, subtitle, Conversations with the Masters, it used to be The Perils and Promise of Reality, but they changed the subtitle. I preferred the old one, but Awareness by Anthony De Mello. His last name is two words, D-E M-E-L-L-O is 184 pages and I’ve gifted it to at least 50 people. I mean, I have an entire bookshelf full of this book in my guest bedroom at my house just to give friends. Kevin Rose: Yeah, same, dude. It’s so funny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I would recommend people read Awareness first. I don’t think you need anything special in terms of background for that. Kevin Rose: Well, you do need one thing. You need to know that it is a lecture, so it reads like a lecture. It doesn’t read like a book. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, which I like, which I like and he’s very no-nonsense. Kevin Rose: I gave it to a couple of friends and they started reading it and they’re like, “Wait, is this a talk that he gave?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, yeah, I should have told you that. It’s an actual talk.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s a collection of polished lectures that he gave. So, Awareness would be the first. And then in the case of the Stop Fixing Yourself, I really enjoyed it. There’s a lot of overlap with Awareness. So, there are certain points that get reiterated. The audiobook rendition of Stop Fixing Yourself is very, very good. I disagree with some of the conclusions which are effectively along the lines — I shouldn’t say, this might sound unfair, but in the conclusion, he talks about how ultimate freedom is not depending on anyone for anything and you could be perfectly happy in isolation by yourself. And I was like, “Evolutionarily. I think that’s actually a pretty hard sell.” But what I would suggest is if you listen to or read these books, as with any book, expect that you’re going to disagree with and maybe even discard 10 percent, 20 percent of it, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. These are really, really helpful books. Kevin Rose: Well said. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, let me grab another one here. I’ll recommend two others in case people are interested in books. So, fiction, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. I think it might just be Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. Anyway, it’s tomorrow three times by Gabrielle Zevin, Z-E-V-I-N. It’s a fiction book and it was on the New York Times’ list of the hundred best books of the 21st century. It’s a new one and it is all about entrepreneurship and game design and love unrequited. And when I recommended this book initially in 5-Bullet Friday, my newsletter, one of my attorneys who helped craft the agreement for Coyote, another stocking stuffer, the card game that I made which is 20 — Kevin Rose: Yeah, I know this is on a Black Friday sale, by the way, it’s 38 percent off on Amazon right now or something like that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s 7.99 right now. It’s doing super well there. The reviews are great. It’s like 4.7 or 4.8 stars. Kevin Rose: Man, I’m so proud of you, dude. This is so cool to see you having success here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, thanks man. Kevin Rose: I thought you were going to do The 5-Hour Body and I was like, “Ah, you probably shouldn’t go there,” and it’s nice to see you doing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, it’s been super fun. But my attorney, who helped with the negotiations on deal structuring for Coyote, specializes in video games and he’s been involved with some epic deals and amazing mergers and acquisitions and all this crazy stuff. And he texted me after I put that in the newsletter and he said, “That book is so good. It was eerie because it is so accurate down to the finest detail that it felt like somebody was looking over my shoulder when I was doing these deals.” That is how well researched this book is. You would love it. I really think you would enjoy it. Kevin Rose: My old assistant, Sarah, who’s amazing, she gifted it to me and it burned in the fire when my house burned down. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ve got to read it. Kevin Rose: But I need to get it because she was like, “You’ve got to listen to this book.” Tim Ferriss: Oh, it’s so good. Yeah, it’s great. And then the last one I’ll recommend just because we gave some nonfiction, then just gave fiction. I’ll give poetry, which people might not expect, but it’s a little tiny compilation. This also has an entire shelf in my guest room. It’s called Gold, it’s by Rumi. And then the translator, Haleh Liza Gafori, last name G-A-F-O-R-I, 112 pages. And it is just an incredible collection of poetry, of course, originally by the great Persian mystic Rumi, but with incredible new translations by Haleh Liza Gafori, who is an American poet of Persian descent. So, she’s a native speaker and also, she herself a poet and musician. So, if you read one or two of these poems before you go to bed at night, it just makes everything better. So I would also just recommend. I can keep going with gift recommendations, but I suspect you have more. I would like to mention anymore. Kevin Rose: Oh, I’ve got some great ones, dude. Yeah, absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t we do two at a time? Why don’t you do two and then I’ll do another two. Kevin Rose: Okay. I’m going to make you a multi-billionaire from how many people buy this next one, I’m going to say with your Amazon affiliate link. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Kevin Rose: This right here, my friend, is the best purchase I’ve ever made in my life. Tim Ferriss: Whoa, that’s a strong statement. Kevin Rose: Okay, maybe not, but it’s high up there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, okay. Kevin Rose: Have you ever been in one of those situations where you need a small, little screwdriver or a screw head and you can’t find the right one that fits? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: This is 25 different micro, everything from hex nuts to screwdrivers to flatheads, and it’s a magnetic little insert into the actual one. Now you think, okay, who cares? But it’s $7.79 and it acts like a $25 screwdriver. It is the best stocking stuffer in the world. Once a year or twice a year you’ll get something where it takes two double As or whatever, and there’s a little, tiny screwdriver thing you’ve got to undo. Tim Ferriss: Totally. Kevin Rose: Where am I going to find something that fits that? This is that thing. And then when you want to tweak your glasses or whatever, you need those micro screwdrivers. Dude, $7, this thing rocks. It’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: How did you find this thing? Kevin Rose: It had good reviews on Amazon. I bought it and when I got it, I was like, they should be charging three times as much for this thing. The torque doesn’t actually ruin the bit heads, which is great because oftentimes with the cheaper ones, the bit heads get ruined. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: Anyway. You have to have it in every junk drawer in your house. It’s one of those things. But I love these things. Back in the day, when you were doing 5-Bullet Friday where you wanted me to contribute stuff, you would say, “Hey, what’s the best thing under $50, or whatever, that you love?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. This is it. Kevin Rose: This is one of those things that’s under $10 that is absolutely worth every penny. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love it. All right. So under $10, I don’t know if it’s $10, might be a little bit more, but in addition to the Rubz ball, I’ll just give a couple of quickfire. There’s something called the Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. It was actually introduced to me by Nsima Inyang, or Inyang, I think is how he pronounces it, but you sent me his video, so you are responsible — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — for me ultimately connecting with him. But this Alpha Ball for rolling out your hips, for traveling with, it’s about the size of a softball, but it’s just the perfect density and texture, you can get everywhere you need to get, which you cannot do with a foam roller, nor is it easy to travel with a foam roller. I just love this thing. I use it pretty much every day. So, that’s the two — Kevin Rose: I didn’t see it on video. Did you hold it up? Tim Ferriss: No, I have it downstairs in my suitcase actually. But the — Kevin Rose: Okay, let me look it up. What’s it called again? Tim Ferriss: Alpha Ball by Tune Up Fitness. You can find it on Amazon. It’s 19.99, more than worth every penny. I can send you a link to it, of course. Kevin Rose: Sweet. Tim Ferriss: Then other things I’ll throw in there, this is going to be one of those things. This is my version of your little TED talk that you just gave on the — Kevin Rose: Screwdrivers. Tim Ferriss: — $7 screwdrivers where people are like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” This is my version of that, which is the — I don’t know how to pronounce this, Maestri, M-A-E-S-T-R-I. Maestri House rechargeable milk frother. All right. Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know. Right? Kevin Rose: Mine was better than that, but — Tim Ferriss: Hold on — Kevin Rose: Keep going. Tim Ferriss: — hold on, hold on. I have owned so many of these frothers for coffee, for tea, for whatever, protein shakes or whatever, these little hand frothers. They always — Kevin Rose: They all break. They all suck, dude. Tim Ferriss: They all break, or the batteries die and then you can’t recharge it, or it’s — Kevin Rose: Yes. Tim Ferriss: — like an outboard motor and you’re like, oh, let me just do this for my tea and relax, and it shoots liquid all over the place. Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: There’s so many issues. This thing is like the Lamborghini of milk frothers. It costs — Kevin Rose: Ooh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It costs how much? 30 bucks. It’s not that crazy. Kevin Rose: It’s USB-C 2 charging. That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It’s USB-C. You basically turn the very top of it to adjust in any increment you want the intensity of the agitation. I have to tell you, I asked somebody on my team to just do diligence and get me a frother that would solve all these problems that I mentioned. He knows how to do a lot of research and this was his conclusion, and I got it and I was like, “Where has this been all my life? Oh, my God.” Has almost 3,000 reviews, or 2,600 reviews, 4.5 stars. This thing is just amazing. I use it every day. That’s one. When I put this in 5-Bullet Friday, what I wrote was, “It reminds me of Sage Wisdom from Kevin Kelly,” who is the founding editor of — Kevin Rose: Oh, I love Kevin Kelly. Tim Ferriss: — Wired magazine. Amazing guy. Kevin Rose: Yeah. We did a walk with him together. Tim Ferriss: Exactly. He had, at that time, I think it was a draft of a book that he put together, this tiny book called Excellent Advice for Living, which are these pithy little quotes from Kevin that he used to put in his — I think they were his birthday letters to friends where he’d be like, “Here are the 10 things I learned this year.” One of his pieces of advice is, “Take note if you find yourself wondering where is my good knife or where is my good pen. That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.” I have shelves full of shitty frothers that have been sent to me or that I’ve bought and they’re just terrible, so I just got rid of all of them and replaced them with this thing. Kevin Rose: That’s so awesome. Tim Ferriss: Other things, real quick: microphone. I got this microphone for travel called the Elgato, one word. Kevin Rose: Oh, yeah, I love Elgato. Tim Ferriss: Elgato Wave:3. It is a gorgeous piece of design. It makes me think of Braun design back in the day, B-R-A-U-N, and it actually solves, somehow, bounce and echo better than even this fancy mic, this Shure mic that I’m speaking into right now. It is really impressive. I don’t know what they do with the firmware, software, whoever the hell designs these types of things, but this has become my favorite travel mic, is the Elgato Wave:3. Also, not that expensive. Kevin Rose: Have you seen their prompter by the way? They make a tiny, little prompter — Tim Ferriss: I haven’t seen it. Kevin Rose: — if you want to read scripts or anything like that. Oh, Elgato makes this beautiful, little prompt you can control with an iPhone or an iPad. For people that are doing monologues and podcasts and stuff like that, Elgato is some great gear and it’s not that expensive. It’s well priced. Tim Ferriss: This one, the Wave:3 — I’ll check out the prompter — it’s got almost 10,000 reviews, 4.7 stars, 150 bucks. I rely on it to the extent that I’m professional, a professional loves recording. There’s a lot more I could jump into. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give one that is expensive, but the best of breed, which is the TANK M3 push sled. This is a sled. It’s literally sitting right outside my door, about 100 feet away. I have tried so many different sleds for resolving back pain, for building all posterior chain development and strength, glute activation, you name it. Pushing and pulling a sled just gives you so many dividends. KneesOverToesGuy also talks about this at length, but the TANK M3 push sled is — Kevin Rose: Holy shit, it’s pricey. Tim Ferriss: — bar none the best sled I’ve ever used. Yeah. How much is it? Did you just pull it up? Kevin Rose: 1,500 on Amazon. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 1,500. Yeah, 1,500 bucks. I would not — Kevin Rose: It looks amazing though. Tim Ferriss: I would not trade it. You can easily rotate it. It has mechanical resistance. For instance, I’m pushing it in a gravel driveway. It’s not just skids. You can use this on turf, you can use this on carpets, you can use it indoors without destroying the floor. It’s just an amazing sled. If people are looking for best of the best, in my opinion, and versatility, that’s one. And then if you don’t want more stuff or you want to give something to friends or family who don’t need more physical things — I am talking my book a little bit here because I’m involved with the company, but The Way App. It’s so easy, right? Kevin Rose: Henry’s the best, man. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to be doing hopefully another retreat in-person together. It started out as just my hand-down favorite meditation app. It’s the easiest way to get back in the habit. I just used it yesterday morning and this morning. I tend to do 10-minute sessions and then sometimes do an extra 10 minutes of TM or something after the fact. I think you can get 30 sessions for free with no credit card required — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — to try it out. And then if you want to give an annual membership, that’s 100 bucks. You can just download the app for free and then tap My Way and share it with people that way with a gift button. Kevin Rose: I’ll definitely add onto that. And I’ll say that I met Henry, the creator of The Way App, and he’s one of the very few Zen masters that are fully accredited in the United States. It is such a treat to interact with and have Henry as a guide and you get a pocket Zen master. I don’t want to sell this, but I will say that in the last — I started training with him in terms of meeting with him over Zoom during COVID, and now it’s been a few years, there is no better money spent in terms of — for me it has been more of retreats and things like that that I’ve been to of his. But meditation in terms of my just general anxiety and general way of moving through life, it’s been a game changer. It’s been a game changer. And Henry, I will give him a ton of credit there. One of the things that he told me early on, it still hits me today, is, “It’s not about, ‘Can I put in an hour a day of meditation?’ It’s better to put in just 10 minutes a day or five minutes a day and do it consistently than it is to try and achieve the mountaintop and go all out.” Can you just show up consistently? And I think if you do it for the first 30 days, you’ll feel it. You’ll feel it. Tim Ferriss: Oh, you’ll notice something much earlier, in my experience. Henry has this expression, I’m going to paraphrase it, but basically if you do the practice, even if in some sessions you’re like, my mind is all over the place, I feel like that was a waste of time, “If you walk consistently in the fog, you can’t help but get wet.” is one of his expressions, meaning it compounds over time and even if you feel like individual sessions aren’t doing much, it does actually compound. If people want to keep it simple, you can find a QR code at thewayapp.com/tim and that’ll give you 30 free sessions with no credit card, so people can check that out if they want. What else do we have, Kevin? You have — Kevin Rose: I’ve got one more that’s fun. It is on the slightly pricier side. It’s a little over $200, close to $300. Actually, it’s a walking treadmill. My wife, Darya, turned me onto this. It is a very thin, tiny, little walking treadmill that has phenomenal reviews. You just throw it underneath your desk and for under $300 you can set the incline to 10 and it’s all with a little, tiny remote control. There’s nothing to hold onto, because you have your desk. You can just work and it rolls away because it only weighs 50 pounds, and you can just stash it in the corner. I think it’s the best walking treadmill. We did a bunch of research and it’s the best one under $300. Great way to get some exercise in there. Throw on a weighted vest there and you’re in a really good place. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah, that’ll be plenty. I saw that when Darya was showing me her office. I was like, oh, look at that. There it is. Kevin Rose: That’s right. You got the tour. I wasn’t even home and you came over and stole my sleeping meds and — Tim Ferriss: Snagged your Belsomra — Kevin Rose: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: — took a spin on the walking treadmill and then took off. Yeah, I still owe you a trade for that. I do see in your notes, do you want to take a second and run people through Kevin’s current AI stack? This is all Greek to me, I don’t even understand what half of this means. Kevin Rose: Okay, real quick. I don’t know if you want to touch on New Year’s resolutions really fast — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, let’s do it after the AI stack. Kevin Rose: AI Stack, one of the things that I’ve noticed is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the space is this idea of an AI assistant that is not your phone, but something that you can call when you need to remember something, when you need to take notes, when you — Tim, I was wearing that little pendant when you and I got together. Tim Ferriss: Hate it, hate it. Kevin Rose: It’s always recording, and Tim goes to me, he is like, “It’s always recording?” I was like, “Yeah.” And he goes, “I hate to ask you this, but can you just take it off? It’s too much anxiety for me.” So I had to take off that pendant and put it in my bag. But I agree with you, in that it is weird. It does cripple our conversations in our honesty when you know there’s something that’s listening all the time, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100 percent. Kevin Rose: A couple things, Nothing, the Android phone company, I’m not an investor or anything like that, they make headphones, which I’m wearing right now for this podcast. But one of the things that was really cool, when they released these headphones a month ago, they have a little talk button on the headphones. If you hold down talk as you’re holding your headphones case, I can record anything and it goes into their AI and it creates to-do lists for me, notes — Tim Ferriss: That’s cool. Kevin Rose: — whatever it may be. Tim Ferriss: That’s a cool feature. Kevin Rose: It’s just fun. Yeah. There was a company called Sandbar and we invested. True, it wasn’t my deal. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. Do you need to have an Android phone to use those? Kevin Rose: Yes, you need to have a Nothing phone. Tim Ferriss: Bummer. Kevin Rose: That’s the problem. But the idea is sound in that it’s not always on, it’s just when you need it, right? Tim Ferriss: Yep, yep. Kevin Rose: One of the things that Sandbar did, and I have one of their prototype rings around here somewhere. One of the things that Sandbar did is they created a ring, almost like an Oura ring, where if you just lightly touch it, you can whisper to any notes that you might want and it saves it in the AI cloud on your phone, Android OS, whatever. If you have headphones in, it’ll respond back to you. So like, “Hey. Remind me, what’s that meeting I have tomorrow?” just quietly. It doesn’t listen to the entire room, and then it gives you that data back in your headphones. Anyway. Sandbar is not out yet. It’s coming out middle of next year. I highly recommend sandbar.com, checking out. Like I said, it is something that we invest in at the fund level, but it’s not my deal. But I will say, I like where this is going. Even if it’s not Sandbar, something like this that is a little companion, that is not your big ass phone, that can be engaged with when you want to jot something down is quite cool. Outside of that, I would say AI on the Notion front has been quite good. The agents that they’ve added inside of Notion are phenomenal and that continues to get better. Tim Ferriss: What do you use that for? How do you use that? Kevin Rose: Notion, just added note-taking now. If you’re in a Zoom or any type of video call, it will automatically prompt you to record the entire thing. By default, I always say to people, Notion’s not actually recording the audio, but they are transcribing it, and they put the meeting notes and the bullet points into my Notion for me, and then I can ask questions of that transcript later on. Call it a week or two later, I’m like, “Hey, Tim mentioned some really cool book by Anthony de Mello, which one was it?” and it would, boom, right there, it’s within two seconds. That’s really cool. And then you can ask questions of your entire corpus of data. So, if you’re storing a bunch of stuff in there — I had my EIN number for one of my LCs and I’d be like, “Hey, what’s the EIN number for this LC?” Two seconds later, it’s out. That’s fun. Tim Ferriss: When do you think Gemini built into G Suite will be good enough to do that for an inbox? Kevin Rose: It is now. It is now. Tim Ferriss: Is it? Kevin Rose: Yeah, it is. Tim Ferriss: Because it was so disappointing as of even a few weeks ago. Kevin Rose: I just enabled it, this deeper integration. I don’t know if I’m a beta tester, but they let me in, and it does exactly what I just said. It’s within the coming weeks if I’ve happened to be on some beta list and whatever. Who will do this right now is actually the Gemini — oh, what are they calling it? It’s their AI suite where you can drop documents into it and everything. Everyone’s screaming it right at me. You know what I’m talking about, right? Have you played with this? Tim Ferriss: No, no. Oh, wait, are you talking about NotebookLM? No. Kevin Rose: Yeah, NotebookLM. Yeah, NotebookLM is getting better and better. Here’s a fun hack. This is a great one for your audience because they like your productivity, everything. One thing that’s really fun is, imagine there’s something you want to learn that’s new. Insert anything. You want to learn how to do basic Pilates. Go to ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever else and say, “Hey, give me a deep research guide on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and then you hit go. You wait five minutes, whatever, it gives you back a whole script. You copy that, paste it into NotebookLM, and say, “Create me a five-minute podcast on the fundamentals of Pilates,” and you have an instant podcast primer on that thing. I use that for coding technologies. I’ve used that for quantum computing. Tim, do you know how quantum computing works? Do you know how gates fold on each other when — Tim Ferriss: No. Kevin Rose: I didn’t. I dropped that in there and then you say, “Explain it like I’m five in a podcast.” Or not five, but you’d say, “Explain it like I’m a — Tim Ferriss: Fifth grader. Kevin Rose: — freshman in college.” Yeah, like I’m a fifth grader, whatever. I have aphantasia and I have no way to recall this later. It gives you this great, little podcast and it’s a fun, little way to learn anything new on the go. Tim Ferriss: I have to give a plug, and I am an investor in this company. It came up in a group thread. I don’t think he would mind me mentioning this. Our mutual friend, Chris Sacca, was like, “My daughter just taught herself about stock trading,” and this, this, and this. He took a screenshot and he’s like, “She created her own curriculum,” and — It was from a startup called Oboe. If people go to Oboe, that’s O-B-O-E.fyi, so oboe.fyi, it just says, “What do you want to learn about? We’ll make you a course.” You literally just type it out and it gives you everything in one place. Kevin Rose: Are you an investor in this? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m an investor. Mm-hmm. Kevin Rose: I noticed you had mentioned before — what was it? This would be fun for 30 seconds. When you were pitched this, because you were very — you say no to a lot of things, which is great, as every — Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: — investor should. What was it about this that really hooked you in? Tim Ferriss: There were a few things. It was the people involved. I had some familiarity with the people involved and I had confidence in their ability to execute. Also, this is what I do, right? In the sense that if I have tried to hone any single skill, it is deconstructing and simplifying complex subjects, then putting material in some type of logical sequence, doing 80/20 analysis on the 20 percent of material that makes the difference, and the material beats method a lot of the time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I’ve thought a lot about this and I was like, all right, the thesis and mission of the company makes a lot of sense to me. Will they be the winner? I have no idea. That is a much harder question. That informs bet sizing and things along those lines. But I have a lot of confidence in the founders. The company itself was introduced to me, or the founding team behind it, by another founder who’s had exits, who is an investor, who’s a friend of mine. And I thought to myself, even if this just goes towards creating a product that I, myself will use — which is really where I start with a lot of my investing. Sometimes I succeed when I stray from that, but my hit rate is a lot higher when — say, in the case of Uber or Shopify or any of these other — Kevin Rose: Yes, it’s a core competence of yours. Tim Ferriss: Duolingo, these are — I know at least I am a market of one — Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: — for all of these products, and Oboe would fall in that category. That’s how I decided to invest. With these companies, it’s also not a bet-the-farm scenario, at least not for me. It’s you’re creating a portfolio with the recognition that 70, 80 percent of your investments are going to go to zero. But I try to answer the question, how can I win even if this goes to zero? How can I win? It’s if I help to in some way support a product and the development of a product that I use myself to learn a bunch of stuff quickly, then given the leverage that I think I can create or find in the world, it’s like, wow. If I have a smooth way, an elegant way to learn more about a few different — I’ll give you an example. If I’m considering, and I’ve already done this, if I’m doing due diligence on a company that I can’t talk about right now, but it’s innovating in biotech, and I want to learn as much as possible about different types of mRNA therapeutics, I’m not coming from a background that enables me to do that. If I then am able to do due diligence a hundred times faster because I’m not sending out 15 emails to people I think might be able to assist, and I’d still do that level of due diligence, but if let’s just say that 50 K investment allows me to then do due diligence in a way that allows me to place two or three other bets more effectively, I’ve very likely made my money back. Whether it’s with investing or choosing projects like the card game, Coyote, or anything else, my fundamental, underlying question is: Can this be a win even if it fails with, let’s just say, the primary external metric of sales or exit or whatever it might be? If I’m developing skills and relationships that snowball and transcend any single project, then that’s a vote in favor of doing something. oboe.fyi would fit into that bucket for me. It made me so happy to see Sacca’s daughter when she’s whatever, 12 or 13, creating her own course. I was like, okay, that’s a good sign that makes me happy. Kevin Rose: I just clicked on one of the things to create a course for me. It’s pretty cool because right away it said, “Do you want this in podcast format, which is seven minutes?” or, “Do you want this in lectured recording, which is 20 minutes?” Tim Ferriss: That’s awesome. Kevin Rose: That’s built into the product from step one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, from step one. And like you said, this is the blocky, brick, Motorola version. The rate of iteration for something like this is going to be so extreme, it’s going to be head spinning, so we’ll see. Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: I’m excited about it. Kevin Rose: All right, the moment you all have been waiting for, Tim’s girlfriend. Tim Ferriss: Thought I — Kevin Rose: Come on, dude. Tim Ferriss: Thought I got out of — Kevin Rose: No, no, no. People are — Tim Ferriss: I — Kevin Rose: They want to know what’s up with Tim’s personal life. Tim Ferriss: I’m not going to dox anyone who doesn’t opt into being doxed, so I’ll skip any identifying particulars. It’s getting serious quickly. She’s incredibly — Kevin Rose: Wow. Tim Ferriss: — sweet, incredibly self-aware, intelligent. For people who are wondering, of all places, met on Hinge. Have to kiss a lot of frogs or go on a lot of dates, it’s a lot of reps, a lot of swiping and a lot of noise to get to that point. But it did work. Kevin Rose: What was the first date like? Tim Ferriss: First date was Greek food, very chill, felt very much — I pay a lot of attention to this. You know that I have a very sensitive nervous system, and I just immediately felt down-regulated and at ease with her. That’s a lot. That’s not a small thing for me. Keeps me on my toes, is very funny, is very good at calling me on my bullshit. I’m optimistic. We’ll see. We’ll see. Super, super happy. Doing Thanksgiving together and — Kevin Rose: Oh, wow. Family introduction time and all that shit? Tim Ferriss: Oh, she met my family already quite a while ago. It’s — Kevin Rose: I’ve only met her once. One final question then I’ll let you out the hot box. What is the hardest thing for you at this stage? Because you get to this point where there’s this honeymoon phase and then all of a sudden that starts to peel off and it’s in the nitty-gritty of life. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: What’s the hardest, most challenging part about this next, call it, six months? Tim Ferriss: I don’t know if I have the ability to predict, but my guess would be — I think what I’m about to describe is a plight of modern dating in general, at least as I’ve seen it among my friends and pretty much anyone who I’ve ever spoken to about this or if I ever mention modern datings in the app-based dating world. It’s such a game of roulette. The apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. I think the challenge for almost anyone who has been part of that playing field is when things get hard, when things are hard, when you have friction that lasts more than a day or a week, to stay the course and do the work necessary to resolve that as opposed to just being like, ah, fuck this, I’m just going to go back to the well. Kevin Rose: Because the well’s right there. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: It’s 20 seconds away and a swipe away, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Kevin Rose: That’s the downfall of these whole things. It’s so easy to move on to the next thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. They are all designed to be, of course, as addictive as possible. And even though they might say they’re designed to be deleted, by definition, since they have a fiduciary responsibility, a legal fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, their business model is entirely dependent on recurring revenue. So, they’re designed to keep you using the app as long as humanly possible. I don’t blame them for that. That’s just the way that this ecosystem works. But it is something to be aware of because they are seductive and they’re designed to be seductive, these apps, in every way conceivable. I would say that, step number one, take that stuff off your phone. And then number two is, fortunately I feel like over my last few long relationships — I’ve had some very long relationships. Five, six years in two cases — that I’ve developed a toolkit. I can always use more work and more refinement, but it’s like, do you have the basics of something approximating Nonviolent Communication? Do you ask for what you want and do you tell someone if they’re doing something that you don’t want? These seem like very obvious, self-evident things you should do, but a lot of people struggle with both of those, and then that breeds resentment or people bottle things up and then they explode and they say things they can’t take back. To what extent have you tried to mitigate those things? Do you have a toolkit? There are very good books out there, very good workshops. I’ve read a lot of these books and I’ve gone to a lot of workshops. As much as I’ve felt like I wanted to poke my eyes out with bicycle spokes at points in these workshops and seminars because I can only take so much of it — Kevin Rose: Same. Tim Ferriss: — they do help though. It could be something really small. And there are things you learn along the way, at least I have, as you get older, which is you can have almost anything you want in life if you discuss it openly and early. If you have weaknesses, if you have requests, if you have needs, if you have things that you value that are maybe weirdly out of proportion to most people, just talking about that stuff early sets the stage for success or at least communication. Very early on in this relationship, having conversations about conversations, if that makes sense, having open communication about how we’d like to communicate the challenges we have with communication. How we’re going to communicate, biasing towards honesty and being direct, even if you need to do a little bit of cleanup afterwards, has just saved a lot of brand damage. In this case, I think we both have very growth-oriented mindsets. I think both of us are pretty good at taking feedback. There are times when you’re just too sleep deprived or pissed off or bitchy or irritable, and you’re not good at taking feedback. You’re always going to have those days. But overall, I think we’re both eager to improve and we’re good at giving feedback in a way that generally doesn’t come off as too holier than now, judgmental. We’ll see, we’ll see. But in terms of the challenges, I think the challenges are always — I shouldn’t say always, that’s a big word. Man, so much of it just comes down to communication. Do you have the tools? Have you, say, read or listened to Terry Real? Have you both listened or read Terry Real so that you have some scripts or some shared language that you can use as shorthand? And — Kevin Rose: The problem I have with Terry Real is that if it’s taken too literally, it can sound formulaic. Tim Ferriss: Sure. Kevin Rose: I don’t want to do the formula, let’s just talk, it can be a bit — Tim Ferriss: Here’s what I would say about that. I’d say that almost anything that works repeatedly is a formula. In the beginning, I think it’s important, as rote as it might seem, to — let’s just say the book, Nonviolent Communication, I think it’s Marshall Rosenberg, it’s a great book, but after a while you’re like, oh, my God, am I really going to say again, “When you did X, as a video camera would’ve recorded it, I felt Y. And the story I make up is X.” Kevin Rose: That stuff. “The story I make up…” kills me. Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. I know it kills you and — Kevin Rose: Stop saying, “The story I make up…” Tim Ferriss: But here’s the thing. As much as you might hate it, what you would hate more is, “Kevin, I fucking hate when you do X. It makes me feel Y, because you always do Z.” That’s worse, I think, right? You might be like — Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — ah, with the formula, but the amount of damage you can do when you veer completely away from it is a lot. And then once you have the, I’d say, basic mastery or fluency with the formula, then you can deviate, right? Kevin Rose: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: Then you can start to deviate. But for instance, Terry, as any couples therapist, has certain frameworks and formulas. But there are also underlying philosophical principles that I think apply to a million different things that are outside of formulas. I’ll give you an example. One thing that Terry says — I think this is in Fierce Intimacy, which is an audio book, you can’t find a print version of it. I highly recommend it to folks. The point he makes is — it’s real simple — objective reality has no place in a relationship. What the hell does that mean? What that means is if you’re out at dinner and then the waiter comes over and the wife orders and then the waiter walks away and the husband’s like, “Honey, you don’t need to yell at him,” and she’s like, “I wasn’t yelling,” and then it turns into a whole bullshit argument about whether she was yelling or not. If the husband were to say, “Honey, actually I hired a professional audiologist with the latest cutting-edge technology and recording equipment, and they’re sitting right at the table next to us. If we accept the commonly defined threshold for yelling at XYZ decimals, if you look at these numbers, you can see that in fact you were, by scientific definition, yelling,” is that going to fix the problem? No, it’s going to be a huge fucking mess, right? Kevin Rose: Right. Tim Ferriss: His point is the stories matter and the subjective matters and very — shorthand for that is objective — he may not word it exactly this way, but objective reality just doesn’t have a place in, let’s just say, an argument. We’re going to make mistakes. Occasionally, especially someone like me is going to try to appeal to some objective measure of God knows what. But if you can just postpone that judgment even for a minute or two, it just makes a world of difference, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Maybe it makes me sound like I’m really remedial in the EQ communication department. I actually don’t think that’s true. I think I’m pretty good. It’s like going to the gym, it’s like playing pool or shooting archery or whatever, it’s not a one-and-done thing, right? Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you don’t practice these things, you will revert to whatever your parents did. Period. Kevin Rose: Yeah, it’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And I don’t want to model that. That was a goddamn mess. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I found that if my partner gets upset, just sitting down and saying, “Calm down.” is huge. Tim Ferriss: That works — Kevin Rose: It just works every time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Kevin Rose: Or, “You’re being like your mother.” Those are things that are just really just home runs. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. “Why are you so hysterical like your mother?” Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Works like a charm. I think that’s Terry Real’s second principle. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Just say “calm down” and then you’re good, you’re good. They’ll be like, “Oh, I was being so crazy. You’re right. I should just calm down.” Tim Ferriss: I think also just expecting there to be bumps. There are always going to be bumps and — we’ll see, we’ll see. But — Kevin Rose: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s been great so far. I feel super, super lucky, really, really fortunate. Kevin Rose: Yeah. I mean, you only date supermodels, so you should feel lucky. Tim Ferriss: That’s not true. That’s not true. Kevin Rose: I’ve met her. You have a supermodel on your hands. She’s great. Tim Ferriss: She’s very pretty, but she’s also very, very smart, knows how to adult, knows how to take care of things in the world. Which isn’t asking too much, but it’s surprising how many aspiring stay-at-home girlfriends you can find out there who have no intention of operating in the world. I feel very, very lucky, super, super fortunate. Kevin Rose: I’m excited for you, dude. Tim Ferriss: Yeah — Kevin Rose: Can we just spend some more time with her? Our first interactions were great. I’m excited to get to know her better. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, she’s incredibly kind, not a malicious bone in her body, but at the same time, hilariously blunt in some cases and sometimes not so hilariously blunt, but I’ll take it. It’s a package deal, I’ll take it. Kevin Rose: You’ve got a bit of that too though, right? So, it’s like — Tim Ferriss: I’ve got some of that. Yeah, I do too. I’ve got some of that, for sure. Kevin Rose: I’ve known enough of your ex-girlfriends to know that you’ve got a little bit of that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’ve got a little bit of that. It’s true. Oh, man. I think I’ve probably checked the box of talking about the girlfriend. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Awesome. Tim Ferriss: We’re going to have dinner very shortly. Happy Thanksgiving, man. Kevin Rose: Yeah, happy Thanksgiving. I would say the only thing on my side, just to bring people to speed on, is I have a new tech podcast that I’m very excited about that I’m going to launch in the new year. Kevinrose.com for my 4-Bullet Friday, which is a much faster read. No, I don’t — I only put out one email every month and a half or every — but it’s always packed with the latest AI stuff I’m playing with, all that stuff. Anyway. That’s my only plug of the show, is kevinrose.com, for the newsletter. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, check it out. Check it out, folks. We’ll hit New Year’s resolutions and stuff next time we do a Random Show. Let’s do it. Yeah. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We’ll do that, because I need to dust mine off and blow the film that has settled on those and look at them in higher resolution, so I could use a little extra time. And we’ll — Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: We’ll get after it. Kevin Rose: Love you, brother. Always good to see you. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, love you too, bud. Kevin Rose: And thanks for sharing more of the personal side with us. Everybody gets a kick out of that and it’s always fun to hear your adventures. But I’m excited for you marching forward and I have good vibes about this one. Tim Ferriss: Thanks, man. It’s a fucking jungle out there. Kevin Rose: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Modern dating, it is simultaneously so fun if you hit your groove in a playing-the-field kind of way, but it’s also so incredibly exhausting and frustrating and can be very demoralizing. And — Kevin Rose: I don’t feel bad for you, honestly. I’ve gotten some of your texts. I think you had a damn good run. You had a good run. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m not complaining. I’m just saying I feel most at home, at ease, at peace when I am with my current girlfriend. It’s qualitatively a world of difference from just running around like some horny bastard with his hair on fire. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but — Kevin Rose: Not that there’s any hair left, but yeah. Tim Ferriss: Not that there’s any hair left. And also just be aware, whether you’re on X or Instagram, but especially on the dating apps because it is selling sex and things that are hardwired to hijack your attention, your faculties are being exploited to the maximum degree possible. It’s just something to be aware of. Really check your state before and after using these things to determine how much you might want to use them or if you want to put safeguards around how long you spend on these things. All right. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Kevin Rose: Love it. Tim Ferriss: Cool, brother. Love you very much. Please give a hug to Darya and the girls for me. Kevin Rose: Will do. Tim Ferriss: And — Kevin Rose: Same on my side. How’s Molly doing? Molly’s good? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s great. Yeah, Molly’s doing great. And — Kevin Rose: How old is Molly now? Tim Ferriss: Molly’s 10. I’m actually going to adopt a — Kevin Rose: Ah. Tim Ferriss: — puppy. I’m going to get a second dog next month. Super excited. Kevin Rose: Toaster’s 15 now. You saw him when you came to the house. Tim Ferriss: I did. Kevin Rose: I wasn’t there when you were there. Tim Ferriss: Oh. Kevin Rose: Isn’t he moving slower? It’s hard to watch. Tim Ferriss: He was. He also had just come from the vet and his paw was all taped up and he was — Kevin Rose: Oh, geez. Tim Ferriss: — drugged out of his mind — Kevin Rose: I know. Tim Ferriss: — when I saw him. Yeah, 15, he’s getting up there. Kevin Rose: I know. We gave him rapa, so I’m hoping for — I mean, we’ve already seen a 20 percent boost in lifespan, so we’ll see. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I need to get Molly on rapa. That’s going to be one of my tasks for December as well. One step at a time. Kevin Rose: Awesome. All right, brother. Tim Ferriss: All right, brother. Great to see you, bud. Kevin Rose: Great to see you. Tim Ferriss: Everybody listening, you can go to the show notes. We’ll have links to everything at tim.blog/podcast. Random Show, just look for the newest one and we’ll have it for you. Happy holidays, everybody. Thanks for tuning in. Kevin Rose: Happy holidays. Tim Ferriss: I’ll see you soon, Kevin. Take care, bud. Kevin Rose: Peace. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool. Critical is fine, but if you're rude, we'll delete your stuff.
