ByJohn Koetsier, Senior Contributor. Marketing and AI are getting married, and it’s a shotgun wedding. Marketing technology firms and the big AI platforms are furiously launching new capabilities that they say will help brands know us, feel our pain, understand our frustrations, intuit our desires and always send the right message at the right time to give us exactly what we want. But is that true? Or will consumers feel outgunned and manipulated by brands with seemingly god-like powers of knowing too much? At its Forge conference in Las Vegas last week, customer engagement platform Braze unveiled a sweeping set of AI and platform innovations designed to transform how brands interact with their customers. The centerpiece: AI agents: autonomous systems that can analyze terabytes of data, optimize campaigns, and craft content on behalf of marketers. Everyone’s making agents. OpenAI recently released agentic capabilities inside ChatGPT, and yesterday announced an agent builder at its DevDay event. Competitor Anthropic, which makes the Claude LLM, announced its Agent SDK yesterday too, as did the AI voice startup Eleven Labs. AI agent use in customer service grew 22X this year alone, according to Salesforce, which is also building and shipping agents. Marketing software HubSpot just launched 15 agents. Adobe, which offers a marketing cloud with dozens of software tools for marketers, launched even more agents, and these are just a few of the companies launching AI agents. Braze’s focus, like Agent Smith multiplying hundreds of times in the second Matrix movie, is giving every marketer super-powers via their own teams of intelligent, autonomous agents. Think winback agents (AI agents to get you back after you left. Cart abandonment agents (AI agents to coax you to buy that thing that you decided not to. Next purchase agents (AI agents to study your past behavior and intuit what you might buy next). And, of course, customer service agents and support agents and just about any kind of AI agent a brand can dream up for writing emails, sending push notifications, shooting you a quick chatty SMS or WhatsApp, and more. We used to say “there’s an app for that” to reference the impression that there’s apps for literally everything imaginable. Now, apparently, we’re approaching a future in which “there’s an agent for that.” So we’re rushing towards a world in which most of brand communication to customers will be not just automated--which it has been for years--but tailored, customized, and even personalized by smart AI agents to help you get what you want. Or, perhaps, to make you buy more. What’s that world going to look like? Braze CMO Astha Malik says it’s going to make brands smarter about what they send you. That it might result in fewer messages and less spam. “I want different things from different companies,” she told me. “That’s because I’m complicated.” In other words: the out-of-stock beauty product she wanted but couldn’t get: yes, she wants an immediate notification via SMS or a push notification. The home furnishings she was just browsing? Nope, don’t even think about sending a real-time message. Maybe email instead. On the face of it, that’s great for everyone. Consumers get what they want, brands get more sales, and everyone’s happy. Of course, the cost is giving brands that you like and buy from your personal information. Contact information, preferences information, and--of course--all the data that you using their websites and apps reveals about who you are and what you like. Not everyone at the conference was certain they liked the trade, including Dweeti Fanshawe, a marketer at EasyJet: “Because of the nature of where we work, I analyze how they know this,” she told me. “Should I be giving them less data?” Others were totally fine with the exchange. Mallory Gordon from Pacify Health told me that she wants brands that she likes and trusts to brands to know, understand, and anticipate her needs. That she has a strong preference for timing-specific, relevant communications, and that she pays attention to companies who show genuine customer understanding. “I connect with that so much more than just a generalized message of, oh, here’s 20% off of at the store … or a product you didn’t even want,” she told me. “And I think that’s true for a lot of people." For Braze product leader Kevin Wang, the key is brands implementing hard-core guardrails and exercising caution in using these newfound powers. Each message has a cost, and getting it wrong will feel like an invasion of privacy. “It is corrosive to your brand to not be relevant," Wang says. “I’ve gotten a bunch of really poorly timed push notifications. It just makes me think they’re dumb. And it’s like, I don’t want to work with dumb people." So: with great power comes great responsibility. That’s true from a number of different angles, of course. Marketing has always been about persuasion, and marketers have always had a lot of emotional tricks up their sleeve like scarcity ("only three left") or appeal to authority (95% of doctors agree") or social proof ("millions sold") and the like. The question is will AI supercharge this ability to persuade, and could this result in consumer harm? It’s at least worth thinking about. Duke University’s Ali Makhdoumi says, for example, that companies have a growing information advantage over consumers and that “constant improvements of large language models and machine learning capabilities will likely offer even more opportunities for behavioral manipulation.” That’s mostly in reference to large online platforms, but brands are increasingly capturing and storing more data as well. The good news is that you’re in control. Don’t like messages from a company? Turn it off in the app preferences, or--last resort--block the company. I’ve gotten some good push notifications from Uber, including discounts, but the company has yet to learn I only Uber when I travel … and so is sending me push notifications as I sit in my home office, making that off button very tempting indeed. The other good news is that in spite of every advance in AI and agents, it’s still too expensive for brands to simply apply AI agents to every customer. The compute costs would be far too high, Wang said. Marketing companies like Braze are fully aware of the potential problems, says co-founder and CTO Jon Hyman, which is why they’re applying AI to new features for message prioritization, ensuring brands send fewer but better notifications to their customers. There’s an ever better solution, however. Ultimately, we’ll each have our own agents, says Malik. “Their agents are going to be talking to your agents … the whole notion of like ‘my people can talk to your people’ is going to be ‘my agents are going to talk to your agents.’ And that is going to happen,” says the Braze CMO. We already see that somewhat in our email inboxes, where Gmail and Apple Mail apply prioritization rules that govern what we see, and what’s a little more hidden. They’re not yet using AI agents, but they are limiting distractions. Our own trusted and reliable AI agents will fully restore the balance of power. And ultimately, they could lead to the most efficient kind of market where indeed, you do get exactly what you want, and at--or close to--the price you want to pay, while brands do get a chance to get their messages and offers and communications in front of you. Or in front of your trusted personal AI agent.

Title: The public company isn’t dead, it’s misunderstood

Sarah Keohane Williamson is the Chief Executive Officer of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit research organization whose mission is to focus capital on the long term to support a sustainable and prosperous economy. Under her leadership, FCLTGlobal develops innovative, practical research and builds a global community of CEOs focused on solving long-term challenges across the investment value chain. She is the author of "The CEO’s Guide to the Investment Galaxy." Record levels of private capital and the recent and rapid rise of VC-funded unicorns suggest to some that public markets are a thing of the past, a holdover from the capitalism of yesteryear. Financial news of the past two decades is littered with stories of companies delaying IPOs and growing despite it — Meta, Uber, Airbnb and the like. Some still remain private, most notably Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If they can find success without going public, why should anyone else? Take the example of Klarna — a 20-year-old company — which recently had a successful IPO on the NYSE, with a nice pop on its first day. Why would a company like Klarna choose to go public? Public companies have to deal with public investors, follow specific rules on governance, and disclose extensive information. Klarna had no trouble accessing private capital in the past. Surely some of their original backers were looking for liquidity, but there is plenty of private liquidity around if that is all they need. Many companies have decided that the private markets are a better place to be. Over the last couple of decades, the number of listed companies and new IPOs in developed markets has dropped dramatically. The rigor and scrutiny of being publicly traded, and the perceived pressures that come with opening up the shareholder roll, are burdens many companies would prefer to avoid. So why go public? The answer is that there are great benefits to being a listed company in a deep, global market. While there are plenty of capital options besides going public, public markets help companies grow up. That discipline and credibility, as well as the opportunity for founders, employees, and investors to benefit from the value created, still make public markets the destination of choice. And while listings did indeed drop over the past 30 or so years, in that same timeframe, global public market capitalization rose to over $90 trillion, or about 112% of global GDP. Public markets aren’t dead — they’re just misunderstood. The idea that companies must choose between the quarterly spin cycle and the refuge of private markets is a myth. With the right strategy and the right investors, public companies still deliver superior long-term value. It’s true, public companies spend a lot of time on the quarter — hitting or missing targets, talking to the Street, etc. But the reality is that providing estimates of your next quarter’s earnings only encourages traders to make short-term bets and increases the volatility of your stock price. It’s a habit, not a requirement. The best companies recognize that such a myopic focus on the quarterly cycle is a distraction from building a great business. To avoid it, most companies don’t issue quarterly earnings guidance anymore; by 2024, only 21% of S&P 500 companies were still doing so, down from 36% in 2010. Public companies have plenty of opportunities to talk to the investment community. But “investors” are not a monolith, something many CEOs find out too late. They have different horizons and incentives; some are seeking durable returns over decades, while others are simply looking for alpha. This is not criticism. It’s reality. But evidence shows that an increase in short-term, transient investors is associated with cuts to long-term investments (R&D, marketing, etc.) in order to increase short-term earnings, leading to temporary boosts in equity valuations that reverse over time. While CEOs can’t bar investors from buying stock in the public markets, they can have an investor strategy that tries to attract the best long-term investors by understanding their time frames and incentives. Companies that find success in this regard employ several key tactics: they engage consistently with large shareholders throughout the year (rather than limiting interactions to AGM seasons). They deploy CEO and board-level leadership for key shareholder meetings and, importantly, align IR professional incentives with long-term shareholder success metrics rather than short-term sell-side ratings. This comprehensive approach reduces an emphasis on 90-day cycles, creates deeper shareholder support, and unlocks mutual value for both investors and public companies. To be sure, there are advantages to staying private for companies in certain circumstances. But public markets remain an unmatched source of capital, credibility, and the opportunity to scale. It’s time to stop viewing them as a necessary evil and instead as a strategic asset — as long as companies can navigate them with intent and with the right strategies in place. Public companies aren’t dying, but CEOs who don’t adapt their investor strategy will.

Title: OpenAI’s Windows Play

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: OpenAI’s flood of announcements are getting hard to keep up with. A selection — not exhaustive! — from just the last month: The last two announcements just dropped yesterday, and actually bring clarity and coherence to the entire list. In short, OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. For nearly two decades smartphones, and in particular iOS, have been the touchstones in terms of discussing platforms. It’s important to note, however, that while Apple’s strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely profitable, it entailed leaving the door open for a competing platform to emerge. The challenge of being a hardware company is that by virtue of needing to actually create devices you can’t serve everyone; Apple in particular didn’t have the capacity or desire to go downmarket, which created the opportunity for Android to not only establish a competing platform but to actually significantly exceed iOS in market share. That means that if we want a historical analogy for total platform dominance — which increasingly appears to be OpenAI’s goal — we have to go back further to the PC era and Windows. Before there was Windows there was DOS; before DOS, however, there was a fast-talking deal-making entrepreneur named Bill Gates. From The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac: In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS, which they acquired from another company — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft. The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless. There is nothing like IBM and its dominant position in enterprise today; rather, the route to becoming a platform is to first be a massively popular product. Acquiring developers and users is not a chicken-and-egg problem: it is clear that you must get users first, which attracts developers, enhancing your platform in a virtuous cycle; to put it another way, first a product must Aggregate users and then it gets developers for free. ChatGPT is exactly that sort of product, and at yesterday’s DevDay 2025 keynote CEO Sam Altman and team demonstrated exactly that sort of pull; from The Verge: OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. The idea is that, from within a conversation with the chatbot, you can essentially tag in apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map — which the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. It’s fair to wonder if these app experiences will measure up to these company’s self-built apps or websites, just as there are questions about just how well the company’s Instant Checkout will convert; what is notable, however, is that I disagree that this represents a “push to integrate…with the rest of the web”. This is the opposite: this is a push to make ChatGPT the operating system of the future. Apps won’t be on your phone or in a browser; they’ll be in ChatGPT, and if they aren’t, they simply will not exist for ChatGPT users. That, by extension, means the burden of making these integrations work — and those conversions performant — will be on third party developers, not OpenAI. This is the power that comes from owning users, and OpenAI is flexing that power in a major way. There is a second aspect to the IBM PC strategy, and that is the role of AMD. From a 2024 Update: While IBM chose Intel to provide the PC’s processor, they were wary of being reliant on a single supplier (it’s notable that IBM didn’t demand the same of the operating system, which was probably a combination of not fully appreciating operating systems as a point of integration and lock-in for 3rd-party software, which barely existed at that point, and a recognition that software is just bits and not a physical good that has to be manufactured). To that end IBM demanded that Intel license its processor to another chip firm, and AMD was the obvious choice: the firm was founded by Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor alum who had worked with Intel’s founders, and specialized in manufacturing licensed chips. The relationship between Intel and AMD ended up being incredibly fraught and largely documented by endless lawsuits (you can read a brief history in that Update); the key point to understand, however, is that (1) IBM wanted to have dual suppliers to avoid being captive to an essential component provider and (2) IBM had the power to make that happen because they had the customers who were going to provide Intel so much volume. The true beneficiary of IBM’s foresight, of course, was Microsoft, which controlled the operating system; IBM’s mandate is why it is appropriate that “Windows” comes first in the “Wintel” characterization of the PC era. Intel reaped tremendous profits from its position in the PC value chain, but more value accrued to Microsoft than anyone else. This question of who will capture the most profit from the AI value chain remains an open one. There’s no question that the early winner is Nvidia: the company has become the most valuable in the world by virtue of its combination of best-in-class GPUs, superior networking, and CUDA software layer that locks people into Nvidia’s own platform. And, as long as power is the limiting factor, Nvidia is well-placed to maintain its position. What Nvidia is not shy about is capturing its share of value, and that is a powerful incentive for other companies in the value chain to look for alternatives. Google is the furthest along in this regard thanks to its decade-old investment in TPUs, while Amazon is seeking to mimic their strategy with Trainium; Microsoft and Meta are both working to design and build their own chips, and Apple is upscaling Apple Silicon for use in the data center. Once again, however, the most obvious and most immediately available alternative to Nvidia is AMD, and I think the parallels between yesterday’s announcement of an OpenAI-AMD deal and IBM’s strong-arming of Intel are very clear; from the Wall Street Journal: OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that will run on AMD processors, one of the most direct challenges yet to industry leader Nvidia. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, starting with the MI450 chip next year. The ChatGPT maker will buy the chips either directly or through its cloud computing partners. AMD chief Lisa Su said in an interview Sunday that the deal would result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade. The two companies didn’t disclose the plan’s expected overall cost, but AMD said it costs tens of billions of dollars per gigawatt of computing capacity. OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the chip company, at 1 cent per share, awarded in phases, if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD’s stock price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. If OpenAI is the software layer that matters to the ecosystem, then Nvidia’s long-term pricing power will be diminished; the company, like Intel, may still take the lion’s share of chip profits through sheer performance and low-level lock-in, but I believe the most important reason OpenAI is making this deal is to lock in its own dominant position in the stack. It is pretty notable that this announcement comes only weeks after Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI; that, though, is another affirmation that the company who has the users has the ultimate power. There is one other part of the stack to keep an eye on: TSMC. Both Nvidia and AMD make their chips with the Taiwanese giant, and while TSMC is famously reticent to take price, they are positioned to do so in the long run. Altman surely knows this as well, which means that I wouldn’t be surprised if there is an Intel announcement sooner rather than later; maybe there is fire to that recent smoke about AMD talking with Intel? When I started writing Stratechery, Windows was a platform in decline, superceded by mobile and, surprisingly enough, increasingly challenged by its all-but-vanquished ancient foe, the Mac. To that end, one of my first pieces about Microsoft was about then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s misguided attempt to focus on devices instead of services. I wrote a few years later in Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover: The truth is that both [IBM and Microsoft] were victims of their own monopolistic success: Windows, like the System/360 before it, was a platform that enabled Microsoft to make money in all directions. Both companies made money on the device itself and by selling many of the most important apps (and in the case of Microsoft, back-room services) that ran on it. There was no need to distinguish between a vertical strategy, in which apps and services served to differentiate the device, or a horizontal one, in which the device served to provide access to apps and services. When you are a monopoly, the answer to strategic choices can always be “Yes.” Microsoft at that point in time no longer had that luxury: the company needed to make a choice — the days of doing everything were over — and that choice should be services (which is exactly what Satya Nadella did). Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT made OpenAI The Accidental Consumer Tech Company I have been making similar arguments about OpenAI: they need to focus on the consumer opportunity and leave the enterprise API market to Microsoft. Not only would focus help the company capture the consumer opportunity, there was the opportunity cost of GPUs used for the API that couldn’t be used to deliver consumers a better experience across every tier. I now have much more appreciation for OpenAI’s insistence on doing it all, for two reasons. First, this is a company in pure growth mode, not in decline. Tradeoffs are in the long run inevitable, but why make them before you need to? It would have been a mistake for Microsoft to restrict Windows to only the enterprise in the 1980s, even if the company had to low-key retreat from the consumer market over the last fifteen years; there was a lot of money to make before that retreat needed to happen! OpenAI, meanwhile, is the hottest brand in AI, so why not make a play to own it all, from consumer touchpoint to API to everything in-between? Second, we’ve obviously crossed the line into bubble territory, which always was inevitable. The question now is whether or not this is a productive bubble: what durable infrastructure will be built by eventually bankrupt companies that we benefit from for years to come? GPUs are not that durable infrastructure; data centers are more long-lasting, but not worth the financial pain of a bubble burst. The real payoff would be a massive build-out in power generation, which would be a benefit for the next half a century. Another potential payoff would be the renewed viability of Intel, and as I noted above, OpenAI may be uniquely positioned and motivated to make that happen. More broadly, this play to be the Windows of AI effectively positions OpenAI as the linchpin of the entire AI buildout. Just look at what the mere announcement of partnerships with OpenAI has done for the stocks of Oracle and AMD. OpenAI is creating the conditions such that it is the primary manifestation of the AI bubble, which ensures the company is the primary beneficiary of all of the speculative capital flooding into the space. Were the company more focused, as I have previously advised, they may not have the leverage to get enough funding to meet those more modest (but still incredible) goals; now it’s hard to see them not getting whatever money they want, at least until the bubble bursts. What’s amazing about this overview is that I only scratched the surface of what OpenAI announced both yesterday and over the last month — and I haven’t even mentioned Sora (although I covered that topic yesterday). What the company is seeking to achieve is incredibly audacious, but also logical, and something we’ve seen before: And, interestingly enough, there is an Apple to OpenAI’s Microsoft: it’s Google, with their fully integrated stack, from chips to data centers to models to end user distribution channels. Instead of taking on a menagerie of competitors, however, Google is facing an increasingly unified ecosystem, organized, whether they wish to be or not, around OpenAI. Such is the power of aggregating demand and the phenomenon that is ChatGPT. Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Title: The Autistic Half-Century
URL: https://www.thediff.co/archive/the-autistic-half-century/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In this issue: 2025 has been a good year for valedictory memoirs from some of the 20th century's great executives, like Bill Gates' Source Code and John Malone's Born to be Wired. Gates has a few cameos in Malone's book, as a business partner and investor. One reason the two of them got along pretty well is that they had something in common: each one notes, early in his memoir, that he's autistic, and that his life (and his parents'!) would have been easier if he'd known that earlier. When people talk about "autism," they're describing a wide spectrum of outcomes, including pretty serious disabilities that prevent severely autistic people from living on their own. When they use the term to describe themselves, they're referring to the more benign part—a combination of poor social skills, odd sensitivities (to food, texture, noise, etc.), and the ability-or-compulsion to focus for long periods on very narrow domains.[1] For the purpose of this piece, by "autistic" I'm generally referring to the part of the spectrum where people can hold down jobs and live independently, and not the more severe varieties. This used to be called Aspergers, but that incredibly useful, motte-and-baily-crushing distinction has been deprecated for some reason. This set of traits has existed for a long time; Heraclides of Pontus describes the maritime equivalent of being obsessed with trains in the 4th century BC. Isaac Newton was a vividly weird guy who spent more time on biblical and alchemical studies than on math and physics. (He was also a very literal, subtext-insensitive kind of person; he got a sinecure as Master of the Mint partly because the government wanted to reward him for his academic contributions, but insisted on actually doing the job, hunting down counterfeiters, etc.) One reason to suspect that many public figures have an autistic streak is a two-sided selection effect: they're more often in circumstances where it's natural and normal for them to do what would otherwise be autistic. Describe Warren Buffett as someone who periodically has six-hour Q&A sessions with complete strangers, and he sounds pretty extroverted, but if you rephrase that as six hours of continuous riffing on a topic that's been his fixation since he was a teenager, and it sounds more like an autistic person who's been able to arrange his life so it's as autism-friendly as possible. The way I'd think of it is that if there's someone who spends forty hours a week messing around with model trains, they sound pretty autistic. But if you meet that person because you're at a model train convention, 1) it's 100% on-topic for them to start up a conversation with you by talking about model trains, and 2) you're already about 99th percentile for being interested in model trains, so they just don't look that weird to you. Similarly, lots of the people who strike up conversations with Gates or Malone are people who want to talk about their special interests. And when they were doing deals for set-to boxes and equity injections, a maximum-bandwidth bidirectional infodump was probably great fun for both of them. What would someone born with those traits have done if they'd been born a century earlier? There were certainly plenty of careers that reward this bundle of traits. But they were less scalable. Presumably lots of mildly autistic people sorted themselves into more solitary, systematized career tracks, and many others were part of the vast majority of people who lived on farms. Urbanization creates opportunities for more specialization, which raises the potential returns of spending basically all of your brainpower thinking about what you specialize in. (The Pattern Seekers is not all that great, but it does mention some anecdotes from the early life of Thomas Edison, who did very well for himself in terms of historical impact and had financial outcomes that weren't too shabby, either. So he was an early beneficiary of this: more cities meant more demand for power plants, lightbulbs, and appliances.) Mass production and capital accumulation raised the returns for people who can think about complex systems, as did logistics networks like railroads—a business where day-to-day management could mean lots of interaction with telegraph machines (Carnegie’s first love, he could understand the incoming clicks by sound alone) rather than human beings, and a field that rewarded people who were good at mental arithmetic and could keep lots of datapoints in their heads. But the period where traits on the spectrum were maximally rewarded probably starts in the 70s, thanks to a series of mostly unrelated developments: The analog world is built around neurotypical preferences. How could it not be? If you hate how bad and loud the music is in various public places, remember that these places are made for the public, and that's basically what the public wants. The digital world is built by and for autistic people, and if you want The Internet to be a place where you spend all of your time reading about Rust, or the Eastern Roman Empire, or certain practical applications of matrix multiplication, you can more or less arrange your online life so these are all mainstream interests. This framing even describes some of the conflicts that modern tech companies have engendered. People complain about The Algorithm showing them rage-bait news, snuff films from Ukraine, scantily-clad women, scantily-clad men, etc. But The Algorithm is, basically, whatever you seem likely to engage with based on your past behaviors and those similar to you. The neurotypical user says "This isn't what I wanted," and the autistically accurate response is "But it's exactly what you asked for." You should expect this to get more common. Autism diagnosis rates have risen over time, so in terms of pure numbers they'll have a bigger impact. Part of the rise of autism is just that we have better diagnostic tools. Malone and Gates probably received informal diagnosis of autism-spectrum disorders on the playground, in the form of being called a "geek" or "spaz" or something, and at least some of the growth of autism as an identification is that it's not as pejorative as it used to be. But it's also quite heritable, so if people with autistic traits start being more likely to have kids together—perhaps because of assortative mating by education, which rose from the mid-20th century through the 90s before declining; perhaps because couples are meeting online;[3] Autistic couples are also more likely to read Bryan Caplan, take him as gospel, maybe run a few monte carlo simulations, and commit themselves to maximizing the net present value of future visits-from-the-grandkids; maybe they nerd out about religion and read-and-reason their way into believing that any form of birth control is intrinsically evil.[4][5] If the material rewards from these traits keep rising, they won't be as economically constrained as other couples: fertility rates tend to be u-shaped with respect to income, and higher within-couple variance lowers the opportunity cost of one parent downshifting their career for a while. The Internet, the more autism-first way of viewing the world, is increasingly interposed between you and the external world. You'll still talk IRL—about things you read about online. You go out to restaurants—that you saw on Google Maps. As smart glasses get more common and interactions with LLMs get more ubiquitous, an increasing share of reality will be filtered through consumer apps, meaning that everything you see will be filtered by an autistic person's idea of what a neurotypical person would like. So, in the end, there's a paradoxical separation that leads to synthesis. Someone who was born on the spectrum a century ago would probably have a slightly worse life because of it, and feel a bit separate from their peers. They might, through effort and luck, construct a wonderful life for themselves, but the world didn't provide a lot of the raw material to make that easy. Today, they're much more likely to get sorted into a peer group in which they're comparatively normal, and to be able to filter out some of the rough textures and annoyances of a 50th-percentile life. But in another sense, all this separation makes them more integrated with society than they've ever been. A disproportionate share of the software and hardware I used to write this article, and that you're using to read it, was produced by people on the spectrum. You are, in some tenuous but meaningful sense, interacting with all of them. And, mercifully, you aren't even attempting to make eye contact. An obvious question you might have here is: "Hey, Byrne, are you autistic?" I actually don't know, and at this point in my life I don't think it would be especially useful to spend time and money to find out whether the answer is "almost" or "slightly" or whatever. If I run down the list of symptoms, there are plenty of familiar ones, but then you run into the incommensurable life advice problem: maybe noticing when other people are bored by or annoyed with me is just as hard for everyone else, and I'm just lazy. On the other hand, it's pretty heritable, and one of my kids did get a formal diagnosis (of the interesting-tradeoff variety rather than the crippling-disability kind), and I've never had a serious relationship in which I wasn't asked if I was actually autistic. It is pretty helpful to know where on the spectrum your kids are, especially if your sense of a normal level of interest in human beings relative to objects and abstractions is not quite average. The lining/stacking-up-objects thing, for example, is real. For kids, the utility of a diagnosis is that they aren't able to arrange their life in an autism-friendly way, but their parents can, especially when they can wield a doctor's note to teachers and other authority figures. For adults, the main reason to care is that if you have some autism-spectrum traits, it's helpful to look up the full list in order to learn which other traits you have that, unbeknownst to you, are not actually universal. ↩︎ In addition, financing these shakier companies meant that there were economic rewards to coming up with clever restructuring plans when the bonds inevitably went sour. The First Junk Bond is a book-length treatment of the various financings, restructurings, exchanges, etc., that just one company, Texas International Co., went through in the early days of junk bonds. If you get a kick out of figuring out how to value an oil-denominated bond, or you have a photographic memory for who owns how much of which bond issue and which of those owners might either owe you a favor or accept an owed favor as compensation for a haircut on the value of their asset, you'd thrive in this environment. The upstanding and eminently clubbable gentlemen who ran the largest banks just couldn't compete. ↩︎ This one also probably selected more for autistic-autistic pairings in the pre-swipe era, when cameras weren't as good and a text-centric approach worked best. It will be interesting to see if autism rates are lower for children of the cohort that met after Tinderizing online dating apps A/B tested better than anything else. ↩︎ Granted, they might get equally into David Benatar instead. Societies develop cultural antibodies to antinatalism over time, for the obvious reason that any society that doesn't ceases to exist. Which means that you can safely refuse to engage with any particular antinatalist argument unless you happen to find it funny. If they're wrong, it's just a live look at something that's born a historical curiosity, since eventually anyone susceptible to these ideas won't leave descendants behind. And if they're right, well, central nervous systems first evolved half a billion years ago, so a few extra generations of meaningless suffering doesn't move the needle. ↩︎ Also, this is a long and accidental version of the Selfish Gene, where on-the-spectrum traits that would make someone in the 13th century feel a lot more at home living in a monastery—following a rigid schedule, adhering to a written list of rules, reading and writing theological tracts all day—now contributes to conferring a fertility advantage on the same set of genes. ↩︎ You're on the free list for The Diff.

Diff Jobs works with companies across fintech, hard tech, consumer software, enterprise software, and other areas—any company where finding unusually effective people is a top priority. OpenAI has modestly adjusted its projected cash needs through 2029, to $115bn from $35bn ($, The Information). AI bearishness takes two forms: the demand-side argument that the products just aren't that great and will never be that big a business, and the supply-side argument that AI is amazing but the space is too crowded and overcapitalized for anyone to make money. This update is actually net worse for the first argument, but helpful for the second: the reason OpenAI's projected losses are rising so fast is that their revenue numbers are rising fast. Every time revenue goes up, there will be another set of inputs where scale effects mean they're worth doing in-house. OpenAI had no business owning fabs or power plants a few years ago, or designing their own chips, but if doing that today means getting the compute and the power they need to meet the future demand they expect, then it's worth it. This shifts costs earlier in time, because it's creating a fixed cost to replace a variable cost. So far, OpenAI's growth is answering the demand-side question quite nicely, but they'll need to set a lot more scaling records to justify another $80bn in spending to get there. ASML has become a big strategic investor in Mistral. This is very fun from the perspective of commoditizing the complement: if there are more AI labs, there will be more demand for GPUs, and probably more skunkworks projects to develop custom chips. If some of those competing companies are open-weight, the factor that determines marginal cost for the cheapest models will be purely on the hardware (and power) side. So ASML is doing what it can to ensure that demand for the most semiconductor capital equipment is as high as possible, but also that the end market is as fragmented as possible. Anthropic has settled a class-action lawsuit for $1.5bn over their decision to pirate some of the half-million or so books they trained on. This works out to about $3k/book, or what a typical author would get if they moved another thousand or so copies of their book after having earned back their advance. This actually seems reasonably fair. Just as a ballpark, the collective very partial attention of all of the users of an LLM seems like it would be equivalent to selling around that many extra copies of a book. As AI companies get bigger, there will have to be more refined ways to think about how to split the upside from people providing training data, but there's a possible model where LLMs end up being an active subsidy for very niche writing, because it will have a hard time finding its audience in bookstores but can't help but find that same audience in the context of an LLM chat session. So far this year, 231 companies have gone public in the US, and 7 in the UK ($, FT). Which raises the question: how global should the stock market really be? Within countries, there's typically consolidation in listing venues over time; trades happen where there are already other trades happening. On the other hand, even within the US that leads to some frictional costs, and the financial industry professionals on the West Coast who get to the office before 5am might fondly wish that a few of the trillion-dollar West Coast-based companies they track were listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange, with West Coast hours, instead. That problem is a lot harder if Japanese and market professionals have to work the night shift to trade Japanese stocks. So there's still some regional gravity for exchanges. But many of the biggest companies in a given country are multinationals, and if the investor base is English-speaking and assets tend to get managed from the US, it's generally easier for these companies to have a US listing. So the same cultural and economic ties that make UK-based companies bigger than they'd otherwise be have, over time, turned the London Stock Exchange into something closer to a regional exchange. One of the drivers of private equity's growth is that they can lever up at the company level, and have a bunch of higher-volatility bets with capped downside, which makes their portfolio perform better. Levering a company is economically similar to owning an option on in, with the strike price equal to the value of the debt, and if that's combined with streamlining a company to focus on a narrower business, it can lead to some exciting returns (and a few blowups). but public markets can do that, too, and there's been a burst of spinoffs lately ($, WSJ). Because of how low fees have gotten and how liquid the assets in question are, diversification is cheaper for most investors than making single-name bets, which means the right structure for the market is have diversification at the portfolio level and to make each individual stock as focused and idiosyncratic as possible.

Title: Lenovo LOQ 15 Gen10 review

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model. PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know what my biggest bugbear is for budget laptops? It's the screen. It is always the screen. For some reason, notebook manufacturers seem to have this almost obsession with pairing massively underwhelming graphics cards with panels that would put most 4K TVs to shame. It's madness. Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case. You gain very little by doing that. Thank the dear and fluffy lord Gabe Newell then (he doesn't have anything to do with this, I don't think, I haven't checked), that Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 ditches that seemingly age-old laptop manufacturer mantra in favor of a more practical GPU and screen pairing instead. At its core, the Gen10 comes complete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, a Ryzen 7 250, and, more importantly than that, a simple, elegant, beautifully crisp and punchy 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 IPS display, running at around 144 Hz. And it does all of that with a sub $1400 price point. Now, yes, I know what you're thinking, technically, no, that graphics card isn't really a "true" RTX 5060. I mean, it sort of is, so far as the name's the same and the core RTX Blackwell architecture matches it as well, but it's lost about 15% of its CUDA cores, and a not-so-subtle 12% of everything else, (ray tracing cores, ROPs, TMUs, Tensor cores, you know, all the good stuff that makes DLSS 4, kinda, work). Heck, I suppose we should be thankful it still touts that same 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Model No: 15AHP10CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 250GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060 115WRAM: 16 GB DDR5-5600Storage: 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen Size: 15.6-inch IPSRefresh Rate: 144 HzResolution: 1920 x 1080Battery: 60 WhrDimensions: 15.6 ~ 23.9 mm x 359.9 mm x 258.7 mm | 0.94 x 14.17 x 10.19 inchesWeight: 2.3 kg | 5.07 lbsPrice: $1,389 | £1,300 The good news, though, is that on the whole, that mobile RTX 5060 does actually deliver when it comes to 1080p gaming. Most titles easily averaged well into the 60 fps mark and above, the only exception, of course, being Cyberpunk 2077 without any DLSS support (which still achieved a relatively respectable 36 fps). Chuck on DLSS Quality and the beautiful silky goodness that is MFG, and that too climbs well into the 100s. It's so refreshing to be able to just game at your native resolution on a laptop at this price point, without having to worry about dialling the graphics preset down, or swapping around resolutions and getting stretched pixels or worse. Plus, that 15.6-inch screen is already delivering a pixel density greater than a 32-inch 4K panel does. Alrighty. Stop the press, cancel the review, clearly this is the best gaming laptop of 2025, right? Isn't that right, tiny human? Well, just hang on one minute. It's not all sun-lit uplands and frame rates. We need to talk about the storage and memory setup on this thing. Because, to be blunt. It sucks. In its default configuration, the one I'm testing here, the LOQ 15 comes with a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 at 5,600 MT/s. Do you know what Ryzen loves more than memory frequency? Memory bandwidth. There are times, particularly when loading programs, running multiple applications, or intense, high-load activities, when you almost feel this stuttering effect occur on the Gen10. There's a lag as you attempt to move an application across the screen or open up Task Manager. It's chilling to be blunt, giving Windows Vista vibes, and I don't like it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For an additional $65, Lenovo will pop an extra 16 GB stick in there for you, but to be honest, this should've been two 8GB dual-channel sticks to begin with, retaining that budget price point. At least so you're not left wondering if the whole system's locking up because you just opened Paint, or because your memory setup sucks. Again, on the SSD front, it's similarly just not good enough. The stock model is a SanDisk WD Blue SN5000S, QLC affair, not too dissimilar from the WD Blue SN5000 I reviewed late last year. That's fine, nothing particularly wrong with that for a budget unit. At least, that is, until you see the capacity. It's a 512 GB model, which once Windows is installed, sits at around 370 GB of total available space. I couldn't even install our entire benchmarking suite in one go; it was that small. I had to test games, then delete them and install other games and then test those… Again, Lenovo will happily pop in a 1 TB variant, but for an additional $60 added on to the price tag, which should've been included as standard, given it's a gaming laptop. My list of mild grievances continues with the battery life, which petered out at just 89 minutes. Although that is better than some of the more premium, more power-hungry units out there, the LOQ is generally hampered by its relatively small 60 WHr battery and AMD's relatively power-hungry Ryzen 7 250 CPU. Now, I've been harsh here, I have. This is a budget notebook, effectively. It can't all be brilliant at the end of it all, and there is still a lot to love about it, far beyond that of just the screen being the right pick for that graphics card. CPU performance is impressive, even with that single-channel memory, and it beats out other RTX 5060 notebooks like Gigabyte's Gaming A16 in average fps too, that one in particular featuring an Intel Core i7-13620H (a damning indictment of Intel's currently poor Ultra line gaming performance, it'd seem), which is nothing to sniff at. And the overall build quality of this thing? Purely outstanding. It is a gaming notebook; you can tell that from the get-go, there's no hiding that. There are angles and edges, embossed logos, and a jutting webcam divot, among other things, along with a whole host of I/O ports protruding out of its bottom. But it's not ostentatious. There's a suaveness to it, from the "luna grey" metallic satin finish to the heft and bulk of the thing. It feels solid, yet remains sleek, like it's designed for even the most aggro of esports streamers to wail on after they go 0-3 in competitive. I've played around with laptops four times the cost of this thing that pale in comparison when it comes to the build quality on show here, and that's not nothing. ✅ You don't mind the upgrade path: There's no denying it. The single-channel memory and 512 GB SSD on the base model are massively underwhelming. If you don't mind spending a little extra or can upgrade the two, then the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a fine choice for 1080p gaming. ❌ You're looking for something with a bit more flair: Aside from the above, the LOQ is very much a marmite style. You'll either love how subtle it is for a gaming notebook or despise it. If you're looking for something a little flashier, this ain't it. Cooling is impressive as well, and throughout my time testing, temps rarely got over 70 degrees, even under intense loads. Yes, fan noise is a thing, particularly when it's plugged in, but it's all manageable in Lenovo's Legion app, which, although relatively barebones, does a good enough job of managing noise in exchange for heat, which again you've got a good 20 degrees to play with. There are, of course, your state-mandated AI apps integrated in here as well, requiring Lenovo account sign-up and more, along with the usual intrusive McAfee anti-virus pre-install to be aware of, but from a software perspective, that's about it for bloatware. Elegant. Sophisticated. Well paired. Dialled in to a T. Yet flawed. That is what the LOQ 15 represents. With resplendent gaming performance and a sleek, sharp design that eschews the usual "gamer" nonsense in favor of sophisticated style instead, it's a laptop that checks a lot of boxes. Yet, it's not without fault, and although it entertains well enough, it could've been far, far better if only Lenovo had tweaked that entry-level model's configuration first. Still, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find an RTX 5060 notebook that packs as much punch as the LOQ 15 does into that price, and for that, I doth my hat to you fine Lenovo, you have done well. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model.
