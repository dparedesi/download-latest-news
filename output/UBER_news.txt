And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. Speaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter.

A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents. The shift represents a massive threat to AWS, which holds a firm grip on the lucrative startup ecosystem. More on Cloud 2.0.

Title: These Beloved Fast Food Chains Are Losing Their Edge In 2025, According To Customers
URL: https://www.mashed.com/1994565/beloved-fast-food-chains-getting-worse-2025/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T16:33:00Z
Full Content:
The success of a fast food chain often depends in equal parts on nostalgia and change. On one hand, a fair number of, say, McDonald's customers are perpetually chasing the taste of a Quarter Pounder from their youth. On the other hand, virtually all leading fast food companies continually keep their menus fresh with limited-time offerings or updated recipes, ensuring there's always a new reason to visit. Domino's even overhauled its pizza recipe entirely in the late 2010s and never looked back, permanently altering its flagship offering. Sometimes change is helpful, like in the case of Domino's. But, occasionally, a major change or series of changes at a fast food chain is so detrimental that the classic, nostalgic experience is pretty much lost. In 2025 alone, more than a handful of beloved fast food chains have changed for the worse and started to lose their edge, according to online comments from customers. Isolating the most significant fast food chains declining in 2025 first meant identifying chains with a pronounced downturn, as opposed to a years-long, persistent lull. Furthermore, since the price of fast food is up across the board, complaints from customers needed to cite more than just higher prices. Based on those criteria, then, the following are all popular fast food chains that customers think have lost their edge. Signs that Wendy's was struggling were apparent by the end of 2024, and plenty of customers started to notice those struggles affecting the quality of the Wendy's experience the following year. Pivotal to the chain's decline — and something that started to become evident in 2024 — has been a decrease in the quality of the food. Customers have noticed classic items like the Baconator and the Vanilla Frosty, among others, tasting worse than they remember. Another common critique of Wendy's restaurants is that they're insufficiently staffed. Issues with understaffing recounted by customers in 2025 have included closed drive-thrus, odd hours, and an inefficient ordering system. One Reddit user posted about a series of Wendy's closures in their area, all roughly within the last year, and theorized this was ultimately the fault of the chain no longer delivering on the higher level of quality for which it was once known. "I don't know what the quality control at Wendy's is, but in my opinion, they need to start reigning in the franchises and really look at how the food is getting made," they wrote. "[Wendy's] has always been the more expensive fast food option versus McDonald's or Burger King, but for that price, you used to be guaranteed a certain quality. When the quality is gone, there's really no reason to go there instead of the cheaper option at McDonald's." While the consensus among customers that Wendy's is struggling is a relatively new phenomenon, the decline of Pizza Hut has taken place on a considerably lengthier timeline. Pizza Hut was disappearing across the country in 2020, for example. Nevertheless, things have only gotten worse for the chain in 2025. In response to a post about a particularly low-quality stuffed-crust pizza, for example, a former Pizza Hut manager on Reddit claimed that the chain's dough, cheese, and sauce recipes all changed for the worse in or around 2025. Perhaps even more notable to the Pizza Hut story, however, is the fact that the chain switched from in-house delivery drivers to partnerships with third-party delivery apps in 2025. Many customers are unhappy about this change, generally preferring the experience of dealing with a local Pizza Hut store employee over DoorDash or Uber Eats systems. Even former Pizza Hut employees are denouncing the chain and warning other potential customers away. "As a former Pizza Hut delivery driver, because they gave us two days' notice before they told us they were going 100% DoorDash, I agree," wrote a user on Reddit, in response to a critique of the new DoorDash system. Chipotle has always been a little divisive. For its proponents, items like the burrito bowl make for a fast, largely affordable, and relatively healthy lunch. But to the chain's critics, there are some secrets Chipotle doesn't want the public to know. Some of these suggest a business that doesn't always live up to its own ethos. As much as Chipotle has always faced criticism, some noteworthy changes to the company have negatively affected its 2025 trajectory in particular. Emblematic of Chipotle's 2025 struggles, to the extent it inspired a dedicated Reddit thread, was a significant stock price drop in July. Near the end of 2024, Chipotle hired a new CEO, and some commenters blamed him for the chain's downturn. One analysis of his impact suggested that a purported push to increase Chipotle's volume of catering orders was energy best spent elsewhere. More impactful, this analysis suggested, would be increasing portion sizes. Portion sizes decreasing was, indeed, a complaint shared in numerous posts commenting on the stock price drop. "I was a near-daily Chipotle guy for 10 years," wrote one Reddit user. "Not only did the meat quality nosedive, but as others have mentioned, the portion size reduced by about 33%. I'm done with Chipotle." Like Chipotle, Chick-fil-A elicits strong feelings, both from fans of the chain and those who claim there are better chicken sandwiches at competing restaurants. While Chick-fil-A may cycle limited-time offerings in and out of its rotation, it's the regular chicken sandwich, basic waffle fries, and even its signature chicken nuggets that keep customers coming back — all simple, year-round staples. But as much as Chick-fil-A is reliant on its steadfast classics, some customers are noticing that, classics though they may be, they're just not hitting like they used to. Chick-fil-A made two notable changes to its most popular items. First, in 2024, the chain replaced its antibiotic-free chicken with chicken it describes as raised with no antibiotics important to human medicine. Whether or not that change is resulting in lower quality chicken is up for debate, but regardless, a fair number of Chick-fil-A customers have found that its chicken has gone downhill. Then, in 2025, the chain altered its fry recipe. The big difference compared to the old fries is that the new style of fry is coated in pea starch, intended to keep an order crispier for longer. While that does seem to be working as intended, plenty of fans of Chick-fil-A's classic waffle fries are straight up unhappy with the new recipe's flavor. "Literally tastes like oil, they stick together, and it's not even worth heating up. I'd rather take the soggier ones than what they did this time around," wrote one Reddit user. Around the start of 2024, there were already signs that Panera Bread might not be around much longer. The issues the soup and sandwich chain was facing at that time seem to have only gotten worse, given the volume of customers who noticed the quality drop off in 2025. In a Reddit thread about overrated fast food chains, for example, the two comments with the most upvotes — more than twice as many as the third-most upvoted comment — mentioned Panera. While customers have found that Panera has been steadily declining over the years, the chain announced in July of 2025 that it would no longer prepare its own fresh dough. For those who were already starting to feel iffy about the state of Panera in 2025, this decision was just about the opposite of what the chain needed to win back some goodwill. "Panera's initial concept was that there was a lack of neighborhood bakeries in the U.S., particularly in suburban areas," wrote one Reddit user. "That concept is long gone. There's nothing that makes products at Panera better than elsewhere. You can get similar products in so many places. Sometimes the grocery store selling pre-made sandwiches is in the same strip mall, and it's just as good and cheaper." Sonic Drive-In is sort of a black sheep in the fast-food chain restaurant world. While most fast food chains have a signature item or items, there's no single must-have at Sonic. Rather, it's the chain's old-school drive-in concept that it's most well-known for. Indicative of Sonic's 2025 decline is the fact that some Sonics have closed down the drive-in stalls at times, instead urging customers to order in the drive-thru. A price reason for Sonic's 2025 trajectory is unclear, but that trajectory has been clear enough to inspire multiple online discussions about a sudden lack of quality Sonic restaurants. It's not just the drive-in experience that has been impacted, either. Customers have reported issues with Sonic's food, ranging from overcooked burgers to excessively sweet drinks to drinks being watered down. "I'd like Sonic if it would build its products right," wrote one Reddit user. "Every time I go, all the stuff is on one side of the main item. Like a chili cheese dog with half the wiener exposed. Full serving of chili and cheese falling off the other end. A burger with a patty in the middle of the bun, but half the patty naked and the other half with full portions of everything. It doesn't matter how slow it is or which location I go to." The same way In-N-Out is a business in which Californians take pride — even if its footprint technically extends to a handful of additional states — Whataburger is a Texas chain through and through. Discussion of Whataburger's decline kicked off in a major way around the end of 2024, when The Dallas Observer published an article agreeing with a December Washington Post piece suggesting that Whataburger had fallen off. That sentiment persisted into the following year. Texans recounted issues with the chain in 2025, ranging from cold food to excessive wait times to insufficiently portioned ingredients. Its fries in particular garnered significant criticism — the chain's burgers are cooked to order, sometimes leaving an order of fries to sit out for some time. Even if this practice may have affected orders in the past, customers have shared that in 2025 in particular, subpar fries started to become increasingly common. "Lifelong Whataburger diner here — I am 61," one Reddit user posted. "In my last couple of experiences have noticed a different taste. Last night, I had French fries that were "rubbery," not crisp or fresh like the kind that you find at In-n-Out. I am so disappointed that I want a refund." California has In-N-Out, Texas has Whataburger, and Chicago has Portillo's. From famously delicious hot dogs to Italian beef sandwiches to a famed chocolate cake shake — made with a blended chocolate cake slice — Portillo's specializes in indulgent favorites from Chicago and the Midwest. In 2025, Portillo's attempted to expand significantly outside of Chicago with restaurants smaller than the average Chicago location, focused on quick service. That plan fell so short of expectations, Portillo's parted ways with its CEO in September. Amidst this discord and its inevitable financial impact, customers have noticed the quality of the food at Portillo's locations dropping off. One customer, for example, noted that the size of its Italian beef sandwiches is shrinking. Other customers have noticed that items like the beef and cheddar croissant pretty much never include adequate cheese. "Now every time I go, they always mess up my order, sometimes the cheese on my beef and cheddar croissant isn't even melted," wrote one Reddit user. "I've watched my bag just sit on the counter, ready to get pushed out, while other people are getting theirs. Just not the same anymore."

In a sector traditionally dependent on manual processes and long procurement cycles, AI is introducing automation and intelligence to optimize sourcing, pricing, and logistics. Predictive analytics powered by AI helps businesses forecast demand, manage inventory efficiently, and prevent stockouts or overproduction, crucial in the perishable goods segment. AI-driven recommendation engines are also enhancing personalization in B2B platforms, suggesting products based on purchasing history, seasonal trends, and client-specific needs. This level of customization strengthens supplier–buyer relationships and increases conversion rates. In pricing, machine learning algorithms dynamically adjust prices based on demand patterns, competitor data, and raw material costs, improving profitability and competitiveness. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants simplify order management, automate customer support, and streamline negotiations, reducing operational burdens for distributors and wholesalers. B2B Food and Beverages E-commerce Market Value Chain Analysis 1. Supplier & Inventory Sourcing This stage involves onboarding manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers who supply raw materials, packaged foods, beverages, and HoReCa essentials. Platform operators vet suppliers for pricing transparency, reliability, and product compliance (e.g., FSSAI, HACCP). Data-driven demand forecasting helps maintain optimal inventory turnover and reduce wastage. Value capture lies in exclusive supplier partnerships, private-label sourcing, and integration with ERP systems to ensure price and stock accuracy in real time. 2. Digital Platform Operations & Order Fulfillment This is the core value-creation layer, where the platform facilitates catalog management, dynamic pricing, payment processing, and data analytics for bulk buyers like restaurants, retailers, and institutions. Efficient AI-driven demand matching, real-time stock visibility, and automated reordering enhance buyer retention and supplier efficiency. Investments in cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and omnichannel integration ensure scalability. Value is generated through transaction commissions, subscription fees, and digital marketing services offered to suppliers. 3. Distribution & Last-Mile Delivery The logistics stage ensures timely, temperature-controlled, and cost-efficient delivery of orders to B2B customers. Some players operate hybrid models, managing both their own fleet and third-party logistics (3PL) partners for regional reach. Integration with cold-chain systems, route optimization, and warehouse automation reduces spoilage and delivery times. This stage’s value capture depends on logistics reliability, fulfillment speed, and service-level efficiency, which drive platform loyalty and repeat business.

Title: Diane Keaton, Her Own Brand; Jennifer Meyer Jewelry at 20; Spring 2026 Runway Accessories to Try Now

WrapStyle: Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own Diane Keaton was not defined by any fashion brand, she was her own. Jennifer Meyer’s trailblazing L.A. jewelry business at 20. Moncler’s epic Robert De Niro and Al Pacino campaign. Spring 2026 runway accessories to try now and Native American designer Jamie Okuma’s must-have moccasins. Diane Keaton had personal style the likes of which we may never see again, not just because she was a singular creative, but because of the celebrity-fashion industrial complex we’re now living in. Keaton, who died Saturday, showed that there could be power in covering up, even in Hollywood; made androgyny approachable and whimsical; and later found a distinctive uniform that was eccentric yet controlled — structured suits, turtlenecks, long skirts and coats, gloves, hats and wide belts in black and white. Although she wore designer clothing over the years — Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and Thom Browne, to name a few — and modeled in a J.Crew campaign, Keaton wasn’t defined by any one brand. She was her own. If you can find it (it’s sold out nearly everywhere now), Keaton’s coffee table book “Fashion First” explains how she started experimenting with clothing from an early age, often altering Goodwill finds, then eased into her 1970s style with “Annie Hall,” before finding her uniform in the 2000s. It covers the what and the how of her style, but sadly is light on the why. Still, it’s full of fun photos, some of them hilariously annotated. “Someone please help me!” Keaton writes of a 1980s fashion don’t. There were no stylists, no glam squads, just her. And she owned it, for better or worse. The fashion scene in Los Angeles certainly has changed over the last two decades. Back in 2005, magazines like Us Weekly and In Touch were the chroniclers of celebrity style and the engines of discovery for brands. Jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer was perfectly suited to harness the power of Hollywood having grown up in it as the daughter of industry vet Ronald Meyer. Celebrating 20 years in business, she threw a party last week to celebrate her relaxed brand of luxury jewelry to layer and live in, and there was so much good will, even her ex Tobey Maguire showed up. The crowd mingling over wine and canapés in Meyer’s Brentwood home was a testament to how much L.A. has grown into a fashion business capital, with Erin and Sara Foster (Favorite Daughter), Tina Chen Craig (U Beauty) and Andrea Lieberman (A.L.C.) among those who have built brands here by tapping into L.A.’s entertainment and creator economy. “When she had this idea, I remember thinking, OK, good luck,” Sara Foster said. “She’d sit in the back office of her house all day designing and bagging samples. And then it just snowballed. I don’t wear her jewelry because she’s my best friend of 25 years, I wear her jewelry because you can sleep in it, but you also get stopped in the street because someone is desperate to know what that piece is. That’s the sign of a real jewelry designer.” Meyers’ first celebrity fan was Jennifer Aniston, who wore her Gold Leaf necklace in the 2006 film “The Break-Up.” “It didn’t break the Internet because the Internet wasn’t booming. But it broke Us Weekly and InStyle and from there, she wore all kinds of pieces I couldn’t keep in [stock],” Meyer said. “Courtney Cox’s hoop earrings were in InStyle, which came out monthly then. People were just waiting for it so they could see what to buy,” she said of early-aughts tabloid fashion culture. Meyer’s 18-karat Good Luck charm, which features all the good luck symbols—an elephant, evil eye, Om, horseshoe, four-leaf clover, and heart—has been another key piece, worn by Rihanna, Alicia Keys and many guests at the party as well. “Sometimes people come up to me on the street to tell me about their good luck, how they gave it to their daughter and she got pregnant, all these great stories,” Meyer said. Still, she’s as surprised as anyone to still be at it. “I invested hardly any money, there was no overhead, so the risk was minimal. And I wasn’t scared,” Meyer said of starting out. “I was just thinking you know what, let’s see how this goes and suddenly it’s 20 years later.” Next year, she’s looking forward to reopening her store at Palisades Village. “I can’t wait to bring business back,” she said. “L.A. is an amazing community, and we really come together, especially when people are in need.” One of the biggest trends from the Spring 2026 runways was, in fact, jewelry, which seems strategic during an economic slowdown. Costume jewelry typically has lower price points than apparel and leather goods which could help draw in some of the aspirational shoppers that have been fleeing luxury brands in recent years, scared away by relentless price hikes. I love getting a jump on the next season by shopping things in my closet, on The RealReal, or wherever, and mimicking runway looks. A white button-down shirt, à la Chanel, has already been moved to the front of my closet. I’m also ready to dive back into my jewelry box like it’s the early 2010s, when Jenna Lyons at J.Crew and Michelle Obama in the White House were setting the trend with statement pieces. One thing I’ve already dusted off is a 1980s enamel and rhinestone bow-shaped brooch I bought at the Paris flea market. Inspired by Tory Burch’s runway styling (see above), I pinned it to the collar of a polo sweater. Dig up those island souvenirs, too, because Burch also had a ton of seashell pendant necklaces, also seen at Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Versace and Dries Van Noten. This Celine tailored “neckmess” as they say, is already one of the most shared Spring 2026 images on fashion Substack. I love the juxtaposition of the global beads and the white suit jacket, and it’s easy to replicate. Silk scarves were also a fun trend at Celine, as seen below. “Why don’t you tie one to your leather-bound agenda?” as Diana Vreeland would say. For the first time in a while, Hermès sent its famous (and relatively affordable) silk scarves down the runway, styled in several ways, including at the neck intertwined with diamond necklaces—a look I plan to try with a thin chain. The luxury brand also showed a scarf bag, which has to cost less than a Birkin, right? Statement earrings are back too—the bigger, the better—from chandeliers at Saint Laurent to vintage-style flower clip-ons at Chloé. At Balmain, ropes of shell beads blurred the line between necklace and top in the coolest way. All of it converged in the Chanel collection where the fire coral necklace was a favorite. Brooches, big earrings and ropes of beads were here, too. The message? Just start piling it on, you can’t go wrong. Speaking of Chanel, newly-minted ambassador Ayo Edebiri has already stepped out in one of the best looks from designer Matthieu Blazy’s Spring 2026 runway debut. She wore the gown (with a slight modification, the bow moved to the other shoulder) to the premiere of “After the Hunt” in London and looked like a dream. In other brand news, fans of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s feminist-centered, commercially-minded work at Dior can now follow her to Fendi. Ending months of speculation, the designer is heading home to Rome as the new chief creative officer for the Roman fashion house. There are so few female directors of luxury houses, so it’s good to see her back at the top. We’ll see if she can strike gold twice at a Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy-owned brand—and how similar or different her vision will be from Dior to Fendi. With Jonathan Anderson’s Dior skewing much younger, it could be an opportunity for Fendi to pick up the lost Dior generation. In one of the all-time best celebrity campaigns, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are now modeling for uber-luxe outerwear brand Moncler. Titled “Warmer Together,” the campaign features the Hollywood titans, who have been friends for 50 years, wearing Moncler puffers in cinematic black-and-white photos by Platon, including the choice shot above of the duo gazing at the Manhattan skyline. The advertising blitz includes photos and short films, and is running across outdoor, web and social, so you’ll be seeing a lot of it. There is also a newly recorded rendition of Bill Withers’ “Lean on Me” by Moncler ambassador Tobe Nwigwe, as part of the campaign. Pacino and De Niro have appeared in multiple films together throughout their long friendship, including “The Godfather: Part II,” “Righteous Kill,” “The Irishman” and more. “Warmth was never about the outside. It was always about what was happening on the inside,” De Niro says in the teaser film, his voice like a warm cup of cocoa on a winter day. “Friendship is the greatest thing you can have,” Pacino adds. Getting these two together is a flex for CEO Remo Ruffini and Moncler, which saw more than $1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025. The born-in-the-Alps brand has been looking to the U.S. for growth and will show its Fall 2026 collection in the Hollywood winter haven of Aspen on Jan. 31, 2026. It’s sure to be celeb-packed: Moncler’s last show in snowy Courchevel drew dozens of stars, including Jessica Chastain, Adrien Brody and Anne Hathaway. Native American fashion designer Jamie Okuma has dressed Lily Gladstone and Jessica Matten for the red carpet, is a finalist for the 2025 CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund and her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian among other institutions. Now, fresh off her New York Fashion Week debut, Okuma has a new collaboration offering a taste of her museum-worthy beadwork at an accessible price point. The gorgeous Manitobah x Jamie Okuma Modern Moc Chukkas ($260) are decorated with floral beadwork designed by Okuma, who is Shoshone-Bannock and Luiseno based in La Jolla, Calif. The design is inspired by her grandmother’s artistry (there’s a long line of creative gifts in the family; Jamie’s mom, Sandra Okuma, is also a renowned artist) and the traditional styles of her tribes in the Great Basin and Plateau regions. Manitobah is a Métis-founded Canadian shoe company that has funneled more than $1 million back to Indigenous artisans, supporting communities and preserving traditions through education, employment and collaboration. The drop is part of the Manitobah Artist Series, which brings in creatives to craft products that honor their stories—from sketch to marketing campaign. The floral Chukkas are limited edition, and Okuma has a lot of serious fans, so they’ll go fast, but there is a possibility of a future restock according to Manitobah reps. Meanwhile, the ready-to-wear collection Okuma just showed at NYFW is available on her website. Prada has been somewhat quiet retail-wise in Southern California in recent years compared to its luxury peers, but the Italian brand just opened a new 5,000-square-foot store at Westfield Topanga. The boutique features an illuminated façade in the brand’s iconic pastel green with a repeating triangle pattern echoing the brand’s logo. Inside, the black-and-white checkered marble floor pays homage to the original Prada store in Milan’s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The Topanga store has the full run of men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, Re-Nylon outerwear, the new Prada Explore handbags, the latest fall shoes and more. It’s the latest arrival at Westfield Topanga, which opened three years ago to cater to the monied West Valley — aka Kardashian Country. In that time, the shopping center has added 62 new stores — Hermès, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana and Rolex, to name a few — and now boasts the largest concentration of luxury retailers in L.A. County outside of Rodeo Drive. Maybe it’s time for a “Valley Girl” reboot! Forwarded this newsletter?Subscribe here to get WrapStyle directly every week! Have a news story for our readers?
