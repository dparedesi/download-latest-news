Donald Trump matters a lot to Mzansi and the rest of the world right now. Trump is changing the way America works – and how the world’s most powerful country deals with the rest of the world. We’ll track what he does and connect the dots to your daily life. Trump falls asleep during major health launch President Donald Trump looked like he was falling asleep during a major health announcement at the White House. During a televised event on Wednesday, Trump struggled to stay awake while his health boss, Dr. Mehmet Oz, explained how the US government plans to upgrade the healthcare system using tech, apps, and artificial intelligence. As Oz spoke about diabetes, weight-loss plans, and using QR codes to manage prescriptions, Trump kept blinking slowly and closing his eyes. He looked like he wasn’t following a word. The video quickly went viral. “Trump is fighting for his life to stay awake,” joked one journalist on X. Another user wrote: “Was he up all night golfing?” But the sleepy moment came during a big shift: Americans will soon be asked to move their health records to private platforms linked to companies like Google, Amazon and Noom. These apps will read lab results, track medical progress, and even suggest diets using AI. Officials say the data will stay private and only be shared with permission. Trump didn’t respond to questions at the end. Image source: File South Africa offers cash, gas, chickens but Trump won’t budge South Africa is running out of time to stop massive US tariffs, despite offering billions in trade and investment. With just days to go before a 30% tax hits SA exports to the US, government officials say they’re still waiting for real feedback from Washington. South Africa has put a major deal on the table, including nearly R60-billion in local investment into US industries like mining and recycling, a 10-year gas import agreement, and easier access for US poultry and blueberries into the SA market. In return, it’s asking the US to scrap harsh tariffs on sectors like agriculture, shipping, and small business exports. But the US hasn’t responded, and the deadline is Friday. If nothing changes, South African exports will take a big hit. Already, car and steel exports have dropped by 30%. Citrus farmers warn their fruit could go unsold, News24 reported. Talks hit a wall over Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), which some US officials oppose. Trade Minister Parks Tau says SA has “put its best foot forward,” and a crisis plan is now being prepared. Only five countries have made deals with the US so far. South Africa says it’s ready, but the clock is ticking. Image source: File Trump turns on Israel over Gaza starvation Donald Trump has told Israel to open the gates and “let every ounce of food” into Gaza, admitting for the first time there is “real starvation” in the region. The US president made the comment during a messy 70-minute press conference at his Scottish golf course, where he met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump directly contradicted Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who called reports of starvation “a bold-faced lie”. Trump replied: “Look at the kids. That’s real starvation. You can’t fake that.” He said Israel must do more to let aid through, while blaming Hamas for not releasing hostages. He also claimed the US and allies would set up “walk-in food centres”, but gave no details. Meanwhile, Trump said he was losing patience with Putin and gave Russia 10–12 days to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire before new sanctions kick in. He praised Starmer but told him to “cut taxes” and “get tough on immigration” if he wants to win the next UK election –comments likely to annoy Downing Street. Outside Trump’s golf course, protesters waved Palestinian flags and called him a bully. One said, “If it was my grandchildren starving, I’d want people to speak up too.” Image source: File Trump’s caddie drops the ball – literally 🚨🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⛳️ #WATCH — A caddie was seen dropping a ball for President Donald Trump during his Scotland golf trip. Did he make par?pic.twitter.com/HgKuzHFXHa Donald Trump was caught in a cheeky golf moment during his visit to Scotland, and social media isn’t letting it slide. A video shot from a nearby building shows Trump arriving at his Turnberry golf course in a cart. As he pulls up near a tricky spot on the fairway, one of his caddies walks ahead and drops a ball on the grass. A few seconds later, Trump steps out with his club and strolls straight toward it. “Who needs talent when you’ve got a personal ball-dropper?” joked one X user. Another wrote, “Him and Kim Jong Un would be an unstoppable team.” The video popped up just hours after Trump met with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen at the same course. Together, they announced a massive $1.35-trillion trade deal between the US and EU. Turns out, a sneaky golf ball placement gets more clicks than global economics. Image source: File Trump named in Epstein files but White House says it’s “fake news” The White House is denying reports that President Donald Trump was told in May that his name appears in files linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The Wall Street Journal says Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump, telling him the documents included hundreds of names, including his, but that it didn’t mean he did anything wrong. Trump later said he was never told. A White House spokesperson called it “fake news,” while Trump’s team blamed “criminal leakers and the liberal media.” Trump had promised to release Epstein-related files during his campaign, but supporters are now angry that no “client list” has come out. The FBI says no such list exists. A judge this week refused to release grand jury records from Epstein’s 2006 Florida case, saying it would break secrecy laws. Meanwhile, Congress is trying to force the justice department to hand over files, and to make Ghislaine Maxwell testify from prison. Maxwell, jailed for helping Epstein traffic underage girls, says she’ll decide after a meeting with the justice department. Democrats say the Trump team is covering up. Even some Republicans are joining efforts to get the files released. Trump once called Epstein a “friend” but says they fell out in 2004. Image source: File Trump wants to punish South Africa over links to Russia A US committee just passed a Bill that could worsen America’s relationship with South Africa. The “US-South Africa Bilateral Relations Review Act of 2025” calls for a full review of ties between the two countries, and possible sanctions on top ANC and government officials. The Bill passed by 34 to 16, mostly supported by Republicans, and now heads to the full House. If it becomes law, the Trump administration must look at whether SA has harmed US interests, and name any leaders guilty of corruption or human rights abuse for possible US travel bans. The Bill says South Africa is close to America’s enemies, Russia, China, Iran, and even Hamas. It also slams SA for accusing Israel of genocide and pushing anti-Taiwan policies. The Bill’s sponsor, Republican Ronny Jackson, has strong links to pro-Israel donors. But top Democrat Gregory Meeks called the Bill “heavy-handed” and said it would hurt long-standing US-SA ties. South Africa’s foreign minister said diplomacy is the way forward, and denied any anti-white violence. The ANC says the Bill is politically motivated and ignores decades of shared struggle and partnership. Image source: File Trump wants minerals from Africa and a place to send migrants US President Donald Trump met five African leaders at the White House last week. It was a surprise, since Trump doesn’t usually focus on Africa. The countries he chose. Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Gabon, all have oil, gas, and rare minerals. Trump said the US wants to move from giving aid to doing trade. He even shut down the US aid agency, USAID. But trade wasn’t the only thing on the table. Trump asked the leaders to help with immigration by taking in people the US wants to deport, including asylum seekers and criminals, while their cases are still being processed. The leaders talked up their mineral wealth. Trump, not knowing Liberia speaks English, told its president he had “beautiful English.” Experts say Trump wants to lock down mineral deals and maybe find new places for US military bases in Africa, especially after Niger kicked them out. But sending migrants to poor countries won’t be easy. One analyst said instead of dumping people, the US should help African countries build jobs so their youth don’t risk dying trying to leave. Image source: File Trump demands peace but Putin won’t back down in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t seem surprised or shaken by Donald Trump’s latest threats. Trump, who once promised to end the war in 24 hours and improve US-Russia ties, has now sent weapons to Ukraine and warned Russia of heavy sanctions if there’s no peace deal in 50 days. Putin had hoped for better ties with Trump but always made it clear that his main goal was victory in Ukraine. Kremlin insiders say Trump’s shift is disappointing, but not unexpected. A former official said, “Putin always cared more about the war than friendship with Trump.” Trump grew frustrated after six calls with Putin led nowhere. He joked that after each “nice” call, Melania would point out another bombing. Putin’s forces have been stepping up attacks, using drones and missiles to hit Ukrainian cities, the Guardian reported. Still, Moscow isn’t giving up on Trump. Russian insiders believe he’s emotional and might change course again. With over 100,000 Russian soldiers dead, Putin wants a clear win. Peace, he says, will only come if Ukraine agrees to stay neutral and gives up land. Far-right voices in Russia now say a full clash with the US is likely, and may already be underway. Image source: File Trump posts fake AI video of Obama being arrested in Oval Office Donald Trump reposts AI-generated video depicting Barack Obama being arrested. pic.twitter.com/r7dBKjHrAB US President Donald Trump posted a fake video showing former president Barack Obama being arrested by FBI agents in the Oval Office. The video, made using AI, shows Obama in handcuffs and being dragged away while Trump watches. Trump posted the video on his Truth Social platform with the words: “No one is above the law.” There was no warning that the video was fake, and many people who saw it believed it was real. Trump has often attacked Obama and claims that Obama’s government worked to destroy his presidency. Trump has also said that he wants to jail his political enemies if he wins a second term. His post comes shortly after Tulsi Gabbard, the US intelligence chief, accused Obama’s team of starting the “Russia hoax” to make Trump look bad after his 2016 election win. No evidence has been shared publicly, and Obama has not responded. The White House has not commented on the video. Image source: File Doctors reveal Trump has blood flow disease in his legs The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump has a condition that affects blood flow in his legs. Doctors found that the 79-year-old US president is suffering from something called chronic venous insufficiency. It means his veins are not working properly, and blood is not flowing back to his heart like it should. The condition was found after Trump had some swelling in his lower legs. A White House doctor checked him and said it’s not life-threatening, but could become painful or disabling if not treated. Experts say the disease happens when vein valves are damaged or weak, causing blood to leak backwards and collect in the legs. Symptoms can include swelling, pain, cramps, itchy skin, varicose veins and even wounds that don’t heal. It’s most common in people over 70, but can also affect pregnant women, overweight people, or anyone who stands or sits too long without moving. The White House said Trump does not have any blood clots or blocked arteries, which is good news. His doctors have told him to wear special stockings and keep exercising to improve blood flow. On the same day this news came out, Trump also told his Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all secret grand jury files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. Image source: File Trump’s 30% tariff could kill 100,000 South African jobs US President Donald Trump’s new 30% import tax on South African goods could destroy around 100,000 jobs in the country. South Africa’s Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said on Wednesday that the agriculture and car-making industries will be hit the hardest. Speaking on radio station 702, Kganyago said the agriculture sector could suffer badly. “Farming employs many low-skilled workers. The new tax will hit products like oranges, grapes and wine,” he said. He also raised the alarm about South African car exports, which have already dropped by more than 80% after Trump started taxing imported cars in April. “If we don’t find other solutions, we could lose up to 100,000 jobs,” he warned. South Africa already has one of the world’s highest unemployment rates. The official jobless rate is 32.9%, and the broader rate is over 43%. Farmer groups say the new taxes will also hurt macadamia nut, fruit juice and ostrich leather exports. In the citrus industry alone, about 35,000 jobs are at risk. The new tariffs could destroy small towns like Citrusdal in the Western Cape that depend on fruit exports to the US. Image source: South African Reserve Bank Top Trump ally turns on him over Epstein case One of Donald Trump’s closest allies, Mike Johnson, now says the truth about Jeffrey Epstein must come out. Johnson is the Speaker of the House – a powerful job in the US. He says the US government must show the public all the files it has on Epstein. Epstein was a rich man who was arrested for trafficking underage girls. He died in jail in 2019. Many people don’t believe the official story that he killed himself, and they think powerful people who were involved with him are being protected. Trump had promised to make everything public. But now he says people should stop focusing on Epstein and has called the case “boring”. That has made many of Trump’s Maga supporters very angry. They believe Trump broke his promise. Johnson said: “We need to put it all out there and let people decide.” He also asked Trump’s top lawyer, Pam Bondi, to explain why she once said Epstein’s “client list” was on her desk, but hasn’t released it. Trump said Bondi can decide what files to release, but Bondi refuses to talk about Epstein. She says she’s focusing on fighting drug dealers and human traffickers. Many Maga supporters are now turning on Trump. Some are burning their red Trump hats in protest. Image source: File Trump’s wife tells him to stop being soft on Putin Donald Trump has admitted that his wife, Melania, has influenced how he deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said that after having “pleasant” conversations with Putin, Melania would scold him. “I come home and say, ‘I had a great talk with Vladimir today,’ and she says, ‘Really? Another city in Ukraine just got bombed.’” Now, Trump has changed his tone. He warned Putin that Russia has 50 days to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine or face tough new tariffs. He also announced that the US will send more weapons to help Ukraine, Daily Star reported. Melania, who was born in the former communist country of Yugoslavia and grew up in Slovenia, has strong views about Russia’s war in Ukraine. She says she remembers what it was like living under a communist government and often reminds Trump of the suffering in Eastern Europe. Even though Melania no longer lives full-time at the White House, Trump said they speak often and that she “knows what she’s talking about”. Trump’s warning to Russia comes just months after he called Putin “crazy” and begged him to stop bombing Ukraine. He said if no peace deal is reached in 50 days, he will hit Russia and its trade partners with heavy tariffs. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke to Trump on the phone this week and that they agreed to speak more regularly about how to end the war. Image source: File Trump crowns himself as ‘Superman’ Donald Trump has shared an image of himself as Superman, complete with muscles, a tight suit, and a cape. The AI-generated picture, posted on the official White House social media page, shows Trump’s face on a superhero body and includes the words: “THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP.” The post is part of Trump’s ongoing efforts to present himself as a strong leader ahead of the 2026 elections. He’s often said he’s the only one who can save America, and now he’s using superhero-style images to back it up. But not all his supporters are happy. Some MAGA followers have started burning their red hats in protest after the White House said there would be no further public release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Videos online show frustrated Trump supporters setting their caps on fire. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump’s army using robot animals to protect air bases Donald Trump’s US military has deployed robot coyotes to guard air bases as part of his push to use high-tech tools to protect Americans and look tough doing it. The fake animals are designed to scare away birds and other wildlife that could damage fighter jets or cause crashes during take-off and landing. They’ve been rolled out at major US air bases after successful trials. Each robot is shaped like a coyote, a wild animal similar to a jackal, and rides around on wheels like a remote-controlled guard dog. Coyotes are natural predators of many smaller animals, and their presence is enough to keep birds from settling near runways. The US Army’s research team developed the cyborg coyotes alongside the Department of Agriculture. The goal: protect expensive aircraft and military crews from bird strikes and animal interference. The move fits with Trump’s image-heavy military style. He often talks about “peace through strength” and has supported flashy defence projects involving space weapons, military parades and giant spending plans. Officials say the robot coyotes may soon be upgraded with cameras, sensors, and even artificial intelligence. Image source: @armenberjikly Trump bragged he threatened to bomb Moscow and Beijing in secret talks Donald Trump told private donors that he once warned Vladimir Putin he would “bomb the s*** out of Moscow” if Russia invaded Ukraine. The comments were caught on new recordings from Trump’s presidential campaign. Trump claimed he told Putin directly: “If you go into Ukraine, I’m gonna bomb the s*** out of Moscow.” He said Putin didn’t believe him but added, “10% was enough.” The recordings are featured in a new book called 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America. Trump also claimed he gave the same warning to Chinese president Xi Jinping, threatening to “bomb the s*** out of Beijing” if China attacked Taiwan. “He thought I was crazy,” Trump said in the recording. “But he believed me 10%. That’s all I needed.” Despite saying he could end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours,” Trump has failed to stop the conflict since returning to office. This week, he announced more US military support for Ukraine after talks with Putin made no progress. In the same recordings, Trump said student protesters supporting Palestine should be kicked out of the country. “Throw them out,” he said. “That will stop it.” He also bragged about pressuring a rich donor into giving him R460-million, saying the man originally only wanted to give him R18-million. The White House and the Kremlin have not yet responded to Trump’s comments. Image source: File Trump says no more delays for new tax on South African goods US President Donald Trump says that new, higher taxes on goods coming from other countries, including South Africa, will start on 1 August. He says there will be no more delays or changes. Trump had already put a 10% tax on imports from almost every country back in April. Then in July, he said some countries would be taxed even more, but he paused those increases. Now, he says the bigger taxes will go ahead as planned. In messages sent to leaders around the world, Trump said countries like South Africa, Japan, South Korea and others will face taxes of between 25% and 40% on goods they send to the US. He also warned that if any country hits back with their own taxes, the US will raise its taxes even more. Trump said this will bring in lots of money for the US. His finance minister said the US could make more than $300-billion from these taxes by the end of the year. Trump says the taxes are meant to fix “unfair” trade deals. But some people are worried the plan will make goods more expensive and cause problems between countries. The US has only made a few new trade deals so far, with the UK, Vietnam and China. Talks with other countries are still going. Image source: File Trump hits South Africa with 30% tax on all goods US President Donald Trump is putting a 30% tax on everything South Africa sends to America – and it starts in August. Trump has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa and other world leaders, saying it’s time to stop what he calls “unfair trade”. He says South Africa has had an advantage for too long by using trade rules that favour it and not the US. The tariff will hit South African products being sold in America. Ramaphosa tried to get Trump to back down, but it didn’t work. Trump says the US trade deficit (when a country imports more than it exports) is a threat to both the economy and national security. He also warned that if any country tries to fight back, he’ll raise the tariffs even more. Ramaphosa has responded, saying Trump’s view of trade between the two countries is simply wrong. Image source: File Trump slams Elon Musk for starting new political party Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk on social media, calling him a “train wreck” who has “gone off the rails.” The US president spoke just after Musk announced he’s launching a new political group called the “America Party.” Trump said third parties don’t work in the US and only cause “chaos.” He claimed the system is built for two major parties and accused Musk of trying to disrupt the country when there’s already too much division. He also said Musk is upset because Trump’s new tax-and-spending bill removes the electric vehicle (EV) mandate – a rule that would’ve pushed more people to buy EVs. Trump says Americans should be able to choose between petrol cars, hybrids or electric vehicles. He added that Musk had backed him before, even though Trump was always against the EV mandate. The president also said Musk once asked for a friend to lead NASA, but that person turned out to be a Democrat who had never supported Republicans. Trump said that was a red flag, especially because NASA works so closely with SpaceX, Musk’s company. Trump ended by saying his job is to protect the American people. His comments follow Musk’s announcement that the “America Party” will contest elections starting in 2026. Musk said the new party will break the power of the two-party system by focusing on a small number of key seats. Though Musk was born in South Africa and cannot run for president himself, he has been vocal about wanting political change. In a poll he ran on social media, two-thirds of voters backed the idea of a new party. Musk said that was enough to launch it officially, saying the country needs “freedom from the one-party system.” Image source: File Trump celebrates new bill and says UFC fight is coming to the White House Donald Trump has kicked off 4 July celebrations by bragging about his new tax-and-spending bill, and announcing that a UFC fight will take place on the White House lawn. Speaking at a rally in Iowa, Trump said: “There could be no better birthday present for America” than the passing of his new bill, which makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent and increases spending on the military and border security. But the bill also cuts healthcare and food support for low-income Americans and will add $3.3 trillion to the US budget deficit over 10 years. During the rally, Trump also said he plans to celebrate America’s 250th birthday (in 2026) with a national state fair and a live UFC championship fight for up to 25,000 people at the White House. “Dana [White, UFC boss] is going to do it. We have a lot of land there,” Trump said. He also mocked Joe Biden, repeated false claims about a stolen election, and attacked Democrats. “I hate them. I really do,” he said. “Because I believe they hate our country.” Trump hinted at a softer stance on immigration, saying farm workers could stay in the US if their employers vouch for them. “We don’t want to remove workers from the farms,” he told supporters. Image source: File America admits Iran’s nuclear sites weren’t ‘obliterated’ like Trump claimed The US Pentagon has admitted that Donald Trump exaggerated when he said he had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites. A spokesperson for the Pentagon, Sean Parnell, said the real damage from the US airstrikes probably only set Iran’s nuclear programme back by one or two years, not destroyed it completely. This comes after Trump celebrated the bombing of Iran’s Fordow site, calling it a huge win and saying the country’s nuclear programme was “completely and totally gone.” But intelligence officials have avoided using Trump’s word “obliterated.” At a press conference, Parnell repeated the word, but admitted that Iran could rebuild in time. “We believe the facilities were heavily damaged,” he said. “But their programme may only be delayed by a year or two.” The bombs used, called “bunker busters”, are designed to hit deep underground. But Iran’s nuclear knowledge and tech were not destroyed. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran still has the skill to restart the programme. “You can’t destroy the knowledge,” he said. Trump had also claimed that the bombing helped him get a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, calling it the end of the “12-day war.” But fighting restarted the next day, with both countries blaming each other. The Pentagon is now pushing back against media reports that the strike wasn’t as successful as Trump claimed. Parnell accused journalists of using “false and incomplete” information to make the military look bad. Image source: File Trump says Israel is ready for Gaza peace deal Donald Trump says Israel is now ready to agree to a peace deal with Hamas to end the war in Gaza, a war that has already killed nearly 60,000 people. In a post on his Truth Social page, Trump said: “Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-day ceasefire.” He added that during that time, the US will try to help all sides reach a full peace agreement. Trump said that Qatar and Egypt, two countries helping to mediate, would now deliver the “final proposal” to Hamas. So far, neither Israel nor Hamas has officially responded to Trump’s announcement. It’s not clear exactly what Israel has agreed to. In the past, similar ceasefire talks have collapsed quickly, with both sides accusing each other of breaking deals, especially around prisoner swaps. Still, Trump seems confident. Speaking to reporters, he said a deal could be reached as soon as next week and that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. “We want the hostages out, and we want the war to end,” Trump said, the Guardian reported. Hamas has said it is willing to release the remaining hostages in exchange for a deal to end the war. Israel, on the other hand, says the war can only stop if Hamas gives up all weapons and control, something Hamas has refused. Trump is trying to use momentum from the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire and the joint US-Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites to help secure peace in Gaza. He also warned Hamas not to miss this chance. “It will not get better, it will only get worse,” he said. Trump’s announcement came just after an Israeli airstrike hit a café in Gaza on Monday, killing between 24 and 36 people, including children, according to reports. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Since then, more than 56,500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly the entire population of Gaza has been displaced. Much of the area has been destroyed. Image source: File Trump says Elon Musk would be “back in South Africa” without US money Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk, saying he only became rich because of US government money, and without it, he’d be back living in South Africa. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Elon may get more help from the government than any person in history. Without that, he’d probably have to close his businesses and go back to South Africa.” Trump said there would be “no more rockets, no more satellites, no more electric cars” if the government stopped giving Musk support. He added: “We’d save a fortune.” This comes after Musk complained about Trump’s new tax plan. The plan removes money and support for electric cars and clean energy. Musk said cutting this support would be “very bad” for the country. Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, has been getting a $7,500 (R133,000) tax break for each car sold. But Trump’s plan would stop that. Tesla is also expected to report poor sales this week. Trump reminded people that he never supported forcing people to buy electric cars. “Electric cars are okay, but no one should be forced to drive one,” he said. Trump also said Musk supported him for president, even though he knew Trump didn’t like electric vehicle laws. Image source: File Trump says he’s found ‘rich buyers’ to take over TikTok Donald Trump says a group of very rich people are ready to buy TikTok’s US operations, but they’ll need permission from China before the deal can happen. Speaking to Fox News, Trump said: “We have a buyer for TikTok. I think China will probably approve it.” He added he would reveal who the buyers are in about two weeks. The US government has been trying to force TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app’s American side or face a total ban. The deadline to make the deal is now set for September 17. TikTok is still very popular in the US, especially with younger users. Trump has even said it helped him connect with young voters during the 2024 election. But the big problem is TikTok’s algorithm, the smart technology that decides what videos people see. It’s protected by Chinese law and is listed in China’s official tech database, which means it can’t be sold easily. China has said before that it might block any sale, especially if it involves the algorithm. And Trump’s tough stance on China, including new tariffs earlier this year, has made things even more difficult. Image source: File Trump posts “Daddy’s Home” video after NATO boss calls him daddy 🎶 Daddy’s home… Hey, hey, hey, Daddy.President Donald J. Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands. pic.twitter.com/asJb5FD2Ii Donald Trump just posted a video of himself at a big NATO meeting, using Usher’s song “Daddy’s Home” as the soundtrack. Yes, really. The clip shows Trump walking around the NATO summit like he’s the star of an R&B music video. The words “Daddy’s Home” flash across the screen as Usher’s hit plays in the background. It comes after NATO boss Mark Rutte bizarrely called Trump “daddy” during a press meeting earlier this week. Rutte was trying to describe Trump’s wild rant about Israel and Iran, where Trump said: “Let them fight for a few minutes, it’s easier to stop them.” Rutte jumped in with: “And then daddy has to use strong words to stop them.” Not “Dad.” Not “President.” Just “daddy.” People online quickly slammed Rutte, calling it a clear case of sucking up to Trump. Even Trump joined in the joke, telling reporters: “Daddy, you’re my daddy.” Now the White House has made things even worse with the video, featuring a song that’s full of sexual lyrics. Image source: File Trump turns on spy boss Tulsi over Iran bombing report Donald Trump’s spy boss, Tulsi Gabbard, has been left out of a big security meeting with US lawmakers, and some insiders say she’s now in “the line of fire.” Gabbard was supposed to join top Trump officials in a closed-door briefing with Congress to talk about the recent US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But now she’s suddenly off the list, and people close to the White House say Trump blames her for a damaging leak, the Daily Mail reported. Last week, Trump blasted Gabbard after she said Iran wasn’t close to making a nuclear weapon. He told reporters, “She’s wrong.” Gabbard quickly changed her position, saying Iran could make a bomb “within weeks to months.” But the damage was done. A leaked Pentagon report showed the US bombing may have only delayed Iran’s nuclear programme by a few months, far less than what Trump had claimed. Trump said the sites were “obliterated.” The report said Iran might be able to restart soon. Now, there’s a full-blown investigation into who leaked the report, and some White House insiders say Gabbard could be the one who gets the blame. Trump biographer Michael Wolff said: “Tulsi is in the line of fire. Trump always needs someone to blame.” Even though Gabbard publicly supported Trump and said the attacks destroyed Iran’s facilities, she’s been cut from the team giving the official update to Congress. Trump is furious at media reports saying the strike didn’t do enough. He’s attacking CNN and The New York Times, saying they’re lying to make him look weak. CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand broke the story. Trump posted that she should be “fired and thrown out like a dog.” CNN fired back, saying they stand by her reporting. Image source: File US bombs didn’t stop Iran’s nuclear plans A new report says the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites last weekend didn’t destroy them completely, and may have only delayed Iran’s plans by a few months. US President Donald Trump said after the attacks that the sites were “totally destroyed” and that Iran’s nuclear programme was “obliterated.” But a secret report from the Pentagon now says that’s not true. It says some of Iran’s nuclear machines were not fully destroyed, and that Iran had moved a lot of its uranium before the bombs hit. That means they might be able to restart the programme soon, the Guardian reported. The US used big B-2 bombers and huge “bunker-buster” bombs on three sites, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. But one of the sites, Fordow, is buried deep under a mountain, and the bombs couldn’t reach all the way down. The report says Fordow is likely still working and may be used again soon. Trump posted in all capital letters on his social media: “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!” He’s angry the report got out and says it’s an attempt to make him look bad. But US military leaders are being more careful. One general said the sites were badly damaged, but they are still checking how much was really destroyed. The head of the world’s nuclear watchdog says they don’t know where 400kg of Iran’s uranium has gone. And US Vice President JD Vance admitted they still don’t know where the rest of Iran’s nuclear material is hiding. Image source: File Three people killed in Israel just after Trump announces ceasefire Just hours after US President Donald Trump said the war between Israel and Iran was over, missiles from Iran hit Israel, killing three people. Iran fired six waves of missiles early Tuesday morning, with explosions heard in Tel Aviv and Beersheba. Three people died in Beersheba, according to emergency workers. This happened soon after Trump said he had made a peace deal with Israel and Iran to end the 12-day war. He thanked both countries and said on social media that it was “a historic moment.” But Iran said the fighting would only stop if Israel stopped its attacks. One Iranian official said they had not fully agreed to stop the war. Iran’s last missiles were fired just before the ceasefire was supposed to begin. Over the weekend, the US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran denies building nuclear weapons, but Trump said the goal was to stop them from ever getting one. The US dropped heavy “bunker-buster” bombs on underground sites. After days of bombing, many people in Tehran have left the city. Trump said Iran warned them before attacking a US base and that no Americans were hurt. He said he will push Israel to choose peace. Talks between Iran and other countries are still happening. Qatar helped set up the peace deal, and US leaders like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were involved. Image source: File Iran tells Trump to “bring enough coffins” if you want war An Iranian leader has warned Donald Trump that if the US starts a full war with Iran, they should “bring enough coffins” for their soldiers. This came after the US bombed three of Iran’s nuclear sites using powerful B-2 bombers. Iran is angry and says it will fight back. Ebrahim Rezaei, a top member of Iran’s parliament, said: “Don’t expect us to bury your soldiers. Bring your own coffins.” Tensions are rising fast between Iran, Israel and the US. Many world leaders are calling for peace, but Iran’s army and other powerful groups say they are ready to hit back hard. The US says they don’t want war. Their defence chief said the attack was not meant to kill people, but to stop Iran’s nuclear programme. “This is not about removing Iran’s government,” he said. But Trump is not backing down. On his Truth Social page, he called the attack “a historic moment” and told Iran: “End the war now.” He also warned Iran that if they keep fighting, “there will be peace or there will be tragedy.” Iran says the US helped Israel start a dangerous war and has now made things worse. Some experts warn this could lead to more terrorism and attacks on US soldiers and allies. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump gives himself two weeks to decide on Iran attack Donald Trump says he’ll decide in the next two weeks if the US will join Israel in bombing Iran. This comes as fighting between Israel and Iran enters its second week, with both sides firing missiles and the danger of a bigger war growing fast. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “There’s a chance for talks with Iran. The president will decide in the next two weeks if the US will go to war or not.” Trump has also asked the US military if their biggest bombs, the 30,000-pound “bunker busters”, could destroy Iran’s hidden nuclear sites. He says he wants a peaceful solution but is also ready to use force. When asked what his message is to people who voted for him because they wanted “no more wars,” Leavitt replied: “Trust in President Trump.” Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace, but Trump refused, telling him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Trump is reportedly thinking about attacking Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a hidden base deep underground. So far, Israel hasn’t hit that target, but Trump might. He’s also posted online that Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is “an easy target”, though he says there are no plans to kill him “for now.” Iran has warned the US that choosing war would bring “irreparable harm.” Image source: File Trump says “I may do it” as he thinks about attacking Iran Donald Trump says he hasn’t decided if the US will join Israel in attacking Iran. When asked about it, he gave a short answer: “I may do it, I may not.” He also said, “Nobody knows what I want to do.” Trump believes Iran is in big trouble and says they want to talk. He told reporters that Iran might even come to the White House for talks. But then he also warned that he’s “had it” and wants “unconditional surrender.” Iran’s top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, replied with a warning. He said if the US chooses war, it will cause “irreparable harm.” Iran also said they will not beg or give in to the US. Trump must make a decision soon. US officials say the next 24 hours are very important. Trump doesn’t want to look weak while the fighting between Israel and Iran continues. At the same time, the US has moved warships and planes closer to the region. But the White House says they are only there for defence. Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace between Israel and Iran. But Trump told him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Image source: File People say more pizza orders in the US mean war is coming An online theory claimed that a rise in pizza deliveries near the Pentagon was a secret sign that war was about to break out. But it turns out Pentagon staff were just… hungry. The idea went viral last week as Israel launched major strikes on Iran. A group of internet sleuths, running the so-called “Pentagon Pizza Report”, noticed a spike in pizza orders near the US defence HQ just before the bombs dropped. They told their 100,000 followers: “All nearby pizza establishments have experienced a HUGE surge in activity.” According to them, when Pentagon staff are working late on military plans, they order loads of pizza — and that’s the first clue that something big is coming. But the White House has now shut that theory down. Officials said the US government already knew about the attacks ahead of time — no pizza clues needed. Experts also rubbished the idea, calling it “confirmation bias” and saying there’s no solid proof. The Pentagon does have late-night food available, but they don’t track what staff are eating. So no, America isn’t using pepperoni pizza to signal a strike. Meanwhile, the real news is much more serious. The Israel-Iran conflict is now in its fifth day. Israel has bombed Iranian targets. Iran fired back at major cities. The region is on edge. Donald Trump has jumped in too. After leaving the G7 summit early, he warned Iran’s supreme leader on Truth Social that the US “knows exactly where he is” — but claimed there were “no plans to take him out (kill), at least not for now.” US officials say Trump is also thinking about joining Israel in attacking Iran’s nuclear sites. So while the missiles are very real, the pizza warning system is not. Sometimes a delivery is just dinner. Image source: File Trump leaves G7 early as Israel-Iran war threat grows Donald Trump is leaving the G7 summit early as the fight between Israel and Iran explodes. He’s heading back to Washington on Monday, skipping the second day of talks in Canada. This comes after Trump warned people in Tehran, Iran’s capital, to evacuate immediately on his Truth Social account. Earlier, Israel told parts of Tehran to clear out before bombing military targets. Now, with things getting worse, Trump says he needs to be home to deal with it. The White House said he’ll still attend the G7 photo and dinner before leaving. But his early exit upset other leaders, who hoped the US would help push for peace. A draft statement said Iran must not get nuclear weapons, and that Israel has the right to defend itself. Trump didn’t sign it, but posted, “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” He also hinted he might try to help end the conflict: “They want to make a deal… but I have to leave here.” Meanwhile, Israel is bombing Iranian sites, and Iran is firing missiles at Israeli cities. Iran also warned it may leave the global nuclear treaty. Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, said killing Iran’s top leader would end the war. The US isn’t in the fight yet, but is moving warships and planes closer. The USS Nimitz is heading to the Middle East to join another US carrier, and two destroyers have moved near Israel. Image source: @WhiteHouse Israel ignores Trump’s orders and attacks Iran Donald Trump told Israel not to bomb Iran. They did it anyway. Just hours before the attack, Trump said he didn’t want Israel to go in, warning it could ruin his peace talks with Iran. But Israeli warplanes launched the strike without US support, and without waiting for Trump’s approval. Now Trump is caught in a dangerous situation. His efforts to calm things down with Iran are at risk, and thousands of US troops in the region could be in danger if things get worse. Trump’s top diplomat was preparing for talks in Oman when the attack happened. Trump had already asked Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to hold off. He didn’t listen. Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham cheered the move, but Trump’s not interested in starting new wars. Unlike past presidents, he doesn’t want the US dragged into foreign fights unless America is directly attacked. After the airstrike, the US made it clear they had nothing to do with it. A short statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “Israel acted alone. Our priority is keeping American forces safe.” Image source: File Elon Musk says sorry for going too far about Trump Elon Musk has said sorry to US President Donald Trump after the two had a big fight online. “I went too far,” Musk wrote on X on Wednesday. “I regret some of my posts about President Trump.” Last week, the two were throwing insults at each other. Trump said he might stop giving government money to Musk’s company, SpaceX. Musk, in return, said Trump’s name was linked to the Epstein scandal, something Trump strongly denies. Trump hit back, saying Musk had “lost his mind”. Now, people close to Musk say he’s calming down and might want to be friends again. He even deleted a post where he supported removing Trump from office. Musk’s apology came after Trump warned him: “If he keeps trying to punish Republicans, there will be serious consequences.” But Trump didn’t say what those consequences would be. Earlier this year, there were rumours Trump might sell off his Tesla shares, but nothing happened. Even though things got ugly, Trump has stopped attacking Musk for now. He said he wishes Musk well and wants Musk’s satellite internet company, Starlink, to keep running. Vice President JD Vance said Musk made a “huge mistake” by going after Trump. He called Musk’s angry posts “emotional” and said, “I hope Elon comes back, but maybe it’s too late, he went nuclear.” Image source: File Photos show Trump may be wearing a catheter on his leg Photos of Donald Trump at the White House have gone viral after people noticed a weird bulge in his left pant leg. Many think he might be wearing a catheter, which is a medical tube that drains urine into a bag. The bulge looks like tubing running down his leg. Some say it’s a Foley catheter, which is often used for people with bladder problems. Others shared diagrams of how catheters work and said it matches the shape seen in the photos. A few people suggested it might be a leg brace or just wrinkled pants, but many online are convinced it’s a medical device. Trump has not commented, and his doctor has never mentioned any catheter or health issues like this. Still, the internet is buzzing with rumours about his health based on the pictures. Image source: @patriottakes Trump wants to give R18,000 to every baby born in the US Donald Trump has shared a new idea that every baby born in the US between 2025 and 2029 will get $1,000 (R18,000) from the government. The money will go into a special savings account that grows with the stock market. Parents can also add more money, up to $5,000 a year. Trump says this plan will help kids build money for their future. Big business leaders like the CEOs of Uber, Goldman Sachs, and Dell have promised to add billions more to support this idea. The plan is part of a big new law that Trump calls his “beautiful bill.” It’s already passed in the House of Representatives but still needs to pass the Senate. If it doesn’t pass, the baby accounts won’t happen. Trump says the money for this plan will come from changes to welfare programs and a new tax on money sent out of the country. But a government report says the plan would actually add $2.4-trillion to the national debt and cut healthcare and food help for millions of people. Some experts also say the baby accounts aren’t the best way to invest money, and other savings plans might work better. Still, Trump believes the accounts will give kids a good start in life. Other countries like the UK and Singapore have done similar things before, giving money to kids to help them save early. Trump and his supporters say if this bill doesn’t pass, Americans might face higher taxes. So they’re pushing for Congress to approve it soon. Image source: File Trump sends troops to Los Angeles and says “we’ll be everywhere” President Donald Trump has sent troops into Los Angeles after protests broke out over immigration raids. He warned that “troops will be everywhere” and said he wouldn’t let the protests continue. The protests started after ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents raided a detention centre and arrested a union leader. Police used tear gas and flash-bangs on protesters, and the scene quickly got tense. Trump blamed California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, saying they weren’t doing their jobs. He made fun of Newsom on social media, calling him “Newscum,” and said protesters shouldn’t be allowed to wear masks. Governor Newsom responded, saying Trump was trying to “create chaos” so he could send in more troops and scare people. He told everyone to stay calm and peaceful. Around 300 National Guard soldiers were sent to LA over the weekend to help control the protests. ICE said they would keep arresting people who tried to stop their raids. Image source: @USBPChief Elon Musk and Donald Trump go from besties to enemies Donald Trump and Elon Musk used to be best buds. Now, they’re fighting like two celebs in a bad reality show. It all started when Musk called Trump’s new tax bill “disgusting” and told Americans to call Congress and stop it. He even posted a picture from the movie Kill Bill to make his point. Trump didn’t stay quiet. He fired back from the White House, saying he might cancel Musk’s government deals and cut off his billions in funding. Musk clapped back: “Go ahead, make my day.” Then things got even messier. Musk claimed Trump’s name was in the secret Jeffrey Epstein files. There’s no proof, but Musk’s post went viral. Just a few days ago, the two were all smiles in the White House, with Trump even giving Musk a goodbye gift as he left his short government job at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk also said Trump would have lost the election without him, and called him ungrateful. Trump replied, saying Elon had “turned on him” and only got upset because the new bill cuts tax breaks for electric cars. Musk said he never even saw the bill, and accused Trump of hiding it from Congress. Then Musk joked that Trump must have been replaced by a body double, because he used to say the same things Musk is saying now. Just when you thought it couldn’t get wilder, Trump’s old advisor Steve Bannon said Musk should be deported and investigated, claiming he might be in the US illegally. Image source: File Trump banned travel from a country that does not exist US President Donald Trump is being laughed at online after banning travel from a country that hasn’t existed for over 30 years. Trump signed a new executive order blocking people from entering the US from 12 countries. One of them was “Burma,” but that country officially changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. The full list of banned countries includes Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and others. The White House says the travel ban is meant to keep the US safe. But critics say it unfairly targets certain countries and reminds them of Trump’s earlier “Muslim ban” from 2017, which caused protests and confusion at airports. This new ban comes after a recent attack in Colorado, where an immigrant from Egypt was arrested. But Egypt is not on the list. People online mocked Trump for not knowing that Burma and Myanmar are the same country. Others say the ban is more about politics than safety, and that it could hurt the US’s image around the world. Image source: File Elon Musk calls Trump’s tax plan ‘a disgusting mess’ Elon Musk has slammed US President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending plan, calling it “outrageous” and “a disgusting mess.” The plan, which gives huge tax breaks and increases spending, was passed by Republican lawmakers in May. Trump called it a “big, beautiful bill.” But Musk strongly disagreed. On his social media platform X, he wrote: “This massive spending bill is a disgrace. Shame on those who voted for it.” Musk had been working in the Trump government for a short time to help cut waste and lower spending. His team was called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But last week, Musk quit the role. He said trying to fix problems in Washington was harder than expected. At a press event, the White House brushed off Musk’s complaints. Trump’s spokesperson said the president still supports the bill. Musk warned that the bill would raise the national debt to $2.5-trillion and said voters should remove the politicians who supported it. Musk had big plans to cut $2-trillion in government spending, but only managed $150-billion. He also faced backlash over cuts to foreign aid and clashed with other Trump officials, Daily Star reported. His short-term role in government was always limited to 130 days. That time ended at the end of May. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump misled about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa, says adviser Mark Burns Mark Burns, a US pastor and adviser to Donald Trump, says the former president may have been misled about claims that white farmers are being targeted and killed in South Africa. Burns is visiting South Africa for the first time and says the country reminds him of his home state, South Carolina. In an interview with the Mail & Guardian, Burns said he was surprised to learn from South Africans of all races that most people don’t believe in the so-called “white genocide” narrative. He added that of the over 5,000 murders in the last part of 2024, only 12 were farmers, and just three were white. Burns said he met with white Afrikaner farmers who confirmed crime is a problem but denied being targeted for their race. He believes Trump may change his view if he visits South Africa himself and gets accurate information. Burns described Trump as a “man of peace” who wants prosperity for all countries. He said Trump sometimes reacts to what’s shown to him without knowing the full truth and would rethink things if given better information. He also warned that South Africa’s role in Brics, a group that includes Russia and China, could hurt relations with the US by challenging the US dollar. Burns said this makes trade and negotiations harder. Asked if Trump would attend the G20 summit in South Africa later this year, Burns said he couldn’t speak for him, but he would advise him to come and see the situation for himself. Image source: File Trump claims that Biden is a clone US President Donald Trump has shared a shocking post online that says Joe Biden died in 2020 and was replaced by a clone or robot. The original post, made by someone else on social media, said: “There is no Joe Biden – he was executed in 2020. What you see now are clones and robotic copies.” Trump didn’t comment, but he reposted it on his platform, Truth Social, which made it go viral. Some of Trump’s supporters believed it, saying things like “We always knew something was wrong.” Others pointed out things like Biden’s changing eye colour as “proof” he had been replaced, Daily Star reported. But many people laughed at the idea and called it just another crazy conspiracy. One person wrote, “Do you think the Earth is flat too?” Trump has shared strange claims before. He once said Barack Obama wasn’t born in the US and suggested Ted Cruz’s father helped kill President John F. Kennedy. He’s also supported QAnon and made false claims about the 2020 election being stolen. Despite not having any proof, Trump continues to share these kinds of stories, and some of his fans continue to believe them. Image source: File Trump gives Putin two weeks to prove he wants peace in Ukraine US President Donald Trump has warned Russia’s Vladimir Putin that he has two weeks to show he’s serious about ending the war in Ukraine, or the US will respond differently. At the White House, Trump said: “I can’t tell if Putin wants peace, but we’ll find out in two weeks. If he’s just playing games, we’ll act differently.” Trump has recently called Putin “crazy” and accused him of “playing with fire” after Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine in years. At least 13 people, including children, were killed in Kyiv over the weekend. Earlier, Trump and Putin spoke on the phone for two hours. Trump said the call went “very well,” but no peace deal followed, and Russia kept bombing, BBC reported. So far, Trump’s administration has mostly pressured Ukraine, even pausing military support in March. Critics say this makes Russia feel stronger. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine give up land and that the US recognise Crimea as Russian territory. A Kremlin official said Trump doesn’t understand what’s really happening and blamed Ukraine for attacking Russian cities. Meanwhile, Germany has offered Ukraine longer-range missiles, which Russia says could damage peace efforts. Trump is now focusing on a possible summit with Putin instead of pushing for an immediate ceasefire. But with Russia holding about 20% of Ukraine and peace talks going nowhere, the war continues. Zelensky says Russia is stalling, while Moscow claims a peace plan is almost ready. Image source: File Elon Musk quits Trump team after arguing over government spending Elon Musk has decided to leave his role as an adviser to US President Donald Trump. The billionaire businessman said he’s had enough of politics and is frustrated by how slowly things work in government. Musk, who runs Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), announced on X that his time helping the Trump administration has come to an end. He thanked Trump and said his plan to cut wasteful government spending, called the DOGE mission, will still continue without him. Musk had been helping Trump try to cut down the US government’s budget, but said the system is more broken than he expected. “It’s harder to fix things in Washington than I thought,” he told The Washington Post. He quit shortly after criticising Trump’s new spending bill, calling it too expensive and saying it added more debt. In an interview with CBS, Musk joked that the bill was “big” but not “beautiful,” poking fun at Trump’s description of it. Trump said he’s not happy with every part of the bill, but still supports it overall. Musk had been working part-time for the government since January and helped Trump’s campaign with millions in donations. But now he says he’s stepping away from politics completely and going back to focus on his businesses. “I think I’ve done enough,” Musk said. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes about Trump meeting: ‘I get nervous when the lights go off now’ President Cyril Ramaphosa made a lighthearted joke on Tuesday about his unusual meeting with US President Donald Trump last week. Speaking at an event in Cape Town, Ramaphosa said he now feels uneasy whenever the lights go dim, because of what happened in the Oval Office. During his meeting with Trump, the US president suddenly told staff to turn off the lights and play a video on a TV in the room. The video showed EFF leader Julius Malema singing “Kill the Boer,” a controversial song. The moment caught Ramaphosa by surprise. At Tuesday’s event, when the lights dimmed as he walked onto stage, Ramaphosa joked: “When I saw the room going dark, I thought, what’s going on? Is this happening again?” He laughed and said it reminded him of what happened with Trump. He also joked with journalist Clement Manyathela, who was at both the Trump meeting and the Tuesday event. “Seeing you again gave me flashbacks,” he said, smiling. Ramaphosa said people later told him the Oval Office moment was “an ambush,” but he just found it confusing and unexpected. “I thought we were getting into a good discussion, and then suddenly the lights went out and a video was playing,” he said. Image source: File Russia could attack Europe by 2027 A new report warns that Russia might be ready to attack European countries as soon as 2027, if the war in Ukraine ends or slows down soon. The report, from a top London research group (the International Institute of Strategic Studies), says that a ceasefire would give Russia time to rebuild its army. Even though Russia has lost many tanks and vehicles in Ukraine, it’s already starting to replace them, the Daily Star reported. Experts say that if Russia gets a break from the war, it could rebuild its forces and pose a serious threat to nearby countries like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania within two years. Leaders in Europe, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, have also warned that Russia still has big military goals and may not stop with Ukraine. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said last year, “It’s not a question of if they’ll start another war, but when.” There’s also growing concern about NATO, the alliance that protects many Western countries. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether America should continue to defend NATO countries that don’t spend enough on their military. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump told reporters after returning to office. Experts say that if the US pulls back from NATO, it could weaken the group, making it easier for Russia to act more aggressively in Europe. Image source: File Trump warns Putin that taking all of Ukraine will destroy Russia US President Donald Trump has warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to take control of all of Ukraine, it could lead to Russia’s downfall. In a post on Truth Social on Sunday night, Trump said, “I’ve always had a good relationship with Putin, but something has happened to him. He’s gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said he believes Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine, not just part of it, and warned that doing so would be a huge mistake for Russia, The Guardian reported. Earlier that day, Trump told reporters he was shocked by Russia’s latest attacks on Ukrainian cities. He also said he was now considering adding new sanctions on Russia. “He’s killing a lot of people,” Trump said. “What the hell happened to him?” Trump also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying Zelenskyy was “doing his country no favors” and that “everything out of his mouth causes problems.” He added, “I don’t like it, and it better stop.” Zelenskyy had earlier criticised the US for not speaking out more strongly after Russia carried out its biggest air attack in years. The weekend strikes killed at least 12 people, including three children, and involved nearly 300 drones and dozens of missiles. Despite promising during his campaign to end the war in 24 hours, Trump has not placed new sanctions on Russia, even after it refused a proposed 30-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy’s top aide said more pressure is needed, warning that Russia could continue attacking not just Ukraine, but possibly other countries as well. Image source: File Trump shows wrong photo to claim white farmers are being killed in South Africa During a meeting at the White House with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, US President Donald Trump wrongly said he had proof that white farmers were being killed in South Africa. He held up a picture and said, “These are all white farmers being buried.” But the photo wasn’t from South Africa at all, it was taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It shows people being buried after a deadly attack by rebels near the city of Goma. The picture came from a video made by the news agency Reuters in February. Trump had seen the image in an article on a conservative website called American Thinker, which talked about race problems in both South Africa and the DRC. The website didn’t explain where the image was from, but it linked to the original video about Congo. The Reuters journalist who filmed the video, Djaffar Al Katanty, said he was shocked to see Trump using it in the wrong way. “President Trump used my video from Congo to claim white people are being killed in South Africa,” he said, TimesLive reported. The White House didn’t respond to questions about the mistake. The editor of the blog admitted Trump was wrong about the photo, but still defended the article’s message. President Ramaphosa visited the US this week to improve relations. Trump has accused South Africa of mistreating white people, which the South African government says is not true. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes with Trump: ‘I don’t have a plane to give you’ South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting had some tense moments, but Ramaphosa used humour to lighten things up. When a reporter asked Trump about a $400-million private jet he reportedly accepted from Qatar, Ramaphosa joked, “I don’t have a plane to give you.” Trump laughed and replied, “I wish you did. I would take it.” But the mood turned tense when the reporter asked if taking the plane was ethical. Trump got angry and said, “You’re a bad reporter. You should be ashamed,” and told the reporter they couldn’t ask any more questions. Ramaphosa tried to keep things calm by repeating his joke, which got another laugh. Earlier in the meeting, Trump showed Ramaphosa a video he claimed showed the graves of over 1,000 white farmers in South Africa and handed him newspaper articles. Ramaphosa, watching with no visible reaction, asked where the video came from and responded: “There is crime in South Africa, but most of the victims are Black.” Trump replied, “The farmers are not Black.” Later, when journalists asked how the meeting went, Ramaphosa said, “It went very well.” Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump drops Elon Musk as friendship falls apart Elon Musk is no longer part of the US government team he once helped lead, and it looks like he’s stepping away from politics completely. The tech billionaire has been removed from the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), and many of his businesses have struggled because of his political opinions and ties to President Donald Trump. Trump used to praise Musk often on his Truth Social account, sometimes mentioning him four times a week. He liked Musk’s bold cost-cutting moves, including firing government workers and shutting down departments. But things have changed. Trump hasn’t mentioned Musk at all since early April, and reports say Musk’s influence in the White House is basically gone. One Republican insider told Politico, “He’s done. People don’t like him anymore.” They said Musk’s attempts to act like an average American didn’t go down well, and instead upset voters. Now, people in Trump’s team see Musk as a problem, not an asset. He used to be viewed as a smart outsider who could help fix government, but now he’s seen as too controversial. There hasn’t been an official announcement, but the silence from Trump’s side says a lot. According to The Independent, Trump’s team is quietly pulling away from Musk. Image source: File Ramaphosa lands in Washington for talks with Trump President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Washington DC for an important visit to the United States. He is expected to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Ramaphosa is travelling with several senior government leaders and political figures, including Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen, Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, International Relations Minister Ronald Lamola and South Africa’s new special envoy to the US, Mcebisi Jonas. In a statement earlier this week, Steenhuisen said the visit is both historic and crucial. He explained that his focus is on strengthening trade relations between the US and South Africa, especially in the agricultural sector. He said that maintaining agreements like AGOA is essential to protect jobs, boost the economy and create more employment opportunities. Steenhuisen added that South Africa’s relationship with the United States is extremely important. He warned that losing preferential trade access under AGOA would be a major blow to the country’s economy, especially for farmers and farm workers. The upcoming meeting between Ramaphosa and Trump is expected to address key economic and political issues affecting both nations. Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump to call Putin in push for Ukraine ceasefire US President Donald Trump says he’s ready to speak with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday in a new push to end the war in Ukraine. Trump shared on social media that he’s expecting a “productive day” and hopes to make progress toward a ceasefire. He also plans to speak with NATO leaders. The war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has proved difficult to end, despite Trump’s repeated claims that he could stop it quickly. Trump’s top adviser on the matter, Steve Witkoff, said the president believes a phone call with Putin could “clear up the logjam” and get both sides closer to peace. “I think it’s going to be a very successful call,” Witkoff said. But not everyone agrees with Trump’s approach. Bridget Brink, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, resigned last month, saying the administration has been too soft on Russia and too hard on Ukraine. She said the final straw came in February, when Trump and his team criticised Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House. “Peace at any price is not peace,” Brink warned. “It’s appeasement, and that leads to more war.” Trump said the first call will happen at 10am Monday with Putin. He hopes to stop what he called the “bloodbath” in Ukraine. He also suggested trade incentives might be part of the deal, since Russia’s economy is suffering under US and Western sanctions. Trump posted that he believes this war “should never have happened” and is confident it can be ended soon. Image source: File Ramaphosa and Trump to talk trade, refugees and war President Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21. Their goal is to fix tensions between South Africa and the US. Relations between the two countries have gotten worse since Trump returned to office in January. Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and accused the government of unfairly targeting white Afrikaners through its land reform policies. He also allowed 49 white South Africans to move to the US as “refugees,” claiming they were victims of racial discrimination. South Africa says this is not true. Ramaphosa’s team says that the refugee issue is not the most important topic for the meeting. Instead, he wants to focus on trade, investment, and cooperation between the two countries. He will also speak to Trump about: South Africa says it wants fair trade, peaceful diplomacy, and a balanced relationship with the US. Ramaphosa has invited Trump to visit South Africa later this year for the G20 summit and says he’ll see for himself that the country is peaceful and welcoming. South African officials say they expect the meeting to be respectful, even if the two leaders don’t agree on everything. Image source: File Ramaphosa to meet Trump in the US next week President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21, his office confirmed on Wednesday. The two leaders will talk about important issues between South Africa and the US, as well as topics affecting the rest of Africa and the world. Ramaphosa’s office says the visit is a chance to improve relations between the two countries, which have become strained since Trump returned to power in January. Trump has cut off all US aid to South Africa, saying he doesn’t support the country’s land reform plans or its legal case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. This week, the US also gave refugee status to 49 white South Africans, claiming they face racial discrimination. The South African government says that claim is not true, and Ramaphosa has said the US is misunderstanding the situation. Even though relations are tense, the US is still one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners, after China. Image source: File Saudi Arabia rolls out mobile McDonald’s for Trump US President Donald Trump was given a tasty surprise during his trip to Saudi Arabia this week, a mobile McDonald’s restaurant set up just for him. Trump landed in Riyadh on Tuesday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The two leaders signed several major deals, including a $142 billion arms agreement involving US defence companies. But all eyes were on something else parked nearby, a fully equipped McDonald’s on wheels, brought in especially for Trump’s visit, Daily Star reported. The restaurant served the usual favourites like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, as well as local menu items like the McArabia Kofta, which is served in pita bread. Trump has long been open about his love for fast food. He once ordered 300 burgers to the White House, posed for photos serving food at McDonald’s during his campaign, and starred in a McDonald’s commercial years ago. After attending a funeral in New York last year, he even ordered $200 worth of burgers for his flight home to Florida. Trump once said he prefers McDonald’s because it’s “clean” and he trusts that the food is safely pre-made. According to his biographer, he likes it because he fears being poisoned, and believes McDonald’s food is safer than unknown restaurants. Trump is expected to attend more events in Saudi Arabia before continuing his Middle East tour in Qatar, where reports suggest he may be given a £302 million private jet as a gift from Qatari royals. Image source: @stockbella Trump invites all South African minorities to apply to be refugees The US is now offering asylum to all South African minorities, including Afrikaners, who say they are being mistreated or fear they may be in danger. The US embassy in South Africa announced that people who are Afrikaner or part of a racial minority group in South Africa can now apply to move to the US as refugees. The programme is part of a new order signed by President Donald Trump. To apply, you must: Applicants must complete a form and explain their situation, including how many people are travelling with them and when they’re ready to leave. They’ll be asked what kind of harm they’ve faced, such as unfair treatment because of race, religion, or political views. The first group of people from South Africa has already flown to the US. But in the US, many people are asking why South Africans are being fast-tracked, while thousands of other refugees from war zones, already been approved, are still being blocked. Some lawyers say it’s unfair and may break US law, especially since Trump had earlier stopped refugee resettlement completely. Now, his administration is helping some people while leaving others in danger. A US refugee group said: “Afrikaners are being fast-tracked, while others in desperate need are left behind.” Image source: File Ukraine and Russia may agree to peace talks this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says there could be a ceasefire with Russia as soon as Monday, with direct peace talks possibly happening later this week in Turkey. Zelenskyy shared the news on social media after speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said both sides may meet in person on Thursday in Istanbul. “We’re waiting for a full and lasting ceasefire starting tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said. “There’s no reason to keep the killing going.” Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 2022. This is the most hopeful update in months. Putin has rejected Ukraine’s call for a 30-day unconditional truce but has offered face-to-face talks without preconditions. Donald Trump, who pushed Zelenskyy to accept the offer, posted: “Have the meeting, now!” European leaders, from France, Germany, the UK and Poland, met with Zelenskyy on Saturday and also demanded a ceasefire starting Monday. They warned Russia of tougher sanctions if Putin doesn’t agree. Putin says he wants peace, but only if it leads to a “lasting solution” and not just time for Ukraine to prepare for more fighting. While the US and European countries see this week’s talks as a chance for peace, many remain sceptical of Putin’s intentions. “This could be a first step,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, “but it’s not enough.” If talks go ahead on Thursday, it would be the most serious chance yet to end the war. Image source: File Trump says having an American pope is a ‘great honour’ The new head of the Catholic Church is Robert Francis Prevost, who will now be known as Pope Leo XIV. He was born in Chicago, studied near Philadelphia, and later worked as a missionary in Peru. Trump praised the historic appointment, telling reporters: “To have the Pope from America is a great honour.” Other American leaders also welcomed the news. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, said millions will pray for the new pope, BBC reported. Joe Biden, a devout Catholic and former president, wrote: “Habemus papam – May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois.” Barack Obama congratulated the pope as a fellow Chicagoan, calling it a historic day. George Bush said the news brought “hope” for Catholics in America and around the world. While many political leaders are celebrating, there are signs that Pope Leo may have disagreed with some of Trump’s past policies. A social media account believed to be his once shared posts criticising the Trump administration’s deportations and comments made by JD Vance. The Vatican has not confirmed whether the account belongs to Pope Leo. Image source: @CyrilRamaphosa Iran wants to kill Trump to get revenge, says ex-us official Iran is planning to kill Donald Trump to get revenge for the killing of one of their top generals, says John Bolton, a former US security adviser. In 2020, Trump ordered a US airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military leader, in Iraq. Since then, Iran has promised to strike back. Now, Bolton says Iran has made a kill list, and Trump is number one on it. Bolton also believes he is on the list. “Iran is using gangs in Europe and the US to go after people who speak out against them,” Bolton told Sky News. “They’re trying to find and hurt people like me — and Trump is their main target.” Trump was already the target of an assassination attempt last year in the US. At the same time, Trump says his government is now talking directly with Iran to try and stop them from building a nuclear bomb. “We’re having talks. A deal would be better than the alternative,” Trump said. “But if the talks fail, Iran will be in big trouble.” Iran has not said anything yet about Bolton’s claims, but its leaders have often warned the US would pay for killing Soleimani. Image source: File Trump says letting Russia back into the World Cup might help end the war Donald Trump was surprised to learn that Russia is banned from the 2026 Fifa World Cup because of its invasion of Ukraine. When a journalist asked him about Russia’s suspension during a White House Fifa meeting, Trump said, “I didn’t know that. Is that right?” Fifa president Gianni Infantino quickly explained that Russia is currently banned from international football. “We hope peace will come and they can be readmitted,” he said. Trump then suggested that allowing Russia back into the tournament could be used as a peace incentive. “Hey, that could be a good incentive, right?” he said. “We want them to stop. We want the killing to stop. It’s not even believable.” Trump also claimed that hosting the 2026 World Cup, which will take place across the US, Canada, and Mexico, would bring massive economic benefits. He said it would create thousands of jobs and bring in billions for local businesses. “We’ll make sure it’s safe and successful,” Trump promised. “Everyone coming to the US will have a smooth, easy experience.” The US is also set to host the Club World Cup this June. Trump said both tournaments will be “special” and the 2026 World Cup will be “the best run soccer tournament the world has ever seen.” Image source: White House Trump will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 to leave the US The Trump administration has announced a new program that will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 (R18,000) if they agree to leave the US voluntarily. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says people without legal status can apply through an app called CBP Home. After they leave the country and it’s confirmed, they’ll get the money. This is a change to an app created under President Biden, which helped people request asylum at the US border. Trump shut that down and changed it so the app now helps people exit the US instead. DHS says this approach saves money. Right now, arresting and deporting someone costs the US over $17,000. By offering a $1,000 incentive, the government says it could cut those costs by 70%. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said it’s the “safest and most cost-effective way to leave” and avoid arrest, the Guardian reported. One person has already flown back to Honduras under the program, and more trips are planned. The government claims people who leave this way might have a better chance of being allowed back legally later, but immigration experts warn that this may be false hope. Critics say it’s a trap and could actually make it harder for people to return legally in the future. This plan is part of Trump’s larger push to reduce immigration and encourage “self-deportation”, which means making life in the US so difficult that people decide to leave on their own. Image source: File Trump announces 100% tariff on movies made outside the US President Donald Trump says all movies made outside of the United States will now face a 100% import tax. He made the announcement on his Truth Social account on Sunday, calling foreign-made films a “national security threat.” Trump says countries like Australia and New Zealand are stealing away American film jobs by offering better deals to Hollywood producers. He wants movies to be made in the US again, the Guardian reported. “We want movies made in America, again!” he posted. He also claimed the move is needed to fight “messaging and propaganda” from other countries. It’s not yet clear how or when the new tax will begin, or whether it affects American companies filming overseas. Film production in Los Angeles has dropped nearly 40% over the past 10 years, according to FilmLA. Meanwhile, countries like Australia, New Zealand and others have attracted big-budget movies by offering tax breaks and cash. Image source: File Trump asks for ‘divine dreams’ and makes virgin joke at prayer event Donald Trump held a big prayer event at the White House on Thursday, where religious leaders asked God to give him “divine dreams” and protect him with “supernatural power.” One man even knelt in front of Trump while others raised their hands and sang Amazing Grace. The event marked National Prayer Day, and Trump used the moment to sign a new order creating a group called the Religious Liberty Commission. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt last year, said he believes God saved his life and is now helping guide his leadership. “We’re bringing back religion in this country,” Trump said. Paula White, Trump’s spiritual adviser, led the prayers. She asked God to give him special dreams, wisdom, and strength. She also said the country needs a spiritual reset, with Trump leading the way. Even though Trump has faced many scandals, including a criminal conviction and selling $60 Bibles, many Christian voters still support him. During the event, Trump also made a joke about a belief that saints in Islam receive 72 virgins in Heaven. “What about 38 virgins?” he joked while speaking about a talk he had with Muslim leaders. “They said, ‘That’s nonsense.’” Trump repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and said he’s working to protect religion in America, including setting up a team to fight “anti-Christian bias.” One top advisor, Mike Waltz, was missing. Trump later replaced him due to a scandal over leaked messages. Image source: White House Trump jokes about becoming the next pope Donald Trump this week told reporters that he wants to be the next pope. “I’d like to be pope,” Trump said with a grin. “That would be my number one choice.” Users on social media site X quickly made fun of the comment, with one writing, “First time in history, we will have orange pope.” Others pointed out how the media might have reacted if someone else had said it: “Had Biden said something this stupid, the media and MAGA would have a field day,” Daily Star reported. Trump didn’t name a preferred candidate for the real role, but did mention Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, calling him “very good”. The College of Cardinals is set to meet on May 7 to start voting for the next pope after Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can vote, and 108 of the 135 eligible voters were appointed by Francis. While some cardinals want to continue Francis’s focus on helping the poor and vulnerable, others are pushing for a return to traditional teachings and unity in the church. Trump’s pope comment may have been a joke, but the conclave to choose the real one is expected to be serious, and fast, possibly wrapped up in two or three days. Image source: File Trump moves fast but big promises still not done Donald Trump has been moving fast since returning to the White House. After 100 days, he’s made some big changes, but many of his promises are still not done. Trump says he already fixed inflation, but experts warn that his high tariffs on foreign goods could make prices rise again. He promised to lower energy bills by half, but for now, energy costs have stayed the same. On immigration, Trump has made a big impact. Illegal crossings from Mexico have dropped a lot, and deportations are up. Trump promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war quickly. That hasn’t happened. Fighting is still going on, and there is no peace deal yet. He also promised big tax cuts, like no taxes on tips and overtime pay, but none of those have passed yet. Trump has acted fast on cultural issues. He banned transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports, cut funding to some universities, and pardoned around 1,500 people who were involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump also worked with Elon Musk to cut government jobs, but the savings are much smaller than they promised. In short, Trump has moved quickly on immigration and culture wars, but promises like cheaper energy, lower taxes, and peace in Ukraine are still not delivered, and it’s unclear if they will be. Image source: File Trump says Ukraine may give Russia part of its land US President Donald Trump says he thinks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea to Russia, even though Zelenskyy said just last week that Crimea will always belong to Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump said: “Oh, I think so,” when asked if Zelenskyy was willing to give up the Black Sea region, which Russia seized in 2014, the Guardian reported. Zelenskyy has not yet responded to Trump’s latest comments. But last week, he clearly stated that Crimea is still “the property of the Ukrainian people.” Meanwhile, leaked US peace plans suggest Trump’s team is proposing that Russia keep the territories it captured, including Crimea. Germany’s defence minister called the US plan a “capitulation” and warned it was worse than anything Ukraine could have agreed to a year ago. Even so, Trump said after meeting Zelenskyy at the Vatican that he now has more sympathy for him. “He’s working hard. He wants to do something good for his country.” Trump also criticised Russia for launching new missile attacks after his peace ambassador met with Putin, saying he was “very disappointed.” When asked if he trusts Putin, Trump answered: “I’ll let you know in about two weeks.” Trump added that he believes a peace deal could be signed soon and claimed (without evidence) that the US has already sent Ukraine $350 billion in aid. On another front, Trump said there had been “a little bit” of progress in trade talks with China, despite Chinese officials saying no talks are happening. Image source: Donald Trump Truth Social Trump starts 2028 campaign even though third term is not allowed Donald Trump has started selling “Trump 2028” campaign hats, even though US law says he can’t run for a third term. The red cap, which looks like his usual “Make America Great Again” hat, now says “Trump 2028” and is being sold for $50 (around R1,000). According to the US Constitution, a person can only be elected president twice. Trump already won in 2016 and again in 2024, which means he shouldn’t be able to run again. But Trump told NBC that there may be “ways around” the rule. “I’m not joking,” he said. “A lot of people want me to do it.” Former Republican politician Adam Kinzinger says Trump is ignoring the rules and could create a big crisis if he refuses to listen to court decisions in the future, Daily Star reported. Trump’s second time in the White House has already caused economic problems, with high tariffs on imports and growing tension between countries. Stock markets have dropped, and trade wars have begun. Now, there are signs that Trump might try to calm things down but many believe the chaos isn’t over yet. Trump’s actions can affect the whole world, including South Africa. If he tries to stay in power longer than allowed, it could damage trust in democracy everywhere and hurt global trade and economic stability. Image source: File Trump still cares about Africa, says adviser after aid cuts US President Donald Trump still cares about Africa, even after cutting major aid programmes and raising tariffs, according to his adviser Massad Boulos. In an interview with the BBC, Boulos said Trump “highly values Africa and African people” and denied that the US is planning to close its embassies across the continent. But Trump’s actions have caused real problems. On his first day in office, Trump froze most US foreign aid, which has had a serious impact on health services in Africa. Many HIV treatment programmes were cut, and some countries may soon run out of HIV medication, according to the World Health Organization. Kenya, Nigeria and Lesotho are among the countries affected. The aid freeze also hit cholera clinics. In South Sudan, five children and three adults died after walking for hours to reach a clinic that had shut down. Boulos said the US is reviewing how aid is spent to make sure the money is not being wasted. “We want the money to go to the right places,” he said. He also confirmed that the US is interested in mining resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, especially minerals like lithium, which are used in electric car batteries. Trump’s trade policies have also hit Africa. He recently placed 50% tariffs on imports from countries like Lesotho, before putting those tariffs on hold for 90 days. Lesotho depends on US trade, especially in clothing and textiles. There are also worries about the future of AGOA — a special trade agreement between the US and African countries, first launched in 2000. Trump has not said if he will renew it, and experts think it might end soon. Image source: File Trump says China tariffs will drop but not go away US President Donald Trump says his very high tariffs on goods from China will be reduced but not removed completely. Right now, the US charges a 145% tariff on Chinese goods. China hit back with a 125% tariff on US products. This has started a trade war that’s shaken the global economy. Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said: “The tariffs will come down a lot — but they won’t go to zero,” the Guardian reported. His comments followed a warning from his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who said the current situation can’t continue and both sides need to make changes. Trump said he still wants to keep good relations with China: “We’re doing fine with China. I think we’ll work well together.” The stock market went up after news of possible lower tariffs. China hasn’t officially replied yet, but their media called Trump’s tariffs unfair and warned other countries not to make trade deals that hurt China. Meanwhile, businesses around the world, including in South Africa, are worried that this trade fight will make things more expensive and slow down the economy. Both China and the US are huge trading partners for South Africa. If their trade war continues, it could mean fewer exports, job losses, and higher prices here at home. Image source: File Pope once told Trump ‘he’s not a Christian’ Pope Francis and Donald Trump never had a good relationship, and it all started with a wall. During Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Pope slammed his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico, saying: “A person who thinks only about building walls and not bridges is not Christian.” Trump didn’t take it well. He fired back, saying if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, the Pope would’ve prayed for a president like him, Daily Star reported. The two later met in 2017 at the Vatican. Trump said it was a “fantastic meeting,” but photos told a different story, with the Pope looking miserable next to Trump’s big grin. Things didn’t get better. This year, just months before his death, the Pope again criticised Trump’s mass deportation policies, saying they were built on “force, not dignity” and “will end badly.” He also disagreed with Vice President JD Vance, who said people should look after their own families and countries before helping others. The Pope wrote: “Christian love is not just about looking after people close to you.” Pope Francis passed away on Monday 21 April at the age of 88. Trump is expected to attend his funeral on Saturday. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump says Russia and Ukraine might make a peace deal soon US President Donald Trump says Russia and Ukraine could reach a peace deal “this week”, but gave no details on what that would look like. Writing in all caps on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday, 20 April, Trump said: “HOPEFULLY RUSSIA AND UKRAINE WILL MAKE A DEAL THIS WEEK.” He added that if peace is reached, both countries could start doing “big business” with the US and “make a fortune.” The comment comes after a failed Easter ceasefire between the two countries. Russia said it would pause attacks for the holiday, but both sides have since accused each other of breaking the truce. Trump has recently said that both Ukraine and Russia need to compromise to end the war, which started in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would affect global prices, from fuel to food. It could ease inflation and reduce pressure on SA’s economy, which has been hit hard by rising costs linked to the war. Image source: File Presidency says Trump won’t hold grudge against Jonas The presidency has defended sending Mcebisi Jonas to the US as South Africa’s new special envoy despite an old video where Jonas called Donald Trump a “racist, homophobe and narcissist”. The comments were made in 2020, when Jonas gave a public lecture as a private citizen, not as a government official. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said on Wednesday: “At the time, Jonas was not representing the government. Those views were personal.” He added that Trump isn’t the type to hold grudges. “If he did, half his cabinet wouldn’t be working with him.” Jonas’ job is to fix SA’s diplomatic and trade relationship with the US, which has become tense. Trump expelled SA’s former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool after criticism of his administration, and recently threatened to boycott the G20 summit in South Africa. Magwenya said Rasool and Jonas are different cases — Rasool spoke while in office, while Jonas was just an activist at the time. Jonas also commented this week, saying: “These things happen. People move on.” Image source: File Trump’s trade war with China is bad news for South Africa South Africa got a 90-day break from Trump’s harsh tariffs, but experts say we’re still in trouble. That’s because Trump is now hitting China, one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners — with heavy taxes. And when China’s economy slows down, South Africa suffers too. China and the US buy over 18% of SA’s exports. If demand drops, it means fewer sales, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy here at home. Economist Maarten Ackerman told Mail & Guardian: “Even if the US doesn’t tax us directly, we’re still going to feel the pain.” SA’s farmers and food producers may need to find new markets fast, especially if US buyers stop ordering wine, fruit, or canned goods. To protect trade ties, President Ramaphosa has sent Mcebisi Jonas to Washington as a special envoy to deal with the growing crisis. Image source: File Trump blames Zelenskyy for war after deadly Russian attack Just days after 35 people were killed in Ukraine by Russian missiles — including two children — US President Donald Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for helping to start the war. Speaking from the White House, Trump said that millions of people have died because of three people: Russia’s Vladimir Putin, former US president Joe Biden, and Zelenskyy. He said the war could have been stopped: “Biden could’ve stopped it, Zelenskyy could’ve stopped it, and Putin should never have started it,” Trump told reporters, Sky News reported. He also said Ukraine made a mistake by going to war with a much stronger country: “You don’t start a war with someone 20 times your size and hope people give you missiles,” he said. The comments came just after two Russian missiles hit the city of Sumy during a Palm Sunday celebration. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Ukraine this year, and over 100 people were injured. Zelenskyy has called for help from the world. Russia claimed it hit a military target but has shown no proof. Trump said he wants to end the war and stop people from dying: “All I want to do is stop the killing.” Image source: File White House claims Trump is healthy and fit to lead Donald Trump is “fully fit” to run the United States, even though he has high cholesterol, slightly high blood pressure, and a scar from a gunshot, according to a report from the White House doctor. The report came after Trump, who is 78 years old, went for his yearly health check-up. The doctor, Sean Barbella, said Trump is in good shape, both physically and mentally, and is taking medicine to manage his cholesterol. Trump’s cholesterol level is now 140, which is healthy. In 2018, it was over 220. His blood pressure is a little high at 128 over 74, but it’s not dangerous. The report also said Trump is up to date on all his vaccines, even though his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has questioned vaccines in the past. Trump still has a scar on his ear from when he was shot at during a campaign rally last year. He survived, but one person died and others were injured. Trump told reporters after the exam: “I think it went well. They did every test you can imagine.” He also said he took a cognitive test to check his memory and thinking skills. He scored 30 out of 30, which means he passed with full marks. The test includes tasks like drawing a clock, remembering words, and naming animals. His heart rate was 62 beats per minute, which is normal for someone in good health. Image source: White House Tariff pause is no relief for South Africa South Africa has been given a 90-day break from Donald Trump’s harsh import tariffs but experts say it’s not really good news. The US dropped tariffs on many SA goods from 31% down to 10%, giving local exporters a bit of breathing room. But analysts and unions say this is just a tactic by Trump’s administration to force South Africa into signing trade deals that favour the US. Trade Minister Parks Tau confirmed that SA is included in the pause and said talks have already begun. But some tariffs, like the 25% tax on cars, steel, and aluminium, are still in place. Experts say the US is using tariffs as a negotiating weapon. Dr Frederich Kirsten, an economist, said: “It’s not about relief — it’s about pressure. The US now holds the cards,” he told The Citizen. Political analyst Sandile Swana warned that the US is trying to change global trade rules. “When you trade with the US, they want your country to play by American rules — even if it hurts your economy,” he said. Unions are worried too. Cosatu says 500,000 jobs in South Africa are linked to trade with the US. They called the 10% tax on agriculture “still too high” and warned that keeping cars at a 25% tariff could kill exports and cause job losses. The US tariff pause isn’t a gift — it’s a way to pressure SA into making deals that could hurt workers, weaken trade rules, and threaten jobs. With unemployment at around 32%, SA can’t afford to play along without a fight. Image source: File Lesotho made Trump’s shirts — now he’s taxing them 50% Some of Donald Trump’s fancy golf shirts were made in Lesotho, the same country he just hit with a huge 50% tariff. Trump’s branded shirts, made by golf legend Greg Norman’s clothing brand, have tags showing they were made in Lesotho. But now, because of Trump’s new import rules, clothing from Lesotho will cost 50% more to bring into the US. That’s bad news for Lesotho. The country depends on selling clothes to the US — it’s one of the biggest parts of its economy and supports 15,000 jobs, News24 reported. Before this, Lesotho’s clothes went into the US tariff-free under a deal called AGOA, which helps African countries trade with America. But that benefit is now gone. The reason? Trump says Lesotho has a trade “imbalance” with the US, mostly because of diamond sales. Greg Norman, who makes the shirts and supports Trump, once called him “a breath of fresh air.” Now, that air comes with a big bill. Lesotho’s economy is closely tied to South Africa. If thousands of jobs are lost there, it can affect trade, migration, and our shared economy. And if Trump is raising tariffs on neighbours like Lesotho, South Africa could face even more pressure — we’ve already been hit with a 30% tariff. Image source: File Trump’s tan taxed as tariff war hits his face Donald Trump’s new import taxes could end up hitting his own face — as prices rise on tanning products used to create his famous orange glow. Trump’s massive new tariffs came into effect on April 5, adding tariffs to thousands of foreign products. And that includes fake tan. Popular UK bronzer brand St. Tropez will now cost Americans 10% more, while Trump’s rumoured favourite face cream — Swiss brand Bronx Colors — will be hit with a 31% tariff. That means the president’s signature orange look could soon come with a higher price tag, Daily Star reported. Trump reportedly insists on 2 bottles of the Swiss concealer in his bedroom at all times. But now, thanks to his own tariffs, Americans will be paying more for beauty products, food, clothes, and electronics. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump wants to ban sex toys and bring back child labour Donald Trump is trying to make it harder to buy sex toys — and easier for kids to work overnight. In Texas, a new law would force people to show their ID just to buy a vibrator online. Sellers who don’t check could face a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. Another proposed law would ban big shops like Walmart from selling sex toys at all — only strip clubs and sex shops would be allowed to sell them. The official term for a sex toy in Texas? An “obscene device” — including dildos and anything used to “stimulate genitals.” Sex expert Dr. Shamyra Howard said, “It turns something normal and healthy into something shameful.” Meanwhile, in Florida, lawmakers want to let 14-year-olds work night shifts, even on school days. One journalist put it simply: “Orgasms are out. Child labour is back.” Image source: File Zimbabwe cuts US tariffs as Africa faces trade war Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, says his country will drop all tariffs on goods coming from the US — just days after Donald Trump slapped an 18% tariff on Zimbabwe’s exports going into America. Mnangagwa says he wants to improve relations with the US and hopes this move will open the door to better trade. But many people say it’s a bad deal. Top journalist Hopewell Chin’ono says Zimbabwe is trying to “please” Trump in the hopes that US sanctions on Mnangagwa will be removed — but he calls it “a long shot.” Zimbabwe has been under some form of US sanctions for over 20 years, mainly due to human rights abuses and corruption. Biden removed the old sanctions last year but kept targeted sanctions on 11 people, including Mnangagwa himself. Now, Zimbabwe says it wants fair trade and friendly relations. But critics say the US will benefit far more from this decision than Zimbabwe will. Trade between the two countries is small — just over $110 million in 2024 — and most experts say scrapping tariffs won’t help Zimbabwe much. Mnangagwa, who is currently the chair of the SADC region, is also being criticised for acting alone. Some say he should be working with other African countries to respond to Trump as a group, not going solo. Trump has placed huge tariffs across Africa: Lesotho says it will send a team to the US to negotiate. Trump’s new tariffs are already hitting South Africa hard, with a 30% tax on goods going into the US. That could hurt our exports, lead to job losses, and make our economy even more unstable. And if other African countries start making one-sided deals, SA could be left behind. Image source: @edmnangagwa Donald Trump calls America a ‘healing patient’ Donald Trump says America is like a patient that just had surgery — and now it’s getting better, thanks to his new trade rules. On what he’s calling “Liberation Day”, Trump signed off on a big new tax (called a tariff) on goods coming into the US from other countries, including the UK, Japan, South Korea and South Africa. For example, goods from South Africa will now face a 30% tariff when they enter America. Even though many Americans are worried about prices going up, Trump celebrated on social media, writing: “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PATIENT WILL BE STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER.” But not everyone is impressed. The UK government says it won’t react just yet, and Japan is deciding whether to fight back with its own tariffs. Experts also pointed out that some of Trump’s claims in his speech were wrong — like when he said American companies aren’t allowed to sell cars in other countries. To make things more awkward, Trump walked off the stage after his speech before signing the actual papers. A staff member had to bring him back to finish the job. When big countries like the US start taxing imports, it can cause global prices to rise. That means we might end up paying more here in South Africa for fuel, food, cars and other goods. Image source: File Elon Musk expected to leave Trump’s government soon Elon Musk is expected to leave his role in Donald Trump’s government in the next few weeks, according to insiders. Musk has been working as a special advisor in Trump’s new department called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But now, with Tesla sales dropping and more people criticising his influence in politics, Musk is stepping back to focus on his businesses. His time as a “special government employee” is set to end around May or June. At a press briefing, Trump said: “At some point, he’s going back. I’d keep him as long as I can — he’s very smart.” But behind the scenes, there’s been trouble. Some people in Trump’s team say Musk’s behaviour has become difficult to manage. His surprise announcements and posts on social media have caused problems, and many in the White House have been frustrated. Musk has also become a political problem. He recently spent millions supporting a judge in an American election — but the judge lost badly. His link to Trump is also hurting Tesla, as some customers are now avoiding the brand. Tesla’s share price has dropped, and some experts say Musk is turning people away with his behaviour. Trump has also started to distance himself from DOGE, the government project Musk created to “cut waste.” Some say it caused more confusion than results. Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, and he’s one of the most powerful people in the world. His role in the US government affects decisions about technology, business, and even space. If Musk steps away from politics, it could change how the US works with other countries — including South Africa. Image source: @POTUS Trump to announce new taxes on imports Donald Trump is set to make a big announcement on Wednesday that could affect prices around the world — including in South Africa. He’s calling it “Liberation Day”, and he plans to add new taxes (called tariffs) on goods coming into the United States from other countries. That means anything the US buys from overseas — like cars, clothes, electronics, oil, and food — could be taxed more. Trump says he’s doing this to protect American businesses and workers, and to punish countries he thinks have taken advantage of the US for years. Reports say Trump may add: These new tariffs would start right away — and many people are worried. Business leaders in the US say the extra taxes will make things more expensive for them, and they’ll likely raise prices for customers to make up for it. That could lead to a rise in the cost of living in many countries. The global stock market has already dropped, and experts say Trump’s plan could help cause a worldwide recession — which means job losses, rising prices, and slower trade. If prices go up in the US and Europe, South Africans could feel it too. We might pay more for things we import, like petrol, electronics and food. If global trade slows down, South African businesses could lose money — and that puts jobs at risk. Image source: File Trump says he’s not joking about a third term as president Donald Trump has suggested he could try to stay in the White House for a third term, despite the US Constitution saying that’s not allowed. Speaking in an interview, the 78-year-old president said “a lot of people want me to do it,” and hinted that his vice president JD Vance could take over as president — and then step down so Trump could return. “I’m not joking,” Trump said. “There are ways you could do it.” Under US law, no president can be elected more than twice. But Trump’s latest comments have experts worried. Former congressman David Jolly warned: “If he says he’s not ruling it out, we should take it seriously.” Legal experts say it’s likely just political theatre — but with Trump, anything is possible. If Trump starts a trade war, it could make everyday things more expensive here in South Africa. Our economy is connected to the global market, so if prices go up in the US and Europe, we feel it too. And if Trump finds a way to stay in power longer than the law allows, it could encourage other world leaders to try the same — which is bad news for democracy everywhere. Image source: @POTUS ‘Pissed off’ Trump warns Putin to back off or face tariffs Donald Trump says he’s “very angry” and “pissed off” with Russian president Vladimir Putin and now he’s threatening major new oil tariffs to force a peace deal in Ukraine. The outburst came after Putin suggested Ukraine should kick out president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of a ceasefire agreement — something Trump called a “step in the wrong direction.” Speaking to NBC News, Trump said: “If Russia and I can’t make a deal to stop the bloodshed, and I think it’s Russia’s fault — which it might be — I’ll hit them with massive tariffs. No more Russian oil in the US. No business with countries that buy it. A 25 to 50% tariff.” Trump has shifted from his previously soft tone on Putin to something more aggressive, even though he insists they still have a “good relationship.” His latest comments come as peace talks drag on with no clear end in sight. Russia says negotiations could stretch into 2026 and continues to demand the lifting of sanctions as a condition for any ceasefire. Meanwhile, Russia continues to bomb Ukrainian cities. A drone strike on Kharkiv this weekend killed two people and injured 35, including patients in a military hospital. A wider or longer war in Ukraine keeps global fuel prices high, food costs rising, and world markets unstable. If Trump gets tough on Russia, it could shake up oil supplies — and the impact will reach South African wallets fast. Image source: File Trump calls himself the fertilisation president Donald Trump has given himself a strange new nickname: “the fertilisation president.” He was speaking at the White House during a Women’s History Month event when he started talking about helping more women access IVF (in vitro fertilisation) — a medical process that helps people have babies. “There will be tremendous goodies in the bag for women,” Trump said. Then he added: “I’ll be known as the fertilisation president — and that’s OK.” People in the room laughed, and Trump smiled: “Actually, I like it. I’ve been called worse.” Trump has been trying to win over more women voters by promising that the government will help pay for fertility treatments. He also made headlines earlier this year when he called himself “the father of IVF,” even though he admitted he didn’t know much about it until recently. Image source: File Trump picks far-right media boss as new US ambassador to SA US President Donald Trump has nominated Brent Bozell — a hardcore conservative media figure — as America’s new ambassador to South Africa. Bozell is best known for founding the Media Research Center, a group that attacks what it calls “liberal bias” in the US media. Trump made the announcement on his social media account, calling Bozell “fearless” and praising his “extraordinary experience.” “Brent brings fearless tenacity, extraordinary experience, and vast knowledge to a Nation that desperately needs it,” Trump wrote. “Congratulations Brent!” Bozell could replace Reuben Brigety, who resigned in January after several rocky months in Pretoria. His nomination was confirmed this week in a formal note sent to the US Senate. This comes as relations between the US and South Africa remain tense, with Trump cutting funding and booting SA’s ambassador Ebrahim Rasool out of Washington earlier this month. Bozell is a known Trump loyalist who’s been part of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. Some insiders say this appointment is less about diplomacy — and more about messaging. Brent Bozell is not a diplomat — he’s a political activist who supports Trump’s views and often attacks anyone who disagrees. His appointment means the US may take a tougher, more aggressive approach toward South Africa. That could make it harder for our government to work with the US on things like trade, diplomacy, and international issues like Ukraine or Gaza. Image source: @SenMikeLee Heavyweight clash at White House ends with missing belt Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed this week that he doesn’t know what happened to the WBC championship belt he brought to the White House months ago as a gift for Donald Trump. The belt, given to him by heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk after beating Tyson Fury, was meant as a peace offering. But instead of handing it over, Zelenskyy pulled out a folder of disturbing war photos showing tortured Ukrainian soldiers — and the meeting turned into a political punch-up. Trump, who had already called Zelenskyy a dictator, exploded on camera. “You’re gambling with World War III,” he snapped. Zelenskyy now says he left the belt on a side table and never saw it again. “Maybe it’s still sitting there,” he told Time magazine this week. Reports say a staffer moved it to Trump’s private dining room — where it may now be collecting dust next to tomato sauce bottles and golf trophies. Zelenskyy says he doesn’t regret showing the photos instead of the belt. “He has kids. He should feel what we feel,” he said. “But yeah… the conversation went in a different direction.” Image source: File Trump’s team accidentally texts war plans to journalist Top Trump officials have accidentally leaked secret US war plans in a messaging app group chat — by including a journalist in the conversation. The group, made up of senior figures like Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was discussing attacks on Yemen when they mistakenly added Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg says he was shocked to see real-time details of the military operation, including names of officials and sensitive tactics. “I thought it was a prank,” he said. “But the attack happened exactly as they planned it.” The Trump administration has confirmed the breach but is trying to downplay the damage. Hegseth even told reporters, “Nobody was texting war plans.” Goldberg hit back: “That’s a lie. He was.” If Trump’s top officials can’t keep their own war plans private, it puts global security at risk. Countries like South Africa often work with the US on trade, security, and international cooperation. But if the US keeps making mistakes like this, it’s harder to trust them. Image source: @POTUS Rasool says ‘don’t replace me with a white ambassador’ Former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool has told President Cyril Ramaphosa not to choose a white replacement just to please Donald Trump. Speaking at a homecoming rally in Cape Town on Sunday, Rasool told ANC supporters that South Africa must fix its relationship with the US but without sacrificing its values. “We can’t think that just because America has a white president, we need a white ambassador,” he said. “We need someone who can rebuild ties, but still stand strong for what we believe in.” Rasool was kicked out of the US last week after Trump’s government accused him of being disrespectful. Now, names like deputy minister Andries Nel and former DA leader Tony Leon are being floated as possible replacements but the presidency says there’s no rush. Rasool also called for a new kind of diplomacy — one based on Ubuntu. “Ubuntu diplomacy is not about lying to protect your country or flattering your host,” he said. “It’s about telling the truth with respect, standing your ground, and keeping your dignity.” The next ambassador will shape how South Africa navigates a tough relationship with Trump’s US. That choice will say a lot about whether we stand firm — or bend under pressure. Image source: File France wants the Statue of Liberty back French leaders are demanding that the United States give back the Statue of Liberty — all because of Donald Trump. French politician Raphaël Glucksmann says the statue, which was gifted to the US 140 years ago, no longer belongs there. He says Trump has “sided with tyrants” and no longer represents the values the statue stands for. “We gave it to you as a symbol of freedom,” Glucksmann said. “But if you’ve chosen to support dictators and silence scientists, then we want our gift back.” The Trump administration hit back hard, saying the statue is going nowhere. A White House spokesperson said France should be grateful to the US for helping them win World War II and added that “if it wasn’t for America, they’d be speaking German.” Even Australia’s former Prime Minister jumped in, reminding everyone that France once helped America fight the British in its own war for independence. This may sound like political theatre but it shows how Trump’s actions are damaging US relationships around the world. As America isolates itself, smaller countries like South Africa feel the knock-on effects in trade, global funding, and foreign policy influence. Image source: File Trump says Rasool must leave the US by Friday South Africa’s ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, has just days to clear out his office and leave America after being declared “persona non grata” by the Trump administration. The diplomatic bombshell dropped when Secretary of State Marco Rubio blasted Rasool as a “race-baiting politician who hates President Trump” in a social media post after the ambassador discussed white Americans becoming a minority. Rasool’s diplomatic privileges expired Monday, and he must be out of the country by Friday. President Ramaphosa is trying to downplay the crisis, calling it a “hiccup” and promising to engage “with deep respect” for Trump, but this comes right after Trump cut funding to South Africa over alleged “anti-white policies.” As our top diplomat gets ready to fly home, South Africans should watch closely – when ambassadors get expelled, serious economic and political fallout usually follows. Image source: SA Embassy Is Trump just Musk’s babysitter now? New photos from the White House have people asking: who’s really in charge — Donald Trump or Elon Musk? The pictures show Trump walking next to Musk’s four-year-old son while Musk walks ahead, talking to his staff. In one photo, Trump is even seen helping the boy — nicknamed “Lil X” — onto the presidential helicopter. Social media had a field day. “Trump finally got a real job — he’s Lil X’s nanny now,” one person joked. Another said: “Imagine being the president but spending your day babysitting a billionaire’s child.” Some people even asked, “Does this kid live at the White House now?” One user replied: “Of course he does — he’s the real president!” Musk posted one of the photos himself, calling it “a happy picture.” But many people noticed something else: Musk walking ahead like the boss, while Trump trails behind with the child. “It really shows who has the power,” one person wrote. Since Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), Musk has become one of the most powerful people in Washington. Musk was born in Pretoria and now he’s influencing major decisions in the US. That could affect South Africa too, from how we use social media and tech to deals around space, green energy and trade. If Musk is the one calling the shots, his choices could impact jobs, prices, and policies here at home. Image source: @POTUS Putin “agrees” to Trump’s ceasefire plan but with a catch Putin just said yes to Trump’s 30-day ceasefire plan for Ukraine, but don’t get too excited. While thanking Trump for “regulating the conflict,” Putin added he has “a lot of questions” and any deal must “lead to long-term peace” – Putin-speak for getting what he wants. The Russian leader couldn’t help boasting that his forces “are on the offensive everywhere” and warned Ukrainian troops they must “surrender or die.” Experts think Putin’s agreement comes with hidden conditions and might just be playing nice with Trump, who has now restored military aid to Ukraine after Zelenskyy agreed to ceasefire talks. Why should South Africans care? Because global conflicts affect our economy directly – from higher food prices to unstable markets. Plus, watching Trump broker deals between Russia and Ukraine shows how he handles international problems – a preview of what other countries (including ours) might face. Image source: File Trump’s right hand tells a story the White House won’t explain Something strange is going on with Trump’s hand. A dark mark keeps showing up in photos – most recently during his meeting with Ireland’s leader. The White House claims it’s just from Trump shaking too many hands. But medical experts aren’t buying it. Dr. Anatalia Moore, a skin specialist, says normal handshakes don’t cause bruises like that, Daily Star reported. She thinks it might be from a medical procedure where doctors put a drip in his hand. She also points out that at 78, Trump could bruise more easily from just bumping into things, as older people often have balance issues and their bodies heal slower. While it might just be makeup or a minor bruise, these marks are raising questions about the president’s health – something worth watching as his physical condition could affect his decisions on South Africa and other global issues. Image source: @POTUS Trump opens door for Afrikaner resettlement in America It’s official – the US is now actively working to bring Afrikaner South Africans to America as refugees. The US Embassy just confirmed they’re reviewing applications and will contact people who’ve already applied. This isn’t just Trump talking anymore – it’s becoming real policy. Trump claims South Africa is “confiscating” white farmers’ land “without compensation” after Ramaphosa signed the Expropriation Act. Most experts say this isn’t true, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from offering “a rapid pathway to citizenship” for these farmers. About 1,500 Afrikaners have already gathered outside the US Embassy in Pretoria to thank Trump for his support. Meanwhile, our government refuses to get into a shouting match with Trump, with Ramaphosa’s spokesperson saying South Africa won’t engage in “counterproductive megaphone diplomacy.” The big question now: How many farmers will actually pack up and leave? And what would that mean for our farms, food security, and race relations? Image source: File Trump’s market panic and what it means for South Africa By Dylan Bettencourt The US stock market just took a nasty dive after Trump twice dodged questions about a recession. Why should you care? Because when America sneezes, South Africa catches a cold. Trump’s chaos affects us directly: – When global markets panic, the Rand usually weakens – Weaker Rand = more expensive imports = higher prices at the shops – Foreign investors get nervous about putting money in countries like ours – Our exports become less valuable if America’s economy slows down Trump admitted his policies might cause economic “pain” before things get better. His own team is now rushing to calm markets, promising there won’t be a recession. For South Africans already struggling with high prices, Trump’s unpredictable style is the last thing we need. The big question: Will Trump back down like he did with Canada and Mexico, or stick to his disruptive plans? Either way, as one expert warned: “Good luck in this challenging time.” Image source: File De Klerk foundation rejects Trump’s farmer ‘rescue’ plan By Dylan Bettencourt The FW de Klerk Foundation has rejected Trump’s offer to give US citizenship to white South African farmers. Their message? Trump’s plan is based on “disinformation and cheap politics” with “no basis in truth.” Christo van der Rheede put it simply: “The challenges we face in South Africa aren’t just white people’s problems. We’re all affected by crime, unemployment and bad policies.” The Foundation warns that Trump’s actions will hurt South Africa’s economy and farming industry. They also connect Trump’s move to the rise of “ethnic nationalism” worldwide, suggesting right-wing groups are using this to attack South Africa’s non-racial democracy established in 1994. Meanwhile, our government won’t engage in “megaphone diplomacy” – choosing to ignore Trump’s social media outbursts rather than dignify them with a response. Image source: File Health Minister says Trump ‘doesn’t’ owe us a cent’ By Dylan Bettencourt Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said “Trump doesn’t owe South Africa any cent whatsoever” after the US president cut R8 billion in HIV/AIDS funding. Instead of complaining, he called on South Africa to “stand on our own” and revealed he’s already talking to other donors like the Gates Foundation to replace Trump’s money. EFF’s Malema had a different take, claiming the cuts are “Israel’s revenge” for South Africa’s support of Palestine. He also warned that land reform will continue “whether they like it or not.” Motsoaledi couldn’t resist taking a jab at right-wing group Solidarity’s recent White House visit, distinguishing them from the COVID Solidarity Fund that’s helping fill funding gaps. The bottom line for South Africans living with HIV? The political blame game won’t matter if someone doesn’t step up to save the program that employs 15,000 healthcare workers and keeps millions of patients alive. Image source: @MYANC Trump says ‘nobody has ever heard of’ Lesotho Trump just took a cheap shot at our neighbor Lesotho in his Congress speech, calling it a country “nobody has ever heard of” while Republican lawmakers laughed along. Why? He was defending his foreign aid cuts, specifically “$8 million for LGBTQI+” in Lesotho – though local LGBTQ groups say they never got this money. Lesotho’s Foreign Minister is angry, calling the comments “shocking” and promising to send a formal protest to Washington. The real impact? Lesotho has the world’s second-highest HIV rate, and Trump’s funding cuts threaten healthcare programs that people on both sides of the border rely on. For South Africans, it’s perhaps a reminder of how Trump sees African nations – as jokes, not partners. Image source: @POTUS Zelenskyy folds after Trump cuts military aid By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just announced he’s got a letter from Zelenskyy saying Ukraine is “ready to come to the negotiating table” – quite the U-turn after last week’s White House showdown. After getting his military aid cut off, Zelenskyy’s now saying he wants to “make things right” and is ready “any time and in any convenient format” to sign that minerals deal he previously walked away from. Trump’s also claiming he’s had “serious discussions with Russia” and received “strong signals they’re ready for peace.” For South Africans, this drama is worth watching closely. What happens when a superpower suddenly changes sides? We’re seeing countries that depend on American support scrambling to adjust. In Trump’s world, yesterday’s allies can become today’s bargaining chips – a lesson that applies just as much to Pretoria as it does to Kyiv. Image source: File Trump leaves Ukraine stranded By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just pulled the plug on Ukraine’s military aid after publicly arguing with Zelenskyy. No more weapons, no more ammo – not even stuff that’s already on ships heading there. It’s the same tactic he used when cutting South Africa’s HIV funding. One day you’ve got support, the next you don’t. When Zelenskyy dared say peace might be “very, very far away,” Trump didn’t hold back: the Ukrainian president “won’t be around very long” unless he plays ball. The message for countries like ours is crystal clear: in Trump’s world, you either give him what he wants or he’ll pull the rug out from under you – no warning, no negotiations. So when South African ministers next fly to Washington, they’d better have more than just goodwill in their briefcases. In Trumpland, it’s deal or no deal. Image source: File Trump vs Zelensky fight in White House Smackdown By Dylan Bettencourt Trump and Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy argued live on TV and SA analyst Sandile Swana says it’s a whole new ballgame. Gone are the days of friendly military aid. Trump’s message was crystal clear: “No minerals, no protection.” While Zelensky talked about friendship, Trump talked about business – leaving the Ukrainian leader visibly stunned. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Association of South Africa is urging us not to abandon Ukraine, warning that Putin won’t stop his expansion plans anytime soon. Trump’s “my way or the highway” approach could be coming to an international relationship near you. US ambassador quits as SA relations hit rock bottom By Dylan Bettencourt In the latest Trump-era shake-up, Dana Brown, America’s acting ambassador to South Africa, has suddenly resigned. This exit happens just as relations hit rock bottom, with Trump cutting all funding to South Africa and offering refugee status to Afrikaner farmers. The timing couldn’t be worse for South Africans. With no permanent US ambassador since January and Brown now leaving in March, our diplomatic channel to America is running on skeleton staff just when we need it most. Meanwhile, Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity flew to the White House seeking “humanitarian assistance” – a move Ramaphosa slammed as “sowing divisions.” For ordinary South Africans, this diplomatic cold war threatens everything from healthcare funding to trade relations, showing how Trump’s personal politics directly impacts our national interests. Image source: US Embassy Trump axes USAID funding for HIV By Dylan Bettencourt Trump on Thursday pulled the plug on R8.1 billion in HIV funding, telling South African organisations to “immediately cease all activities.” He sent just letters saying the programs “aren’t aligned with Agency priorities.” This isn’t just American politics – it’s about your friend, neighbour or family member who depends on these services. Some 8 million South Africans rely on HIV treatment programs, and these cuts threaten real lives in our communities. While the government scrambles for a response, healthcare workers are losing jobs and vulnerable patients are left hanging. From sex workers to pregnant moms, the impact hits hardest on those who need help most.As one health worker put it to Bhekisasa: “This isn’t just a funding cut – it’s a betrayal.” Image source: File Gauteng minister copies Elon Musk strategy By Zukile Majova The Gauteng health department is checking if all 85,642 people on its payroll are real workers who actually show up for work. The department has already frozen the salaries of 66 workers who haven’t come forward to prove they exist. Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko says her department can’t waste money paying ghost workers when hospitals need more staff and patients need care. “We have limited resources at our disposal and cannot afford to waste money on ghost workers while hundreds of healthcare workers are looking for employment and thousands of people require access to healthcare services,” she said. The department’s new Ziveze (Reveal Yourself) Campaign follows a similar move by Elon Musk in America. Musk emailed US government workers asking them to prove what work they’ve done. The billionaire head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency said: “All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” In Gauteng, workers must go to their HR office to prove they are real employees. Those who don’t show up risk losing their jobs and could face criminal charges. So far, 23,789 workers still need to prove they exist. Image source: @NkomoNomantu Ukraine fights back against Trump’s mineral grab By Rorisang Modiba Trump’s got Zelenskyy flying to Washington on Friday to sign a deal over Ukraine’s precious minerals. Trump initially wanted a massive $500bn chunk of Ukraine’s resources – imagine someone trying that with our platinum! Much like how South Africans get nervous when foreign companies eye our mineral wealth, Ukrainians weren’t having it. Zelenskyy flat-out refused to sign something “10 generations would have to repay.” Now, they’ve settled on sharing ownership instead – sound familiar? It’s the same dance our government does with mining giants over our resources. As global powers scramble for these battery metals and rare earths, South Africa should watch closely. This is exactly the kind of pressure our mineral-rich country could face next. Image source: File © Copyright Scrolla.Africa

July 31, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: AIR FRANCE - KLM AIR FRANCE - KLM xx July 31, 2025 FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Commenting on the results, Mr. Benjamin Smith, Group CEO, said: “Air France-KLM delivered a solid second quarter, with revenue growth and improved margins, reflecting the strength of our diversified network and the disciplined execution of our strategy. We are advancing premiumization, pushing the boundaries of aspirational travel with enhanced products and services, while progressing on the renewal of our fleet with next-generation aircraft, in line with our sustainability efforts. At the same time, we are reinforcing global connectivity through key partnerships and joint ventures in strategic areas, and, in early July, we initiated proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. This marks a major step to strengthen our position in Northern Europe and expand our network reach. Although the external environment remains complex, Air France-KLM continues to demonstrate its resilience and is well positioned to achieve its targets. I want to thank all our teams for their continued commitment — their dedication is what makes this performance possible.” Solid Group unit revenue performance *IFRS Operating free cash flow corrected from the repayment of deferred social charges, pensions contributions and wage taxes granted during the Covid period and payment of lease debt and interests paid and received Operating result improvement driven by unit revenue development and fuel price evolution In the second quarter of 2025, Air France-KLM welcomed 27.3 million passengers which is 5.9% above last year. As capacity and traffic increased by 4.2%, the load factor remained stable at 87.8%. The Group unit revenue per ASK was up 2.4% year-on-year at constant currency, driven by strong yield performance in Network (passenger and cargo) and Transavia. Passenger yields were strong on the North Atlantic, despite the tariff turbulence, while also increasing in Asia & Middle East, Latin America and led by the premium cabins. Cargo continued to benefit from traffic out of Asia with unit revenues per ATK up 2.6% at constant currency. The operating result rose €223 million year-on-year to €736 million, with a margin of 8.7%. This performance was driven by a €176 million increase in unit revenues across the passenger network, Cargo and Transavia while unit costs including fuel remained broadly stable. Q2 unit cost1 was up 2.7% as a consequence of the below elements: Cash In the second quarter Air France/Air France-KLM and KLM extended both their Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) until 2029. The total amount of the Group RCFs is maintained at €2.4 billion, and these facilities are currently undrawn. Through this transaction, Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM are extending the average maturity of available resources, in line with the Group's policy of careful liquidity management. For the first half of the year, the Group reported a positive operating free cash flow of €1,285 million, supported mainly by a favorable working capital from ticket sales, although impacted by the deferrals inherited from the pandemic which amounted to €244 million. Net capex amounted to €1.742 million. Recurring adjusted operating free cash flow2 reached €723 million, an increase of €589 million year-on-year. The operating free cash flow stood at €1.3 billion, partly offset by almost €1.2 billion in new and modified lease debt driven by fleet renewal and extension of current leases to cover delivery delays. As a consequence net debt decreased to €7.1 billion, down €197 million. The leverage ratio stood at 1.5x in line with the Group’s ambition of 1.5x to 2.0x. The level of cash at hand remains high and above the targeted level of €6 billion to €8 billion. At the end of June, the cash at hand stood at €9.4 billion, stable versus the end of 2024. During the first half year of 2025, the following transactions took place: The net proceeds of the issue of the Hybrid Bonds is used by the Company for refinancing of existing subordinated instruments within the Group. This issue enables the Group to simplify its balance sheet and optimize its cost of financing while maintaining financial flexibility. The Group’s strategy is to reduce the stock of subordinated instruments on its balance sheet. In July (after the Q2 closing) Air France-KLM fully redeemed the perpetual bonds issued in July 2022 for an amount of €500 million. These bonds were issued by an operating affiliate of Air France, that owns a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline’s Engineering and Maintenance activities and was fully subscribed by Apollo affiliated entities. The transaction three years ago supported Air France-KLM in its trajectory to come back to a positive equity position under IFRS and the Group thanks Apollo for the smooth partnership during this trajectory. Rating update FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Sustainability Sustainability is a collective responsibility, and Air France- KLM is committed to play its role. The Group supports the adoption of ambitious environmental targets, advocating for an industry- wide transformation that ensures a global level playing field. Fleet Renewal In line with its fleet renewal strategy, Air France-KLM continues to take delivery of new generation aircraft such as Airbus A350s, B787-10, A320neo family aircraft, A220s, Embraer 195-E2s. These new generation aircraft consume up to 25% less fuel per passenger km and reduce the noise footprint by up to 63% compared to the previous generation aircraft they replace. At the end of June 2025, the Group had 30% of its fleet composed of new generation aircraft. The Group aims to get up to 80% of its fleet with new generation aircraft by 2030. SAF The Air France-KLM Group is working on increasing SAF demand and usage, driving its growth and development worldwide. On April 23, 2025, the Carb Aéro call for projects award ceremony was held at Air France’s headquarters at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. This initiative, part of the France 2030 investment program, aims to support the emergence of an e-SAF (synthetic drop-in fuel substitute to conventional fossil-based jet fuel) sector — a key technology in achieving the decarbonization goals of the aviation industry. As an airline group fully committed to decarbonizing its industry, Air France-KLM proudly hosted this event and reaffirmed its support for the development of an industrial ecosystem for sustainable fuel production in France — contributing to the country’s energy sovereignty and competitiveness. In June 2025, on the occasion of the Paris Air Show, Air France signed the SAF component of the New Energy Systems sector contract with the French government and industry partners. In the presence of Mr. Eric Lombard (Minister of Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty), Mr. Marc Ferracci (Minister for Industry and Energy), Mr. Philippe Tabarot (Minister for Transport) and Nathalie Delattre (Minister for Tourism), four main objectives were identified: In parallel, the Air France-KLM Group also signed an agreement with Airbus, enabling the aircraft manufacturer’s employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting SAF production. This voluntary commitment is part of the Air France-KLM “Corporate SAF” program and aims to develop a transparent, traceable, and verifiable SAF offering. GHG emissions per RTK (revenue ton-kilometer) At the end of June 2025, the indicator was 924 gCO₂eq/RTK6, which represents a 1.5% reduction compared to end of June 2024. Air France-KLM and its airlines are facing some headwinds to their GHG intensity reduction due to unforeseen and external events beyond the Group’s control, including delays in executing the fleet renewal plan due to constraints in the supply chain; engine issues with part of its new generation aircraft fleet (such as several Airbus A220’s) not allowing the Group to operate them to their maximum capacity; higher fuel consumption due to longer flight time on certain routes caused by different geopolitical circumstances. Given above headwinds it is unlikely that the 2025 target of the Sustainability Linked Bond will be reached. Post quarter events Air France-KLM to initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS On the 4th of July 2025, Air France-KLM announced that it will initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. The Group currently holds a 19.9% stake in the Scandinavian carrier and since the summer of 2024, it has implemented a commercial cooperation between SAS, Air France and KLM in the form of extended code-share and interline agreements, further strengthened by SAS joining the SkyTeam alliance. Provided all the necessary conditions are met, Air France-KLM would fully acquire the stakes held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, bringing its own stake to 60.5%. The Danish State would retain its 26.4% stake in SAS and its seats on the Board of Directors. The value of Air France-KLM’s contemplated investment in SAS would be determined at closing, based on SAS’s latest financial performance – including EBITDA and Net Debt. This transaction would be in line with the Group’s medium-term financial outlook. Business review Network result Compared to the second quarter of 2024, total revenues increased by +4.6% to €6,937 million. The operating result reached €666 million up €190 million year-on-year at constant currency driven by higher revenues and fuel price reduction. The operating margin improved to 9.6%, an increase of 2.9 point compared to 2024. Passenger network delivers solid Q2 performance with Premium cabin strength and yield gains During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) was 2.8% higher than last year. Traffic growth of +2.9% has led to a stable load factor at 87.4%. Yield at constant currency showed strong performance, up 2.8%, leading to a unit revenue of 2.8% year-on-year at constant currency. During the second quarter we observed the following trends in: North Atlantic Despite a 5% capacity growth, unit revenue increased by 5% driven by positive front cabin yield development while Economy cabin yield declined year-on-year. June performance was affected by the Middle East conflict. Latin America Unit revenue grew on the back of strong yield (+6.1%), while load factor was slightly up at 91% and capacity increased by 5.6%. Asia & Middle East Growth was mainly supported by Asia while Middle East capacity was impacted by geopolitical tensions. Strong performance on Japan, Korea & South-East Asia. Unit revenue in the region was up 6%, supported by strong yield development while load factor remained stable at 89%. Caribbean & Indian Ocean A strong industry wide capacity increase (Air France-KLM: +5%) led to a more competitive fare environment and 2% decline in unit revenue. AfricaCapacity, load factor and yield remained broadly stable year-on-year. Short and Medium-haul Overall, capacity rose 5%, with a broadly stable load factor at 85% and yield remaining flat. The focus was on stimulating local traffic and volumes to support additional capacity. In the first half of the year, revenue from the premium segment grew by 11% year-on-year, increasing its contribution to passenger network revenue to 28.7%, up from 27.3% in the same period last year. This positive trend was observed across all regions. The introduction of the new La Première cabin, which further strengthened the premium offering, generated great exposure. On the Transatlantic network, the premium revenue share remained broadly stable, above 41%. Premium and Premium Comfort continued its strong momentum with a 27% year-on-year increase, bringing its share in the passenger network revenue to 8.1%, compared to 6.7% in the first half year of 2024. Cargo: robust performance During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Ton Kilometers (ATK) rose 1.4% year-on-year. Full freighter capacity was negatively impacted by longer-than-expected maintenance. Traffic grew 1.1% slightly below capacity growth keeping the load factor broadly stable at 45.5%. Together with a 3% increase in yield, unit revenue per ATK increased by 2.6% at constant currency. In June, KLM completed the cutover from the old IT systems to the new system which was already done last year by Air France. During the WACA (World Air Cargo Awards) 2025, Air France-KLM Cargo was declared Best European Airline. The award won by Air France-KLM Cargo is a recognition for airlines that have demonstrated outstanding performance and consistently provide excellent service, show leadership, and contribute to the development of the air cargo sector, globally or in their region. Transavia: Revenue growth and yield improvement support Q2 results amid cost pressures Transavia’s capacity in available seat kilometers grew 11.4%, while traffic increased by 11.2%, resulting in a broadly stable load factor. Unit revenue was up +2.9%, supported by positive yield development at both Transavia France and the Netherlands. However, Transavia Netherlands faced increased competition, partly due to redirected capacity from Middle East towards other European destinations, putting the unit revenues under pressure. Also the increase in Schiphol tariffs in combination with the increase of the ticket tax last year which is resulting in higher ticket prices was pushing travelers to airports in Germany. In France performance was affected by a strike that led to significant customer compensations. Overall, unit cost increased by 4.9% despite lower fuel prices, mainly due to an increase in wet leases activity for Transavia the Netherlands. Maintenance business: double digit growth and improved operating margin sssss The maintenance segment continued its strong growth in Q2 2025 with third-party revenues up 19.3%, driven by a strong recovery on the engine activities. The total revenues rose 14.6%. The operating result increased by €33 million and the operating margin improved to 5.1%, up 2.0 point from 2024. On June 17th, AFI KLM E&M, the MRO branch of Air France-KLM, and AerCap have announced that they have entered into exclusive negotiations to form a LEAP engine leasing joint venture. The parties intend to jointly own and manage a fleet of CFMI LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines enabling uninterrupted Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX fleet operations, while engines are going for a quick-turn or performance restoration shop visit within the AFI KLM E&M MRO network. The formation of this joint venture, which is subject to any necessary approval, will strengthen Air France KLM positioning on the MRO market by leveraging combined and complementary expertise in engine leasing, asset management and MRO services providing comprehensive MRO support to its customers all over the world. Through the second quarter 2025, AFI KLM E&M also finalized and announced numerous major long-term MRO contracts including: With these new contracts, Air France KLM MRO activity reinforces even further its market positioning and grows its order book on key strategic segments. Air France’s Q2 operating result improved significantly on unit revenue growth Air France Group In the second quarter, the operating result reached €490 million, up €295 million year-on-year. This performance was mainly driven by strong unit revenue growth (+3.4% year-on-year), reflecting the absence of last year’s €40m Olympic Games impact, sustained premium demand and high yield alongside lower fuel prices. Air France Group achieved an operating margin of 9.5%, up 5.4 points from 2024, despite the increase in the solidarity tax on flight tickets (TSBA), effective March 1, 2025, which is expected to impact the 2025 operating result by €90-170 million. KLM: Operating margin under pressure due to cost headwinds KLM Group Second quarter revenues grew 4.0%, in line with capacity growth. Yields improved for passenger network, Cargo and Transavia, while load factors decreased for all three businesses. The change in operating result reflects the impact of the NATO summit in June and last years’ positive maintenance-related one-off. Further improvement was constrained by higher Schiphol tariffs, the grounding of seven 787 aircraft in May, and last year’s CLA increase, mitigated by the delivery of Back on Track initiatives. The Back on Track program delivered €185 million in the first half of the year, as planned, with main contributions coming from various cost and revenue-improving initiatives and Maintenance. The latter supported performance by increasing third-party revenues and reducing non-performance cost at KLM. Productivity gains began in the second quarter from ground staff and cabin crew, though further acceleration depends partly on the outcome of ongoing CLA discussions. Meanwhile, Schiphol tariffs increased as of April and maintenance costs remain elevated. Despite headwinds like the delayed implementation of the CLA, the Back on track target of €450 million remains unchanged. Flying Blue delivers solid growth and robust margin in Q2 Flying Blue Miles In the second quarter Flying Blue Miles generated €226 million total revenue, including revenues from third party airline and non-airline partners. The operating margin reached 26.5%. Overall Flying Blue delivered a strong performance in the second quarter thanks to: Nb: Sum of individual airline and Flying Blue results does not add up to AF-KLM total due to intercompany eliminations at Group level. ****** The external auditors carried out limited review procedures.

Title: Luxury boom helps fuel boutique brokerages in South Florida

search Nearly 11K firms with five agents or fewer exist in the tri-county region SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE The top broker in Palm Beach County isn’t with Douglas Elliman, Corcoran Group or Compass. It’s David Roberts, owner of Royal Palm Properties, a one-broker firm that focuses on the gated community for which it is named: Royal Palm Yacht & Country Club. Roberts closed more than $636 million in on-market sales in 2024, making him the highest-ranked broker in the county, according to The Real Deal’s analysis. He’s in the company of other top independent brokers like Christian Angle and Lawrence Moens. The three of them are among the thousands of boutique brokerage owners in South Florida. While smaller firms are lesser known than national brands like Elliman, Corcoran or Compass, industry experts say this model can be just as successful with effective leadership and a market niche. They don’t have access to public market capital, but that also means they aren’t allowed the excesses that can plague the bottomlines of larger firms. Owners run a tight ship, or it sinks. “There’s some great stories of men and women who have built some very large fortunes out of this brokerage industry,” said Steve Murray, president of RealTrends Consulting and an oracle of the business, referring to small firms. There are nearly 13,000 brokerages with 100 agents or fewer in the tri-county region, according to TRD’s research, making it the predominant brokerage model in South Florida. Of those, almost 11,000 firms in the tri-county region have five agents or fewer. Twelve brokerages have more than 1,000 agents, and 136 are in the 101-agent to 1,000-agent range. Not every uber-boutique team is doing major business, but some of them control the submarkets they operate in. These are big-time agents, the kind national firms try to woo. Remaining independent comes with its risks. These agents must navigate the challenges of running a business in addition to closing deals. For some, sharing commissions is worth avoiding the headache of running your own shop. “A lot of people like having the backstop of a big brand, they see an identity in that,” said Erin Sykes, a broker and owner of boutique, Side-backed firm Sykes Properties. “Not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur.” It’s never been easy to be in the brokerage business. Firms strive toward profitability while balancing ever-thinning margins. Murray estimates only two-thirds of brokerages in the U.S. are profitable. This has been a particularly turbulent time for the industry. Last year, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) coughed up $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits that resulted in new rules around who pays an agent’s commission. And Compass and Zillow’s battle over NAR’s Clear Cooperation Policy has been ramping up. Meanwhile, major players are still trying to get their balance sheets in the black. Compass marked its first full year as cash-flow positive since it was founded in 2012. In May, Anywhere Real Estate floated a takeover of Douglas Elliman, whose stock price has struggled in recent years. All of this is clouded by the effects of high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Nationally, pending home sales for the spring quarter hit a 13-year low. But it’s a more complicated story in South Florida, where an unprecedented, years-long wealth migration has fueled luxury sales. According to a report from Knight Frank, the Palm Beach and Miami markets closed a combined $2.7 billion in sales of $10 million and up in the first quarter of the year. That’s up 50 percent from $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. “The main boutiques that seem to do really well, they tend to specialize in luxury homes,” Murray said, adding that affluent clients prioritize personal relationships. “What people from outside the industry — Wall Street types — don’t understand, is about 7 out of 10 housing buyers and sellers choose an agent because someone they know referred them,” he said. Top independent agents, especially in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, “have developed a reputation among a select clientele for being the go-to person. It doesn’t matter what brokerage they’re with, or even if they’re with some big brokerage.” Each boutique broker is defined by their specialization, industry experts say. Alex Pirez, the head of Mocca Group and its brokerage arm, Mocca Realty, focuses on selling his spec homes. In April, he sold the over 9,000-square-foot home at 4820 Southwest 86th Terrace in Miami’s Ponce-Davis neighborhood for $14.5 million. Jordan Karp, the son of architect Kobi Karp and head of his own namesake brokerage, focuses on off-market residential and commercial deals. He started his business brokering investment sales for his family, and now plays in Miami Beach’s ultra-luxury sandbox. In March, he brokered the $60 million off-market sale of developer James Curnin’s waterfront La Gorce Island mansion. He said he’s gotten offers from large brokerages, but isn’t interested. “I’m like a Swiss army knife, I kind of don’t fit into a box,” he said. “It’s not about the money for me, it’s more about the independence and the freedom.” But earning potential is certainly a factor in many agents’ decisions to go solo. After eight years with Nest Seekers International, Sykes left to partner with Side, a San Francisco-based venture-backed startup that provides back-end services for independent brokerages. She focuses on Palm Beach, the Hamptons, New York City and the Jersey Shore. “My take home at the end of the day is higher,” said Sykes. “Which is of course a motivator.” Being able to work across luxury markets has prompted other broker moves. Brett Harris, a top agent with Elliman, recently left the brokerage to join Bespoke, citing the ability to sell in the Hamptons and Aspen in addition to South Florida. Marco Tiné, an agent in Miami, was with Coldwell Banker for nine years when he left to start his boutique firm, Casa Collection Realty, with Side in 2022. He was unhappy with the technology the firm offered, and felt he was sharing too much of his commission. When asked if he made more money after launching Casa, Tiné responded, “big time.” But while the back-end technology offered was much better than before, Tiné found the execution of the services Side was supposed to provide was “very poor.” He also saw other agents launch with Side and struggle to run their businesses. Tiné, a longtime fan of Serhant, jumped at the first opportunity to work with him in Miami, moving his team when the Brickell office opened in 2023. His split now is comparable to what he was making with Side, he said, declining to share specifics. Returning to the fold of a larger brand means more visibility for his team, he said. But at the end of the day, it’s still about relationships. “Clients will do business with you because they like you. It doesn’t matter what brand you’re working with,” he said. “You like the person and you trust the person, it’s that simple.” All rights reserved © 2025 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.

July 30, 2025 02:15 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino Q2 SALES AND H1 2025 RESULTS The New Casino: an improving first half-year Growth in net sales: +2.4% LFL in Q2 and +0.5% in H1 Supported by a more favourable market environment in Q2 and the initial results of its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan, the Group is back to growth for the first time since its financial restructuring, with a second-quarter rise across all convenience brands. +12% growth in adjusted EBITDA The initial measures to streamline the store network and to cut costs are paying off, enabling the Group to improve its adjusted EBITDA over the first half of the year: Cash-flow and debt A +€366m improvement in free cash-flow before financial expenses, to -€48m, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments, better control of operating expenses and a basis of comparison adversely affected by the Q1 2024 payment of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash-flow nevertheless reaches -€131m. The Group also paid -€185m in costs related to discontinued HM/SM operations, taking its net debt to €1,407m and its net leverage ratio to 9.75x. The consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon for the six months ended 30 June 2025 were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on 29 July 2025. Review procedures were performed on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements by the Statutory Auditors. Their review report, which contains no reservations or observations, is in the process of being issued. Philippe Palazzi, Chief Executive Officer of Casino Group, said: “The operating and financial results for the second quarter of 2025 are encouraging. Thanks to the success of our new concepts, the roll-out of new quick meal solutions and the further streamlining of our store network, the Group’s transformation continues. The performance over the last few months shows the relevance of our “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan, and our positioning in convenience retailing, focused on our three key markets: daily food shopping, quick meal solutions and new everyday services.” Q2 SALES AND H1 2025 RESULTS In Q2 2025, net sales amounted to €2,077m, up +2.4% on a like-for-like basis and down -0.4% in total, after taking into account a -0.3-pt calendar effect and the roughly -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network. In H1 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €4,077m, a rise of +0.5% like for like and decrease of -2.7% in total, after taking into account a -0.7-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network. Group adjusted EBITDA came in at €286m (+12.2%), reflecting a margin of 7.0% (+93 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €55m (vs. €26m in H1 2024). Monoprix MONOPRIX Actions to streamline the store network resulted in the closure of 10 stores and the opening of 7 new outlets in Q2 2025 (13 closures and 11 openings in H1 2025). The highlight of the quarter for Monoprix was the inauguration of its first three “La Cantine” food concept pilot stores at the beginning of April, in Paris (Beaugrenelle) and in the Paris region (Neuilly-sur-Seine and Colombes), with promising initial results and a positive effect observed in the other sections of these pilot stores. Monoprix plans to extend the concept to around ten stores by the end of the year. FRANPRIX Customer traffic jumped +7.2% in Q2 (after a +2.4% increase in Q1 and a +1.8% increase in Q4 2024) as a result of strong sales momentum: (i) the "prix francs" (fair prices) campaign in Q1, with prices cut and frozen on 30 private-label products, (ii) the launch of the new "le +bibi" loyalty programme in May 2025, (iii) the development of services with the launch of the "franpclés" key copying service at the end of June and the restart of the “Nannybag” luggage security service for the summer period.Actions to streamline the Franprix network continued during the quarter, with 22 store closures, 9 openings, and 1 conversion from integrated to the franchise/business lease model (40 closures, 17 openings and 6 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year, the Franprix brand also pursued initiatives targeting franchisees; in particular, seven B2B promotional campaigns. Casino CASINO The store network saw 332 stores leave the network in Q2 2025 (including 263 Magne master franchisee stores), 45 store openings and 37 transfers from integrated stores to the franchise/business lease format (768 exits, 64 openings and 48 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year, various actions targeting franchisees were carried out by the Casino, Spar and Vival brands, in particular (i) implementing dedicated B2B promotional campaigns, and (ii) developing additional features in the CPRO ordering tool (suggested product replacements, display of back-in-stock dates for out-of-stock items, display of actual use-by dates when ordering, implementation of inventory reduction measures with discounts for franchisees), and (iii) stepping up collaboration with franchisees by involving them in working groups focused, in particular, on logistics and customer loyalty.H1 also saw the roll-out of new concepts: (i) unification of Le Petit Casino and Casino Shop brands under a single Casino brand in urban areas, (ii) roll-out of the “Cœur de Blé” quick meal solutions concept with the opening of 5 Cœurs de Blé corners in stores in H1 and 70 openings planned by the end of the summer, and (iii) the launch of the new Spar “Origines” concept, a locally integrated, flexible and user-friendly concept offering an expanded range, an increase in the surface area dedicated for fast food and practical services for everyday needs. Naturalia NATURALIA E-commerce sales also performed well in Q2, with double-digit growth for the brand's website (+13.9%), while the quick commerce partnership with Uber Eats continues to roll out, covering 38 stores at end-June 2025. The brand continues to enjoy solid growth in customer traffic (up +8.5% in Q2, vs. +8.2% in Q1 and +6.7% in Q4 2024) and a loyal customer base (74% of net sales generated by loyalty card holders). As with the Group's other brands, Naturalia also developed its quick meal solutions offer during the first half of the year, with the launch of a test phase for an organic snack concept in six stores (including three at the end of June). Initial results are encouraging, with additional net sales growth seen in the first few weeks of operation in the first three pilot stores. Naturalia closed 2 stores in Q2 2025 (11 closures and 1 transfer from an integrated store to a business lease in H1 2025). Cdiscount CDISCOUNT This performance was supported by the brand’s significant reinforcement, driven by the marketing relaunch, including an ambitious media plan during winter and summer sales, and operational excellence (record NPS levels, enhanced product assortment and improved after-sales service), which enabled the positive momentum in new customer acquisition to continue (+37% in H1 2025), allowing the active customer base to start growing again. Against this backdrop, Cdiscount net sales – which, logically, had been impacted by the strategy of streamlining direct sales in previous quarters – remained stable in Q2 2025, confirming the sequential improvement underway for over one year. This performance was also underpinned by +9% growth in revenues from Cdiscount Advertising in Q2 2025, while B2B revenues from C-Logistics and Octopia6 declined by -7%. Other and Quatrim QUATRIM & OTHER Consolidated trading profit was -€11 million (compared with -€56 million in H1 2024). Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses amounted to -€20m in H1 2025 (vs. -€609m in H1 2024), including (i) +€70m from asset disposals, mainly real estate disposals, (ii) -€66m of asset impairment losses, including -€47m of goodwill impairment, and (iii) -€14m of restructuring costs. Net financial expenseA net financial expense of -€179 million was recognised in H1 2025, compared with net financial income of €3,262m in H1 2024 (including €3,486m relating to the conversion of debt into equity and the fair value adjustment of reinstated debt). Net financial expense breaks down mainly into (i) net cost of debt of -€94m, (ii) interest expense on lease liabilities of -€74m and (iii) the financial cost relating to CB4X8 (Cdiscount) of -€8m. Consolidated net profit (loss), Group share Profit (loss) from continuing operations, Group share came out at a loss of €204m, compared with a profit of €2,549m in 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations, Group share, was -€6m in H1 2025 (compared with -€2,511m in H1 2024), reflecting (i) +€16m from hypermarkets and supermarkets, and (ii) -€21m from GPA. Consolidated net profit (loss), Group share amounted to a loss of -€210m vs. profit of €39m in H1 2024. Free cash-flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations In first-half 2025, free cash-flow improved by +366m to -€48m (-€413m in H1 2024). Excluding the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023, free cash-flow would have increased by +€213m. Financial position at 30 June 2025 Consolidated net debt stood at €1.4bn, increasing by €205m from 31 December 2024, mainly impacted by real estate disposals (+€111m), cash-flows from discontinued HM/SM operations (-€185m), financial expenses (-€83m) and free cash-flow before financial expenses of -€48m. At 30 June 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of €522m, of which €307m was immediately available10. The maturity of the debt, excluding Quatrim, is 1.88 years without an extension option, and 2.03 years with an extension option. In the light of these factors, the Group will pay specific attention to changes in its financial structure in the coming months. Liquidity at 30 June 2025 At 30 June 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.24bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Discontinued operations In H1 2025, the Group paid €185m in costs related to discontinued HM/SM operations, mainly reflecting the gradual unwinding of employment protection plans, store closure expenses and working capital. At 30 June 2025, the net amount remaining to be disbursed in respect of discontinued HM/SM operations was estimated at €300 million, mainly comprising (i) €160 million employment protection plan costs and (ii) €120 million contract termination costs related to the HM/SM disposals. Covenants Net leverage ratio12 It should be noted that, although the calculation is required by the loan documentation since Q1 2024, the covenant is indicative at this time ("holiday period") until 30 September 2025 (exclusive). The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 9.75x at 30 June 2025; EBITDA forecasts for Q3 2025 are to ensure compliance with the minimum ratio requirement of 8.34x to be met at 30 September 2025. Minimum liquidity Liquidity of €1.24bn at 30 June 2025.On the last day of each month, liquidity must be at least €100m. Projected liquidity Liquidity is projected to be a minimum of €0.97bn in Q3 2025.At the end of each quarter, cash forecasts must show liquidity of at least €100m at the end of each month of the following quarter Market environmentThe Group operates in a market marked by the following trends: Objectives The Group is maintaining its objective of returning to break-even free cash-flow before financial expenses in 2026, as set out in its Renouveau 2028 strategic plan. A press release and a presentation of the plan are available on the Company's website.

For almost 20 years, this partnership has enabled Casino to offer customers of Avia Thevenin & Ducrot stores a varied selection of products under the Casino brand. The partnership covers 46 motorway service stations (including 39 operated under the Casino Express banner) and 41 urban or suburban service stations (including 11 under the Casino Express banner). In May 2025, Monoprix and the Zouari family signed an agreement to franchise 27 Monop' stores as part of the joint venture between Monoprix and the Zouari family. This transaction is part of Monoprix’s strategy to step up sales momentum in its network and accelerate its development with the support of a long-standing partner. In May 2025, Casino Group signed a strategic partnership with Moroccan group H&S Invest Holding, with plans to open more than 210 Franprix and Monoprix brand stores over the next ten years throughout Morocco. Aura Retail alliance The first purchases made under Aura Retail contracts have been in effect since 1 March 2025. On 23 September 2024, Intermarché, Auchan and Casino Group signed a long-term purchasing partnership with the creation of the Aura Retail alliance, offering purchasing partnerships between the three groups for a period of ten years (see the press release). Real estate disposals The Group disposed real estate assets for €132m in H1 2025, including €92m through Quatrim and its subsidiaries: During H1 2025, the Group made payments of €102m to the creditors of its secured Quatrim debt, enabling reduction of the nominal value of this debt to €218m at 30 June 2025. A further payment of €20m is scheduled for 1 August, bringing the total to €198m. Voluntary buy-out offer and delisting of Cnova N.V. Following the voluntary buy-out offer for the shares of Cnova N.V. (at a price of €0.0958 per share including statutory interest) initiated by Casino, and in accordance with the judgement rendered by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam, the Netherlands on 11 February 2025, the Cnova N.V. shares not tendered to the offer (i.e., 504,252 Cnova shares in total) were transferred to Casino on 19 June 2025 following the deposit of the corresponding funds (i.e., a total amount of €48,307.34) with the Dutch Consignment Fund. As Casino consequently holds 100% of the capital and voting rights of Cnova, Cnova N.V. shares were delisted from Euronext on 24 June 2025, as announced in the press release dated 20 June 2025 (press release link).

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Airlines Get Passengers to Accept AI-Driven Personalized/Surveillance Pricing?

Yves here. The individualized price gouging that Delta plans to implement seems to be coming soon. But as Hubert Horan explains, this case of “AI is coming to eat your lunch” does not look as easy to pull off as Delta might think. Even so, Congresscritters are already saddling up to head Delta off at the pass. The proposed bill below is in addition to objections raised by three Senators that Hubert mentions below. You shouldn’t be charged more or paid less because of your ZIP code or search history. I just introduced a bill to ban “surveillance pricing” — when corporations use your data to hike up prices or cut your wages. It’s invasive. It’s exploitative. And it needs to end. pic.twitter.com/4vOn6AFPF2 — Congressman Greg Casar (@RepCasar) July 27, 2025 The Economist just reported on another ruse that some US airlines tried implementing. It falls short of the individual pricing threat, but still got travelers’ dander up: In recent years airlines have grown ever more sophisticated in their pricing techniques. American carriers’ latest method of singling out business passengers, though, is strikingly simple—and has sparked outrage in the travel blogosphere. In May Thrifty Traveler, a website about travel bargains, reported that America’s three big legacy airlines—American, Delta and United—had started charging higher per-person fares for single-passenger bookings than for identical itineraries with two people. Kyle Potter, the author, grumbled that the practice amounted to carriers “weaponis[ing] their fares” against solo travellers who “can’t clone themselves”. Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, another travel site, called it “greed getting out of control” and said that airlines were “asking for government intervention”. Although no airline has yet commented on the subject, Delta and United reportedly scrapped the practice amid the criticism. To investigate further, The Economist turned to Serpapi, an automated interface to Google Flights, a fare database. For all direct domestic journeys on America’s three big legacy carriers, we downloaded one-way main-economy fares as of July 20th for one and two passengers to travel on Monday July 28th, choosing whichever flight had an airline’s cheapest single-passenger price for that route that day. We also pulled return fares—one the following Friday and the other on Saturday—for both one and two passengers. In total, we amassed 19,000 prices across 3,200 routes. Delta has indeed abandoned the technique: its two-passenger price is always at least twice the fare for one. But American and United have persisted. Solo flyers who travel with them within the work week can end up paying more than everyone else, including solo travellers whose journey involves a weekend stay and those who travel with others, regardless of whether their trip stretches into a weekend. In other words, airlines are exposed to consumer backlash, and even, as regulated entities, political pressure. So individualized pricing were to get traction, some airlines could tout their abstention. I could see Middle Eastern carriers, like Qatar Air and Emirates, which cater to a high end clientele, advertising that they don’t nickel and dime customers this way. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016 Delta’s President Glen Hauenstein told investors that it sees AI-driven personalized (or surveillance) pricing as “a full re-engineering of how we price, and how we will be pricing in the future”. He said “we’re really excited about partnering with Fetchrr” (Delta’s Israel-based AI consultant) whose tools were helping Delta “get inside the mind of our consumer” so that eventually, “we will have a price that’s available on that flight, on that time, to you, the individual.” He said that AI tools were now setting prices on 3% of Delta flights but he expected 20% of flights would be AI priced by the end of 2025.[1] The definition of personalized/surveillance pricing is well understood and represents a radical departure from other forms of algorithmic pricing. [2] Algorithmic pricing simply means that many of the rules (algorithms) governing when prices should be adjusted in response to new information about consumer demand or competitor actions have been automated. Airlines pioneered pricing automation in the 1980s, which incorporated second degree price discrimination, so different fares can be offered on flights with higher or lower demand, and different fares can be offered with different conditions (advance purchase requirements, different checked baggage or seat assignment surcharges). But under second degree price discrimination every consumer sees the exact same price offering at any given time. Every consumer has the identical opportunity to pay less if they buy in advance and can only sit in the very back of the plane or pay more at the last minute and sit closer to the front. Delta is reengineering its pricing around using first degree price discrimination. Personalized/surveillance data is used to estimate the maximum price each individual would be willing to pay. Individuals would no longer see the same prices that all others are seeing. Any claims that first degree price discrimination would improve overall efficiency or benefit consumers are false. The original use of second degree price discrimination in the 80s did improve efficiency and consumer welfare. Price sensitive customers who were willing to buy tickets on lower demand in advance got much lower fares than previously available, and more time-sensitive customers willing to pay more got greater access to higher demand flights at the last minute. Airlines achieved much higher capacity utilization (load factors), earned much more revenue on flights that had previously been half empty, and avoided the huge expense of adding aircraft that were only needed at peak periods. But the efficiency gains from price discrimination were exhausted long ago. Increased price discrimination would only be a wealth transfer from consumers to airline shareholders. To use simplistic Economics 101 terminology, when everyone sees a standard market price, a consumer surplus is created because some consumers would have been willing to pay more. First degree price discrimination using personalized/surveillance pricing attempts to eliminate as much of that consumer surplus as possible by charging each customer the most they would be willing to pay. Passengers pay more without getting anything of value in return. Lots of companies have tried to introduce personalized/surveillance pricing but corporate announcements including Delta’s usually generate consumer backlash. Three Democratic Senators complained that this could support predatory pricing and demanded that Delta disclose what information about individual consumers it would be using to set prices. [3] Airline passengers understand that airlines don’t have their best interests in mind, can quickly see through attempts to claim first degree price discrimination is the same thing as traditional second-degree discrimination and readily dismiss ludicrous attempts to claim personalized/surveillance pricing will actually lead to lower prices. [4] The shift from second degree to AI-driven first-degree price discrimination would be one of the biggest aviation changes in decades. So I went to the Fetcherr website and found surprisingly that it said that its airline AI offerings don’t actually do any of the things Hauenstein was claiming. [5] They don’t collect data about individual customers or analyze the price elasticities or other characteristics of individual customers or fine-tuned customer segments. Fletchrr emphasizes that its AI/data tools are designed to be easily integrated into existing pricing practices and there is absolutely no suggestion they were designed to help an airline to completely reengineer its pricing function. Something is seriously wrong here, but what? Are Delta and/or Fletchrr being less than honest about what they are doing? Major investments in AI tools are only appropriate in cases where a company needs to process massively greater amounts of external data than before and wants to divine correlations that human analysts using PC based software could never find. Large Language Models identify text patterns that can help automate preparation of article summaries and documents. Activity specific models find correlations between millions of historical inputs and outputs that can support the automation of basic tasks like coding or accounting. Two major AI applications are especially relevant here. The primary “get inside the mind of the consumer” case is advertising, where large companies like Google and Facebook used their access to massive amounts of data about individual users to program real-time ads more effectively than traditional human marketing analysts. The primary “use Big Data to totally re-engineer previously human+PC software analytical functions” came in the 1990s when hedge funds used hitherto unprecedented amounts of computing power to find factors correlated with asset price changes that drove more higher average returns and incorporate them into high-speed computerized trading strategies. [6] One possible explanation for these apparent contradictions is that Fletchrr doesn’t understand airline pricing very well. Its founders come from the hedge fund world where AI tools are critical because there are millions of traders, billions of transactions, individual markets are highly volatile, can be influenced by an unpredictable range of external factors, and major traders are constantly changing their strategies. Fletchrr never explains why this experience would apply to airlines where supply and demand are highly stable in the short/medium term, the number of airline competitors is limited and while their pricing approaches can evolve over time they haven’t changed dramatically or unexpectedly in decades. Why did Fletchrr see airlines as a prime target for its AI sales efforts? Because they thought airlines were “outdated” “undisrupted” and had seen few recent technological advances. In fact, airlines were perhaps the non-military industry quickest to drive innovation in operations research, IT technology, and modern pricing/distribution tools, and of course saw business models totally transformed in the last quarter of the 20th Century. They may not seem highly dynamic to someone whose experience is limited to the recent development of hedge fund quant models, but very few industries anywhere experience that rate of technological change. Fletchrr says airlines need AI tools to handle today’s faster rate of change, but the only examples of hard to handle change it offered were nonsensical–the impact of Covid on demand and the challenge of previously unscheduled flights into Doha for the FIFA World Cup. Fletchrr doesn’t provide any concrete examples of major problems it can solve that current pricing systems can’t deal with. The input data for Fletchrr’s AI market model is the exact same input data airline revenue management systems have been using for decades. There might be value in a tool that can quickly process greater volumes of input data; every corporate function could be improved at the margin, and perhaps these gains would justify the IT investment. But these would be marginal improvements, would not represent the complete reengineering of pricing that Delta claimed, or anything that could produce the major revenue/profit impacts that would justify major announcements to investors. Another possible explanation is that Delta executives never thought through the requirements, potential gains and implementation risks of re-engineering its existing systems into personalized/surveillancepricing. Perhaps Delta never bothered to figure out that Fletchrr’s software was only offering marginally greater automation of traditional pricing tasks and never considered that Fletchrr’s software wasn’t designed to drive the dramatic changes it thought its investors would value. Delta hasn’t made any attempt to define the shortcomings in its existing pricing systems that it is hoping to address or explain how a future reengineered system would differ from today’s. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere and never stopped to consider whether the conditions that allowed AI tools to create value in other industries applied here. Perhaps Delta executives more cynically thought that splashy announcements of big AI projects would juice the stock price, would reinforce Delta’s image of having more progressive management than United or Delta, and assumed that investors would never hold management accountable if there wasn’t a big revenue/profit boost. Even if it is I possible that Fletchrr’s hedge fund trained AI experts overestimated the applicability of its tools to airlines and that Delta management accepted too much AI hype it seems rather improbable that both these two sophisticated companies would announce a major effort where the goals were badly misaligned. One more plausible explanation is that Fletchrr fully understands that Delta is determined to achieve first degree price discrimination, and both parties wanted to obscure this. It could be that Fletchrr knew its AI-driven Market Model was well suited for personalized/surveillance pricing but deliberately excluded any mention of this from its promotional material to help shield airline clients from external criticism in cases like this. Fletchrr’s website gives Delta a way to plausibly deny outside critics (“that’s not what these AI tools do!”) without having to formally disavow their pursuit of personalized/surveillance pricing. It could be that Fletchrr’s models were never designed to process huge volumes of personal information but Delta believe they can be adopted to support first degree price discrimination. It remains possible that Delta’s effort to use AI-driven personalized/surveillance pricing will fail to materially boost profitability. The articles reporting Hauenstein’s claim mentioned a range of potential obstacles to personalized/surveillance pricing including the ready availability of data on market (non-personalized) prices that would allow flyers to see if Delta was trying to get them to pay above-market fares. While it is widely understood how Google and Facebook can use terabytes of personal data to tailor ad displays, no one has publicly explained how personal data would allow an airline to calculate price elasticities for each customer and reliably predict that this individual shopping for this specific flight would be willing to pay more than it was asking other customers to pay. It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Many observers assume that first degree price discrimination would require forcing most passengers to not only grant Delta access to much more personal information than they have now, but to force them use Delta-controlled sales channels. A recent American attempt to force corporate agents serving higher yielding passengers to use a captive channel actually reduced revenue by over a billion dollars and was withdrawn. [7] Delta’s best customers might similarly resist any attempt to force them to use a channel that prevented them from seeing what true market rates were. Uber provides a case example of a company where shifting to first degree price discrimination did produce a very large profit boost. Uber previously offered the same fare to any customer and offered the same payment to any driver (based on factors such as distance and time of day) with a system that estimated the highest fare/lowest payments they would accept.[8] But if Delta was attracted to personalized/surveillance pricing by the big profit boost Uber achieved it may be badly disappointed because Delta has none of the structural advantages that allow Uber to maximize exploitive discrimination. Uber rides are last minute purchases and riders have no ability to compare prices. There are no independent Google/Kayak/Expedia-type sources of true market taxi pricing information. Delta frequent flyers understand airline pricing and would quickly figure out if changes were unfavorable. Uber users have no real idea how Uber pricing works, and Uber (and Lyft) have achieved quasi-monopoly pricing power after using billions in predatory subsidies to drive independent competition out of the market. It should be emphasized that the central issue, should Delta have any success pursuing first degree price discrimination is not “AI technology” or “pricing algorithms” but the ability to exploit anti-competitive market power. Simplistic Economics 101 models say producers can’t achieve the capture of consumer surplus that Delta hopes to achieve using first degree price discrimination because consumers would be protected by market competition and the availability of perfect information about market prices. First degree price competition works for Uber because they tightly control all marketplace information, have eliminated all meaningful competition and any ability of elected officials to enforce consumer and labor law protections. Even Uber investors have no ability to see how pricing and driver compensation changes affect profitability. Thus any attempt to implement first degree price discrimination requires subverting the proper workings of competitive markets. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to force its best customers to use Delta controlled distribution channels, or to limit their ability to see if Delta is only showing them fares higher than other customers can get. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to blow off customer backlash, negative publicity and complaints from Congress. The ability to impose first degree price discrimination should perhaps be seen as prima facie evidence that a company has artificial anti-competitive market power. While normal companies that achieved a multi-billion profit recovery would aggressively publicize the brilliance of its management moves, Uber management has gone to great lengths to keep the public from becoming aware that it made a major shift to first order price discrimination and that that shift was the major reason Uber finally became profitable. Uber understands that a greater awareness of passenger/driver exploitation could not only drive serious customer/political backlash but create awareness that its profitability had nothing to do with management brilliance but was driven entirely by the subversion of market competition. Delta might rationally believe that it already has the artificial market power to pursue personalized/surveillance pricing while ignoring the objections of its best customers but Uber management might warn them to take these risks more seriously. American’s CEO has already called Delta’s proposed pricing shift a “bait and switch” plan.

I could very easily see this happening. I travel a lot on Delta, and I believe I have been targeted in this way in recent months. The increase in business class fare offerings has been amazing and I believe that once you’ve shown a willingness to pay $2k for a cross-country seat or $10k for an overseas flight, for a business trip where your dates are not flexible [and you’re being reimbursed], that’s what they’re going to show you for all travel from now on. But I don’t believe they can fill the cabin that way. Many users are sucked into the loyalty program or (like me) limited to certain airlines based on a smaller home airport, but if they’re going to price gouge, and other airlines refrain, I’m going elsewhere. Hopefully the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can save me . . . oh, wait. But if you really think about it, they are mostly targeting the PMC here, so maybe there will be some legislative pushback after all. I don’t know if it’s the result of AI, but something changed with Delta’s domestic pricing recently. I fly the same route regularly, and within the past few weeks the price of the particular ticket I usually buy increased substantially in comparison to other options. The result is (1) for the first time in quite a while I checked Expedia to see what my other options are, and (2) I will buy the cheapest ticket instead of the one I usually buy. I also noticed on my last few flights that the relative number of people boarding in the last (cheapest ticket) group has increased substantially, and the flights are not as full. Maybe that benefits Delta somehow, but I don’t really understand how. Unclear whether what you saw is related to the recently announced software program, which is still in early testing. But it could have been the result of a previous cruder non-AI algorithm Delta was using. As I mentioned it is well understood that frequent travelers fly for a wide variety of reasons over time with widely divergent price elasticities and no one has ever explained how any “personalized” system could afjust prices for each different situation My recommendation to anyone who thinks they have been a victim of first degree price discrimination is to quickly look up fares on an internet travel agency (Kayak, Expedia, etc) or signin to Delta with the ID of a spouse/friend who doesn’t have a similar usage of full-fare/premium tickets. Take screen shots. If its clear you’ve been offered a higher-than-market fare, complain to Delta with a “why are you trying to gouge me?” email After I wrote the comment I had my wife look up the same itinerary on her phone. The particular ticket I usually buy was significantly less than was offered to me, while the other fares were the same. I went back to double check and I was still being offered the higher rate. They will now have some solid information about my elasticity. The airlines are presumably not the only ones who can play this high tech arbitrage game, and they could wind up hoisted on their own petards. What is to stop some enterprising young nerdbox from developing a bot with the profile that would cause it to be offered the lowest price, and then buy up all the tickets for a given flight and sell them on the secondary market? If it can be done with tickets to concerts and sporting events, why not plane tickets too? When you buy a plane ticket you have to enter your passport or some form of ID. The ticket is not transferable. At least this is my experience. Nice thought though! Turning the tides on them and all Huh? Not in the US or when I buy international tix to Southeast Asia. I provide the passport # only at check in time. Expat2uruguay, I haven’t traveled much since 9-11, so my memory of buying tickets for travel and procedures at the airport when one is checking in is quite rusty. I did a cursory search on transferability of tickets and found that most airlines don’t allow it, and the few that do generally charge fees to do a name change. Sometimes the fee itself can be so expensive that it makes more sense to purchase a new ticket for the person who will actually be flying. Regardless, the person showing up for the flight has to produce an acceptable-to-TSA I.D. which matches the name on the ticket. That alone would preclude the idea that lyman alpha blob proposed. Hope this helps. I booked a flight to the UK for October and have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization, which I did not have to do when I flew there last year. https://www.gov.uk/eta They want photos of my passport and of my face. Not surprised. Last time I renewed my UK passport they demanded to see my other passports. Rather than send sensitive data electronically (which I don’t think is their business anyway) I paid to travel by train to their UK hub office and simply showed them my Aussie passport making sure they couldn’t take pics of complete info. Yes. The EU is doing the same thing; they were trying to roll it out for this summer but they couldn’t get it done in time. Next year you’ll need another EVisa for the EU countries. While maybe the AI will make it worse but fare manipulation has been know about for years if not decades. What day of the week you look or buy, did you look recently, and location etc all of which means you’re presented with higher prices. I know I’ve seen this happen to me before. And definitely not for biz/first class. > It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Patently false. My former mentor (Louviere) made his name originally by doing PRECISELY this for Qantas in the early 1980s using (what were at that point pretty primitive) discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and often used the very bad “conjoint analysis” techniques which he later freely disavowed calling most of his early 1980s research “crap and not worth reading”. But DCEs have been used to map demand functions for years, and these days with the rise of the web and online panels, map them under all those different types of contexts mentioned. The most successful applications are not ones you’ll find referenced….I’ve mentioned before the one that flew under even our radar (macquarie bank’s use of them which I discovered by accident). It’s such cases that should really worry people. My point that individual elasticities cannot be measured was in the context of an airline booking system that has to deal with millions and millions of booking/fare inquiries and needs to decide instantaneously what to show to each specific individual. My dubiousness reflects some familiarity with attempts in the past (perhaps including the QF example you cited) that were totally useless plus some other issues. What I’d seen in the past wasn’t based on individuals but on market segment categories, e.g. investment bankers, salespeople, government employees, people who attended a given trade fair every year) with the aggregate elasticity estimate applied to anyone placed in that category. Also useless in real world airline pricing. But if you have any studies that purport to estimate individual elasticities in a large scale operational setting that you think might be somewhat legitimate, please let me know Thanks for engaging. I’ll clarify as much as I can. As you might have guessed, a load of Louviere’s work with Qantas was not published as it was commercially sensitive. The stuff that WAS published (like the “conjoint” stuff using rating scales) was garbage (as subsequently said by the man himself). Thus if you want a good well known empirical example there is one which won the “Nobel” in Economics: Dan McFadden’s construction of the demand curve for the (not even yet built) BART in SF Bay Area, based on a synthesis of revealed preference data (what choices people ACTUALLY made in real life) PLUS stated preference data (what they’d do when given hypothetical but realistic scenarios). McFadden’s results were proven correct once BART was built. It is the ultimate example of how we can map out the demand function pretty easily, if you put in the work. Online panels make it trivially easy. My worry here was the siloisation of academia: nobody looking into other fields to see if something had been solved there. DCEs are sometimes criticised because the respondents aren’t sufficiently familiar with the options on offer. Most passengers on flights know exactly what everything entails and I designed surveys to give real time results on people’s trade-offs. The “what to show an individual” is trivial and I have zero doubt that big airlines have been using DCE data to do this for YEARS. We’ve gone WAY beyond the market segment objection you made. I can model individuals. I don’t need to use ANY inter-individual data or inferences. I describe this in my book. We were doing this over 10 years ago with no AI. PS AI is actually not the “big bad wolf” here. By its very nature it scrapes existing data (flight characteristics) already out there. In other words, it uses data from what traditional economists would recognise as the production possibility frontier and the points that actually got “activated” by intersections with the demand curve. Points that are currently not implemented (think of the iPhone just before its launch) cannot be modeled using AI data. People don’t yet know enough about the product characteristics and if you scrape existing data on characteristics of existing phones (think those stylus Windows phones up to 2009ish) then you’ll get horridly confounded estimates. The “artificial but realistic” data from a DCE is essential (and I stress again, following proper education of the respondents about what it could potentially do) in estimating demand surfaces (since we’re in multi dimensional space). The issue of price discrimination should’ve been addressed 15 years ago when my old industry learnt how to do it brilliantly and way before AI. Indeed AI should be criticised for loads of reasons but this is not a valid one. We shot ourselves in the foot years ago. I think they will because people really want to travel and have proven themselves to put up with any kind of humiliation from airlines and ”security checks”. Somewhat related, airlines make their money on their loyalty programs and credit cards. The high transaction fees make this work. Using points for tickets has become more challenging as airlines mostly use dynamic pricing for award tickets. Some now require login to display award pricing, so surveillance pricing is likely active for some. Data: US Airlines Operate As Loss Leaders For Their Loyalty Programs OMAAT Delta had a 10.5% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -2.5% margin United had an 8.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -1.9% margin American had a 4.8% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -8.3% margin Alaska had a 4.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -11.4% margin Southwest had a 1.2% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -19.9% margin The US carriers are all terrible now. They should take lessons from the big Asian or the ME3 airlines. I’m so old I remember fares printed in ink in schedules. And economy was a pleasant experience. Thank you Jimmy Carter for neoliberal crapification! Generally I agree but Ryanair was different. I don’t actually think it deserves the bad rap it gets. Not ACROSS THE BOARD anyway. I used it quite a bit 2009-2015 when I was living down under but attending Euro conferences (with trips to family tagged on). On the “non-bucket-holiday routes” I never had problems. You got what you paid for and expected. It was only the routes (often UK to certain popular holiday destinations) frequented by drunken idiots from my own home country of UK that made the flight awful. Ryanair has, IIRC remained profitable or at least not get hit anything like as bad as other carriers even in bad years like 2020. Of course I do wonder if an increasing amount of their profit comes from the abominable scratch cards etc they push on you….. It has been six years since I last flew commercial. Don’t miss it at all! The last airfare I paid was for vacation with son’s family, Granpa needed to be with Grandkids. Otherwise, too much business travel makes me rather drive 30 hours Thanks for this post. Thank Hubert! Whether prices are set by humans or AI, consumers will only purchase tickets if they consider the price to be reasonable. Regarding Uber and Lyft some anecdotal experience. I have found checking prices between them that Lyft is usually cheaper and when speaking to the drivers they get a higher percentage of the fare. In a recent situation my daughter used Uber and at the end of her ride the driver asked her what the fare was (as the driver couldn’t see it) and offered a $10 discount for a direct payment which my daughter did and the driver canceled the ride which resulted in no charge through the app. In major city airports there are taxi stands that often are significantly cheaper than using uber and readily available. I expect these work arounds will expand in time. In addition Waymo etc… is much cheaper and will also start cutting into Uber and Lyft’s profits. (No pesky driver to pay). As far as surveillance pricing for airlines and grocery stores I expect a great deal of on the ground resistance. Just as a reference point on AI… this is NOT intelligence or even ARTIFICIAL intelligence. As I and others keep pointing out this is not “intelligence” as people general think. This is just MASSIVE computing power. Companies have been doing this type of pricing, marketing and targeting for years! However, connecting a customer and his personal data (customer provided at the POS and ACQUIRED from other 3rd party sources) and computing a pricing target at the POS has only been a dream until recently. This is not “intelligence” this is massive computing power of data in a real-time fashion against a developed statistical model. Yes, the outputs may make senses for maximizing profits, but the pricing points do not come from any computer intelligence as we would recognize. That said, it doesn’t mean we’re screwed, but the elite have always been dreaming of that, how else are they to pay for their lifestyle. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere… Almost certainly this is the explanation. Horan, bless his heart, assumes that decisions about AI are made on the basis of hard-headed technical analyses. What we have been seeing in fact is that companies are adopting AI strictly out of a fear of missing out or being last to the party regarding the technology they don’t understand. This process is accelerated by the two or three companies that are pushing AI for all its worth. Fetchrr is clearly looking for ways to sell its snake oil to large businesses before the whole AI bubble collapses. Well, one advantage of government travel was GSA had contracted rates for just about anywhere you would need to go. Sometimes you could finesse this — flying from Oxnard CA to DC the contract was with United, but an option was a one-way car rental to LAX and American had the LAX-DCA contract. Way back when I was stationed in Crystal City in VA (how the Navy got kicked out of Main Navy on Constitution Ave and ended up in leased space in Arlington is a question for another day) I was a member of a locker room facility we used for jogging at lunch. There were some guys from US Air who were usually there (at the time they had some sort of offices at National) and they would always be discussing among themselves how airline X had changed its pricing on a certain route and how US Air should react. I guess from the days before software took it all over. Back then Piedmont had a monopoly on DC to Norfolk or Newport News flights, and it was always a question if it was better to drive it than fly. Google flights has served me well as it tracks price fluctuations anonymously. Price wars are quite evident there. I buy separate one-way tickets to fly round-trip US coast-to-coast every few months domestically. My “status” usually gets me front-economy seats on AA with some leg room and one free checked bag. Good enough even with AA’s ongoing deterioration to not bother with competition. Thankfully I no longer must fly to SA and Oz occasionally for work, and I can plan domestic trips several months in advance. it’s long been rumoured (long before “a/i” was a thing) that surfing with a mac usually results in higher prices than with a windows or linux machine. with my main browser, i used to spoof my user agent string. never proved a thing. cuz the user agent isn’t the only data used? who knows? Do Insurance next. Can of worms, I imagine. It’s always a good day when Hubert Horan has a new post. I just started reading the Vox article on this when I wandered to NC and here we are. I’ve read that some grocery stores are beginning to move this way. Unless they are immunized from civil rights laws, I can see many lawsuits for racial discrimination. It would be very easy to get a test group of people ‘of color’ with poor credit scores versus a control group of wealthy whites. Perversely, the algorithms will offer lower prices to the wealthier consumer with better credit. I’ve already wondered about Amazon’s exposure to this as I am sure they tailor their prices to the data they have on your purchasing history. Anyway, cheers to Hubert.

Title: As if the trade war never happened, stocks could pull off a feat not seen since the late-1990s boom

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The stock market has been on a hot streak lately, notching record high after record high, and some bulls on Wall Street think the party isn’t over. That marks a stunning reversal from the panic that gripped investors in April, when President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs shocked the world. Stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar crashed. Markets started pricing in a recession, and analysts slashed their forecasts. But Trump put his most aggressive tariff rates on hold, corporate earnings remained robust, consumers stayed resilient, and stocks rebounded. Even foreign investors jumped back into U.S. markets. Meanwhile, his administration has negotiated several trade deals, including one with the European Union on Sunday that removes the threat of a damaging trade war. Now that the fog of war is lifting, upbeat forecasts that predated Liberation Day are back, meaning stocks could put up big numbers again—as if the tariff shock from a few months ago was all just a bad dream. On Monday, Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus hiked his S&P 500 price target for this year to 7,100 from 5,950, reinstating the outlook he initially made in December 2024. “This year reminds us of the classic Charles Dickens quote, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'” he said in his latest note. “Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes at least for now.” He cited progress on trade negotiations, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve’s deft handling of monetary policy, which cooled inflation without causing a recession. If the S&P 500 hits 7,100 this year, it would represent a gain of about 21% for 2025, marking a third straight year with a surge of more than 20%. That hasn’t happened since the late 1990s, when the U.S. economy and the stock market boomed. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the S&P 500 could reach 7,200 by mid-2026, explaining that he is starting to lean closer to that more optimistic “bull case” scenario. He cited strong earnings as well as AI adoption, the weak dollar, Trump’s tax cuts, pent-up demand, and expectations for Fed rate cuts in early 2026. Another member of the 7,000 club is Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, who has stuck by his S&P 500 forecast of 7,007 even during the trade war. Last week, he reaffirmed it, predicting big tech companies will continue fueling the stock market’s rally despite Trump’s trade policies. “What we’re seeing is the winners continue to win,” he told Bloomberg. “The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trend in AI that will continue.” And over the longer term, this decade still looks like it will be another “roaring 20s,” according to market veteran Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. On Monday, he backed his thesis, which he first posited in August 2020, as productivity advances, a wave of capital outlays, and the endurance of consumer spending will keep stocks buoyant. “If the remainder of the decade continues to play out as the Roaring 2020s, we predict that the S&P 500 will start the next decade at 10,000,” Yardeni wrote in a note. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Somnath Mukherjee: Sebi’s Jane Street order was the canary our market needed

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arbitrage or market manipulation? Jane Street believes it is an uber-efficient arbitrageur. It spotted pricing anomalies between index options and the index’s stock constituents, and used sophisticated trading models to profit from the arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) order has some interesting findings. On 17 January 2024, the expiry day for Bank Nifty derivatives, the index opened 2% lower due to weak earnings of some of its constituents. However, options on the Bank Nifty traded at a level where the implied price was higher, resulting in an anomalous price spread. JS did what textbooks tell us: buy stocks that make up the Bank Nifty while selling options on this index. The trade worked as textbooks say it would: the spread narrowed within six minutes. But here’s the twist: the total value of Bank Nifty stocks purchased was ₹572 crore while the total notional value of the options sold was ₹8,751 crore, which is more than 15 times. This oddity continued. By mid-day, JS had bought Bank Nifty stocks and futures worth over ₹5,000 crore and sold options worth over ₹30,000 crore. Arbitrage is about hedging, but one doesn’t hedge a bet on India winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by placing 15 bets on India not-winning it. So JS started selling its stock/futures positions. But liquidity in these segments is so low that its trades tanked prices, resulting in losses for JS in its long index positions. But its large short options position (5-6 times in notional exposure to its cash/futures positions) got settled at market close at a massive profit. In short, JS appeared to move prices in the illiquid leg of the market (cash/futures) so that it could profit from its large position in the liquid leg (options).

Either way, Sebi’s order has acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine to reveal potentially poisonous fumes in our capital markets. Fume 1—Lopsided market structure: India’s equity market is the second largest among emerging economies by market capitalization and volumes both. However, volumes are skewed—over 90% are in derivatives (futures and options or F&O), with options accounting for the bulk. The cash segment is shallow. Daily volumes in the shares of HDFC Bank, the largest Bank Nifty constituent, for instance, are only about ₹2,000 crore. To put this in context, the total equity assets under management of India’s mutual funds (MFs) are over ₹30 trillion, with ₹50-60,000 crore worth of flows every month. This skew causes distortions. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Jane Street’s secret sauce for Indian markets should be tested out Fume 2—Skewed tax structure: A small ₹5,000 crore trade could move prices because there is no countervailing Indian entity that’s able to provide liquidity by playing the other side of JS’s ‘arbitrage’ trades. The reason is simple—tax rules. In India, the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives is a fraction of what it is on stocks, incentivizing investors to move to F&O from the cash segment. Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) enjoy a large tax advantage over Indians. FPIs’ F&O trades qualify for capital-gains tax (and are taxed at 20% if short-term and 12.5% if long-term), but for Indian entities, the same gains are deemed to be income (taxed at 25% for corporates and 39% for individuals/trusts). Fume 3—Regulation stifles Indian institutions: For many years, FPIs provided the dominant share of liquidity in Indian stock markets. Over the last decade, Indian institutions, especially MFs, have risen in stature and now account for a larger share of India’s market capitalization and volumes than FPIs. This provides a diversified pool of liquidity in the cash segment. But in the F&O segment, a regulatory overhang prevents the creation of such counterweight liquidity. Why? Also Read: Jane Street: Gaming an outdated system is not necessarily illegal in India First, domestic institutional investors are mostly not allowed to use leverage, but FPIs are. Second, short-selling, which lets market participants act on bearish views, exists mostly in the realm of theory; its process is such that participation and liquidity are low. Third, a prudential aversion to leverage has left F&O trading as its only source. Bank lending to capital markets is heavily circumscribed and non-banking financial companies have limited capacity to lend. This reduces domestic market liquidity and pushes participants towards the F&O segment. Fourth, while there are all sorts of limits in equity markets, index options face none. This means participants can build positions in index options many times the stock position limits on the underlying stocks. Fifth, a very high proportion of market liquidity is concentrated in short-term options contracts. India is unique as a large market with zero liquidity in derivatives of more than three months tenor. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street interim order made India’s stock market sit up for good reason Solutions are within grasp: India’s financial markets are world class. So are its regulators (think of Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India). Diversified liquidity is the lifeblood of any well-functioning market. Small tweaks in tax laws, alongside a rethink on the flexibility afforded to Indian institutions (especially MFs) would be a great fresh start. The appointment of market-makers for longer-dated derivatives is another idea that is well-tested in India; in the 1990s, RBI licensed a slew of primary dealers as market-makers for government bonds with great results. India’s capital markets are valuable. Sebi has done its bit as the canary by highlighting emergent risks. It is time now to make space for fresh ideas so that the mine continues to prosper for India.

Title: Fast food fixer: 83-year-old Hungry Jack wants a five-minute plan for Domino’s Pizza

Some Australians might know that the man behind burger chain Hungry Jack’s is Jack Cowin. Another name for him could be Australia’s Burger King, given he owns the local rights to the brand. He has shaped vast swaths of the fast-food landscape, having brought KFC to Australia and being chairman of Domino’s Pizza, in which he is its biggest investor. At 83, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion, you might think the Canadian-born entrepreneur is enjoying retirement. The reality is the opposite. Cowin has taken over chief executive duties at Domino’s following a string of executive exits. The day after the resignation of global chief executive Mark van Dyck (who was seven months into the job) was announced, Cowin hosted a call to field questions from investors and analysts. Make no mistake: Domino’s chairman, now executive chairman, Jack Cowin is calling the shots at the pizza chain.Credit: Dan Peled “This company is not in disarray. The future, in my opinion, is bright,” Cowin declared. “There’s nothing wrong with this base business.” Zooming from his desk in a dark teal jumper, the billionaire businessman conceded a number of key issues that needed to be fixed, picking problems with each departed company chief. He wanted decisions made faster than van Dyck’s plan to do it – in five minutes, preferably, not five years. He also made no secret of his intention to wind back decisions made by van Dyck’s predecessor. “The Don Meij era was growth,” he said. Meij said his reason for leaving was the “sheer intensity” of being at the helm for 22 years. He once topped the charts as the highest-paid ASX chief executive. But under Meij’s watch, Cowin said too many new stores set up in countries such as Luxembourg, France, Japan have been loss-making for too long. “We have to correct that.” From left: Don Meij, Mark van Dyck and Jack Cowin.Credit: Peter Wallis But the conditions for success during that era were some of the best the pizza chain could have wished for. COVID-19 lockdowns keeping everyone at home created huge – but temporary – demand for food delivery. Fast-food customers and investors alike were grabbing a slice of Domino’s, which reached a share price record high of nearly $160 in September 2021. Since then, it hasn’t capitalised on the flash-in-the-pan success. Pizza sales have stalled. Profit predictions were downgraded three times in a year. “It has been this huge growth story for a long time. The last two or three years hasn’t [delivered] any growth,” said Tom Kierath, investment banking firm Barrenjoey’s head of consumer research. Investors fled the stock after van Dyck’s resignation was announced, sending the share price to little over a tenth of that peak to $16.96. Cowin was aware of the need to reassure rattled shareholders, with van Dyck’s departure coming so soon after Meij’s. The billionaire businessman has a personal stake – 25.7 per cent – in fixing this. “The business has got to do better. We’re custodians of other people’s money,” Cowin said. “But to make this business successful, we have to have growth, and we have to do it now rather than on a long-term basis.” Domino’s problems didn’t appear overnight. Many competitive edges that once made it a market leader have eroded over years. Meij sought to make Domino’s website and app best-in-class, spending nearly $23 million in half a year alone on digital platforms. The investment doesn’t appear to have generated high returns. “You had the Peloton bubble, you had the Lululemon bubble with everyone buying casual wear, and we had this Domino’s bubble because they were digitally well advanced beyond anyone else,” said food industry consultant and Titanium Food director Suzee Brain. “That gave them inflated confidence that they were the new flavour of the month. So they started some really massive expansion off the back of a false economy.” The rapid store roll-out across Europe and Asia, once a major sales driver, was reversing. In Australia, Domino’s couldn’t keep the sales spurt they enjoyed during the pandemic. Executive chairman Jack Cowin is unwinding a number of investments decisions made by former CEO Don Meij.Credit: Jamila Toderas “They weren’t able to keep a lot of those customers, because there’s another problem: the product is not all that great,” said Brain. “They’ve never marketed it because they make great pizza … But now, it actually needs to be about the pizza.” Domino’s is facing a more competitive and diverse fast-food landscape in which players such as Guzman y Gomez and El Jannah are attracting younger customers and US chains Five Guys and Wingstop are keen for their slice of the market. As Australia’s dominant pizza chain, industry watchers believe Domino’s must advocate more effectively for the entire pizza category. “As part of your ‘what we do for the kids for a family eating Sunday evening dinner’ [considerations], does Domino’s become part of the conversation more than it currently is? That’s the opportunity,” said one industry analyst who declined to be named. The business must become more profitable, Cowin has told investors. Ideally, this would happen through a sales uplift, but as there’s no guarantee of that, costs need to be pulled out of the business. As delivery aggregators Uber Eats and DoorDash eat Domino’s lunch, IT spending has been an early target. “Our technology is not any better than Uber’s and the other people that we have to deal with,” said Cowin. “If you don’t have a competitive advantage, let’s stop trying to recreate the wheel.” Franchisee profitability is a key priority for Domino’s, with weekly store sales ranging from $30,000 to $100,000, Cowin revealed. But margins were eroded by the spurt of high inflation across ingredients such as cheese as well as wages, fuel and electricity. Meij tried to pass this on by imposing a 6 per cent delivery fee, which backfired with customers who punished the move by buying fewer pizzas. “Relative price point becomes very important,” said Ten Cap co-founder and lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu. “This price increase for the fast-food category was just so wrong.” Several fund managers, stock pickers and analysts believe at least some dead weight needs to be shed. Domino’s should sell France and exit Japan, said outspoken stockbroker Angus Aitken. Barrenjoey’s Keirath agrees. “If they get Taiwan, right, is it going to move the dial? No, it’s becoming a distraction. The same in Malaysia,” he said. “What you do by staying in those markets is you dilute the core markets.” Recruitment is under way for Van Dyck’s replacement. But they will have to be someone who will have to play by the rules laid out by Cowin, who has made it clear he wants to see rapid change. “If you have a strong chair in place [who has] already said to the market, ‘well, that guy is not there because he’s not delivering on costs’, then the next person has to subscribe to that view,” said Ten Cap’s Liu. “When you have to focus on costs, you got to be a tough person. You can’t be a nice guy.” There are plenty who think Domino’s is still a good deal, such as Morningstar equity analyst Johannes Faul, who said the leadership instability has injected uncertainty in the short term but described the pizza chain as “a robust brand of the future”. “We do think Domino’s still has growth ahead of it. Quite significantly so,” Faul said. Aitken said there was still a “huge mass market” for Domino’s products. “The demise of Domino’s as a product is not apparent to us,” he said. “We think backing the No.1 [quick-service restaurant] money-maker over 50 years, when he has no friends, is a great time to back Jack Cowin and Domino’s.” Turning things around could take three years. “Jack might be in his 80s but he is hands-on and can fix this with the right team.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
