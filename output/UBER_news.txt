The government has put Ola Cabs (ANI Technologies Private Ltd) and Uber (Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd) under scrutiny after confirming in the Lok Sabha on 12 March that the cab aggregators have allegedly been charging different fares based on a phone’s operating system. The issue, flagged by members of parliament (MPs), raised concerns over algorithm-driven pricing models that may be discriminating against users depending on whether they book rides from an iPhone or an Android device.

In response to a question raised by MPs Balashowry Vallabhaneni and Ravindra Chavan, Union minister for consumer affairs Pralhad Joshi informed the Lower House that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had taken note of complaints about the alleged fare disparity and issued notices to Uber and Ola on 10 January 2025, seeking an explanation. "It has come to the notice of the Department of Consumer Affairs that ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd (Ola) and Uber India Systems Pvt. Ltd (Uber) are allegedly following price disparity for cab fares displayed on Android and iOS devices for identical rides," the minister said in the Lok Sabha. Also Read | How Uber and Lyft are gearing up for the robotaxi revolution "While both companies have denied any such practice, the matter has now been referred to the Directorate General (DG) for a thorough investigation," he added. Complaints suggest that for the same ride—with identical pick-up and drop locations, estimated travel time, and conditions—users booking via iPhones are being charged more than those using Android devices. If proven true, such differential pricing could be classified as an unfair trade practice under India’s consumer protection laws, specifically the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020, under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provisions. Also Read | Inside Ola Electric’s showdown with registration agencies The government has been tightening regulations in the digital marketplace, particularly with the E-commerce Rules 2020, which bar platforms from manipulating prices or engaging in discriminatory pricing based on arbitrary factors. The case is expected to test the extent to which Indian regulators can enforce transparency in digital services, where algorithms dictate pricing models. On 23 January, Mint reported that the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had issued a notice to Apple Inc. about alleged performance issues in specific iPhone models following a software update. According to the report, the CCPA, which functions under the department of consumer affairs, also sent notices to ride-hailing platforms Ola and Uber after receiving complaints about fare differences based on users' phone models. The notices to Apple, Ola, and Uber are part of the government's broader efforts to regulate digital and tech platforms in India. CCPA aims to address consumer grievances and ensure fair business practices, strengthening consumer confidence in the digital marketplace. The watchdog has also taken action against electric vehicle manufacturers, coaching institutes, travel-booking platforms, online marketplaces, consumer durables companies, influencers, and celebrities for misleading consumers or engaging in deceptive sales practices.

Title: Rivian’s Micromobility Incubator ‘Also’ Gets Surprise Debut

ByWilliam Roberson ByWilliam Roberson, Contributor. LAGUNA BEACH, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 07: Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the ... More Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 07, 2024 in Laguna Beach, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) Recently, when Rivian electric car company founder Robert “RJ” Scaringe introduced the R2S SUV and R2T pickup truck, he paid homage to Apple founder Steve Jobs’ iconic “one more thing” end-of-presentation-surprise strategy. Scaringe introduced not one unexpected vehicle—the R3—but also a second variant, the R3X, which has the automotive segment excited even though the new models are still a year or so from production. Watch the wink to Jobs at the 27:45 mark: Now, Scaringe and Rivian have announced another unexpected thing: a micromobility development company called Also, Inc. The products from Also will skew more toward personal use, although some micromobility products—especially e-bikes—are quickly becoming staples of the delivery industry, with workers contracting with companies such as Uber Eats, Doordash and others. Rivian has also produced tens of thousands of distinctive electric delivery vans for Amazon.com and recently began offering the vans for public sale. “Also will focus on small, lightweight vehicles that are designed to meet the global mobility transportation challenges of today and tomorrow,” Rivian said in a press release, with Scaringe adding “for the world to fully transition to electrified transportation, a range of vehicle types and form factors will be needed.” Also will be its own company, but will work closely with Rivian, much like Harley-Davidson and its e-moto spinoff LiveWire and Royal Enfield with its new electric motorcycle company Flying Flea (below). Chris Yu, Rivian’s VP of future programs, will be president of Also, according to Rivian’s press release. Additional funding for Also totaling over $100 million will come from investment company Eclipse, which is currently working with dozens of small tech startups. Other partners, so far unnamed, are reportedly involved. No specific products or timelines have been announced as of yet, but Scaringe has a history of paying attention to the mobility market, even while developing his full-size vehicles. According to tech tracking site TechCrunch, Scaringe will show an initial vehicle later this year, and strongly hinted it will be an affordable e-bike. TechCrunch said Scaringe and Rivian growth director and Eclipse partner Jiten Behl started talking about developing micromobility products just ahead of the pandemic. During the Covid years, TechCrunch said Christ Yu from bicycle and e-bike maker Specialized joined the effort. Bloomberg posted in early 2023 that Rivian was working on an e-bike, but details were scant. Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, one year after Tesla began production of its first model, the original Lotus-based Roadster. Rivian went public in late 2021 with a stock price near $130 per share, giving the company a massive market cap before they had produced many commercial vehicles. The first Rivian R1T electric pickup for commercial sale rolled off the assembly line in September of that year. The stock fell as the pandemic wore on and excitement over EVs waned. Rivian CEO Robert "RJ" Scaringe speaks at the unveiling of the Rivian R3X (R) and R3 electric ... More vehicles at the Rivian South Coast Theater in Laguna Beach, California, on March 7, 2024. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Today, Rivian shares remain in the teens and production continues for the company’s latest generation of R1S and R1T vehicles as well as the distinctive electric delivery vans. Rivian’s market cap has hovered around $10 to $20 billion since 2022, and the company turned its first official profit—$170 million—in the last quarter of 2024 after years of heavy losses as production scaled up. With many prospective EV buyers souring on Tesla vehicles due to CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement, Rivian’s profile has risen as of late. With President Trump’s fairly antagonistic relationship with (most) electric vehicles and a possible end of tax incentives of EV buyers, the move to release Also into the wild might be timely if the vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and not affected by tariffs. The vast majority of e-bikes, electric scooters and other micromobility products are manufactured in China, putting them at risk of price increases due to tariffs. Scaringe told TechCrunch he thinks many e-bikes are overpriced; a competitive domestic product with no tariff charges could have legs (or wheels) if production can scale quickly and import tariffs remain in place.

Title: Monica Lewinsky’s Guide to Pulling Off the Perfect April Fool’s Day Prank

Laughter. Oh, how we need laughter these days. The weight of the world is almost too much to bear. The news. The stock market. The price of (fucking) eggs. The fact that the third season of The White Lotus is almost over. Not that anyone asked, but I think April Fools’ Day 2025 is just what we need. (That and a time machine.) Though I was a sweet but serious kid, I always loved April Fools’ Day. Like Pajama Day at school, or my dad’s green pancakes on St. Patrick’s Day, any departure from the quotidian routine gave me a thrill. And that’s never changed. The origins of April Fools’ Day are murky. Some think it arose in the Middle Ages, when the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar shifted New Year’s Day from spring to January 1. Not everyone observes the holiday on April 1, but countries from France and Brazil to Iran and India dedicate at least one calendar day to jokes and pranks. (In Spain, they have an annual food fight.) There’s something heartwarming about a global norm, agreed to across cultures, that celebrates playfulness and laughter. We are so often divided, but laughter can bring us together. But why do I love this day so much? To find out, I did what every good (faux) investigative journalist does: I asked my therapist. Dr. H’s first impulse was to go dark. She said it could reflect unconscious rage or the desire for power in a relationship, since the goal of a prank is to put one over on someone—and laugh at them. I didn’t want to think that could be true of me. Do I have hidden rage lurking in my subconscious? Probably? (Shrug.) But also, what woman doesn’t? The rage theory didn’t land as a puzzle piece sliding into place. Fortunately, as I gave her some of my examples, she laughed and revised her opinion. For me, she said, it might be about connection. I love to laugh, and thinking deeply about how to laugh at somebody and with them is a way of showing I care. The Clinton impeachment sent the little prankster in me into hibernation (a global scandal will do that to ya). But a few years later, I reclaimed my playful side with the help of a friend and neighbor in NYC, Ann. Now Ann pranked people all year long…and she was good. But April Fools’ Day was her Super Bowl. From her I learned the two keys to success: Always start with a kernel of truth, and always go all in on the joke. My inability to keep a straight face was an obstacle, but technology eventually fixed that. Pranking over text became my specialty. So in a feeble attempt to bring some joy to you today, here are Monica Lewinsky’s Greatest April Fools’ Day Hits: The morning of April 1, I sent a group text to my mom, dad, stepmom, brother, and sister-in-law, saying: Morning. There will be an announcement that comes out today. I have my reasons which I’ll explain later, but so you’re not shocked, I decided to do ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Love you. Silence. Then more silence. A few minutes later, I got a call from my mom. My brother had called her worried and apoplectic. “What is she DOING?! She just gave a TED Talk!” (There might have been some expletives in there.) An hour after that, I got a text from my stepmom: “Please call your dad. He has not figured out this is a joke and is worried because with your bad ankles you’re not a great dancer. He’s called me three times.” To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with doing DWTS. It’s just not the obvious next step in taking back your narrative after giving a TED Talk! However you choose to celebrate this April Fools’ Day, I hope you make it a good one and laugh your ass off. Oh, and by the way, since I have this platform here, I was given permission to announce in the pages of Vanity Fair that I’m joining season four of The White Lotus. Location: the White House.

Title: Trump’s tariffs could push grocery prices even higher, but there are steps Canada could take to protect consumers

University of Toronto provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation CA. University of Toronto provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA-FR. View all partners The first months of Donald Trump’s presidency have been defined by a single word: tariffs. He has framed tariffs as a panacea to the woes of the American economy, promising they will restore the country’s manufacturing sector and reduce the national deficit. As the United States’ largest trading partner, Canada’s smaller economy is poised to suffer the most from a prolonged trade war. Although the price of all consumer goods will be affected, the grocery aisle has become a particular battleground. Canadians have remained defiant, with vows to “buy Canadian” already spurring rapid drops in the sale of American products. But with calls for the country to strengthen its economic backbone and reduce dependence on the U.S., perhaps it’s also time to consider rebooting Canada’s grocery sector to better serve Canadians as well. Read more: Canada is now in a trade war with the U.S. — here's what you need to know to prepare for it Rising grocery bills have been an ongoing concern for Canadians long before Trump’s inauguration. Today, an estimated 18 per cent of Canadians are struggling with food insecurity owing to persistent inflation and the rising cost of living. Food banks saw a record number of monthly visits in 2024 as a result. Yet, even as consumers feel the squeeze, Canada’s grocery giants have been posting record profits. Loblaw Companies Limited, whose supermarkets hold a dominant 28 per cent share of the sector, has become the poster child for this trend. In the final quarter of 2022, as Canadians were grappling with rapid inflation on their grocery bills, Loblaw posted $529 million in profits — up 30 per cent from the previous year. This has led customers to accuse Loblaw and other large grocery chains of profiteering, provoking both a 100,000 signature petition against “greedflation” and a month-long boycott of Loblaw chains. All this while Loblaw was still reeling from a bread price-fixing scandal yielding a $500 million antitrust settlement. Read more: Food giants reap enormous profits during times of crisis In response to the mounting concerns, the federal government met with the heads of Loblaw, Sobeys, Metro, Costco and Walmart in 2023 to discuss stabilizing grocery prices in Canada. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would threaten and later implement amendments to the Competition Act through Bill C-56, although these reforms were focused less on immediately lowering grocery bills and more on giving new tools to Canada’s competition watchdog. Another area of concern is the initiatives supermarket chains such as Loblaw and Metro have been investing their profits in. Since 2020, supermarkets in Canada have invested heavily in self-checkout aisles. While initially a concession to the social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, these kiosks have become a ubiquitous — and often unwelcome — part of the retail experience for both workers and consumers. Beyond the concern that self-checkouts pressure customers to perform more work, they have also increased the precarity of supermarket employees. These technologies generally reduce total worker hours and eliminate well-paying full-time positions, all with an eye towards boosting profit margins. Read more: The rise of robo-retail: Who gets left behind when retail is automated? Loblaw has also invested in automating their fleet of delivery vehicles, jeopardizing jobs in the logistics sector at a time when Canada’s unemployment rate, already struggling to recover, is expected to rise due to Trump’s tariffs. There is also the looming concern of dynamic pricing. Following the lead of American grocery stores such as Kroger, chains run by Loblaw, Metro and Sobeys have begun to implement electronic price tags. These tags enable retailers to instantaneously update prices based on supply and demand, similar to surge pricing on ride-sharing apps like Uber. While online commentators were quick to mock fast food chain Wendy’s for potentially using dynamic pricing to charge more for a Frosty on a hot day, this practice becomes more problematic as the availability of family staples like baby formula, which already experiences perennial scarcity, are affected by the trade war. There is little reason to believe Canada’s grocery industry will reform itself. Many of the pro-consumer and pro-worker initiatives put forth by these chains have amounted to little more than public relations moves. The much-lauded COVID hero pay for front-line grocery workers disappeared only months into the pandemic, despite pressure from unions and MPs during the Omicron wave. Loblaw’s widely publicized price freeze on No Name products was similarly criticised for its short duration and for merely repackaging seasonal price freezes as a pro-consumer initiative. The company’s promise to create a discounted version of its already discounted grocery chain No Frills drew further scepticism, with the stock being entirely sourced from Loblaw brands that generate higher revenue for the company. The question remains: what concrete measures can be implemented to safeguard Canadian grocery bills as our country navigates this next crisis? A report from the Broadbent Institute suggests the idea of a windfall profit tax, which would incentivize grocery companies to invest excess profits into price reductions or higher wages. A more durable reform would involve creating a central bank-style regulatory entity to oversee the grocery industry, instead of relying on industry-born measures such as Canada’s recently introduced grocery code of conduct. Read more: The new Grocery Code of Conduct should benefit both Canadians and the food industry Federal or provincial legislation could be also passed that places guardrails on dynamic pricing in the grocery aisle, if not banning the controversial practice altogether. Government grants and tax incentive programs could be withheld from companies that invest heavily into automating workforces so the government isn’t inadvertently subsidizing job losses. The Competition Bureau’s 2023 report highlights another key issue: there is a need for all levels of government to shift from subsidizing large chains and encourage the growth of independent grocers in the Canadian market, driving down prices for consumers through meaningful, local competition. Trump’s trade war has filled Canadians with a newfound pride and motivation to buy local to support the economy. Perhaps it’s time our grocery chains showed the same commitment to the people they serve.
