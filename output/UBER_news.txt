Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Turbo Energy S.A. TURB stock skyrocketed Tuesday after the company announced it won a $53 million contract to deliver energy storage projects in Spain with a total capacity of 366 MWh over the next two years. The deal involves more than 10 sites operated by a major construction industry client. Turbo Energy will integrate its systems fully and use its AI-based management platform to help the facilities cut power costs, improve efficiency, and expand electrification. Mariano Soria, CEO of Turbo Energy, said the agreement highlights confidence in the company's storage technology. "By entrusting us with the deployment of our C&I systems across multiple industrial facilities, this project is not only validating our competitively differentiated storage technology but also enabling substantial operational cost savings," he said.

With a range from 30 kW to 2,000 kW and storage capacity of 30 kWh to 4,000 kWh, SUNBOX Industry offers flexibility for industrial users. Its brand-agnostic design allows it to work with legacy infrastructure, easing expansion for customers facing volatile energy markets. The project advances both customer sustainability goals and Europe's decarbonization push. Turbo Energy said the expansion strengthens its role in large-scale storage and its commitment to cost-efficient clean power. Turbo Energy also revealed last week that it signed a landmark deal with Uber Technologies UBER to power the company's EV fleet in Spain. The project uses its SUNBOX Industry system to overcome grid constraints by adding flexible storage capacity, creating a 1 MW / 2 MWh smart hub capable of charging more than 300 vehicles. CEO Mariano Soria said the initiative showcases a scalable model for fleet electrification, underscoring the role of advanced storage in Europe's transportation decarbonization. ETFs such as the Invesco Solar ETF TAN and iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN also provide exposure to the renewable energy market. Price Action: TURB shares were trading higher by 535.19% to $17.15 at last check Tuesday.

Title: The consulting industry is on track to get upended, and we'll all have to deal with the consequences

Welcome back! The older you get, the tougher it can be to bounce back from the weekend. But if Sam Altman's startup gets its way, aging doesn't necessarily mean decline. BI's Hilary Brueck looked at how Retro Biosciences is developing a pill to clear out the "gunk" in your brain. In today's big story, the consulting industry is on the cusp of a big overhaul, and the rest of the business world is likely to feel it. What's on deck: Markets: Forget equity, this hedge fund just wants a cut of revenue from the tech companies it backs. Tech: It's tech news, but treat it like a spectator sport. Why people love "TBPN." Business: A Real Housewives star and former Netflix exec walks us through her daily routine. But first, the synergies are no longer synergizing. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A key pipeline for funneling talent into white-collar work has sprung a big leak that won't be easy to fix. A combination of AI, shifting customer demands, and tougher paths to promotions means the consulting industry is on the cusp of being completely reshaped, writes Business Insider's Jennifer Sor. Consultants are no strangers to volatility. In fact, a big part of their business is advising clients on the best ways to navigate change. But the current trends giving consultants plenty of work — operating more slimmed-down workforces and leveraging AI — are also impacting their own ranks. Analysts told Jennifer that the end result isn't clear, but early signs point to a tightening of senior and junior roles in the industry. BI's Polly Thompson, our resident consulting expert, has extensively reported on these trends. PwC, for example, plans to cut college graduate hiring over the next three years, with AI cited as a primary reason. That's also trickling upward as senior employees head for the exits, with several unhappy about dwindling pay and a shrinking window to reach the profession's pinnacle: partner. The rest of the business world will likely feel the effects of an upheaval within consulting. Love them or hate them, consultants are undeniably a part of the fabric of corporate America. One direct impact is the work they do with clients across the globe. Got a big business decision to make? Chances are you're going to bring in a consultant for some advice. As those firms reshape themselves, the way companies interact with, or even pay for, consultants could change. But it goes beyond that. Consulting often represents young people's foot in the white-collar workforce door. Work on a project for a few years for a client and then eventually go in-house. As the number of junior consultants dwindles, that could disrupt how countless companies stock their ranks. Those converts can also go on to do big things. Sheryl Sandberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jamie Dimon are just a few examples of high-profile consulting alums. But if anyone is well-suited to navigate a quickly moving landscape, it's consultants. After all, that's what the rest of us all pay them so much for. And if all else fails, they could always hire … a consultant. Commercial real estate is going Hollywood. You've heard of "Selling Sunset." Now get ready for "The Real Estate Commission," A&E's upcoming show about the epic highs and lows of being a commercial real estate dealmaker. Its star, Todd Drowlette, gave BI a behind-the-scenes look at the first season. A new fund wants to give tech companies the royal(ty) treatment. Althera42 wants to invest in Europe's digital infrastructure, like data centers and cloud computing, with a slight twist. Instead of getting equity, Althera42 provides capital upfront for a fixed percentage of future revenues. The idea is to bring the investing playbook behind music royalties to tech. Beware of the gigantic price bubble. David Rosenberg, founder of Rosenberg Research and a stock-market bear, warns of negative S&P 500 returns due to high valuations. The Shiller CAPE is at its third-highest level of all time. That's not the only reason Rosenberg is skeptical. Want to become fluent in tech bro? Watch "TBPN." For three hours, five days a week, hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays of the online show Technology Business Programming discuss tech industry drama like a spectator sport and chat with investors, founders, and sometimes journalists. BI's Julia Hornstein tuned in for a week to understand why it's become a must-watch for the chronically online tech crowd. Polymarket is about to cash in on a US expansion. The betting site, known for predicting Trump's presidential win in 2024, is raising another funding round that would sharply increase its valuation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Investor demand has risen as Polymarket appears ready to launch in the US. Big cuts at Musk's xAI. Elon Musk's AI startup laid off at least 500 workers from its data annotation team. xAI is now prioritzing specialist AI tutors over generalists, according to multiple messages viewed by BI's Grace Kay. How Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John does it all. At 5:30 am every morning, the former Netflix CMO is already meditating and praying. For BI's Power Hour series, Saint John shared her daily routine, from running a hair-care company and hosting a new Jimmy Fallon show to being a single mom. The world's richest men are buying huge media companies because they can. In 2022, Elon Musk bought what we used to call Twitter. That's what Larry Ellison is considering today by financing his son David's plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery weeks after buying Paramount. It's unlikely anyone will stand in the way, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Breaking up is hard to do. Especially when you're trying to break up with your employer of many years. The job market is tough enough already, but those who haven't had to job search in decades face age-related biases and other unique challenges. O, Canada: Americans, and their businesses, miss their neighbors up north. The latest challenge for Uber drivers: GPS. 'Darkest before the light': These investors think AI can lift VC out of its consumer tech slump. Meet Silicon Valley's new AI startup whisperer.

Title: Larry Ellison is back on top, 48 years after he co-founded Oracle

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

Become a Member for as little as $4/mo and enjoy unlimited reading of TSLL blog. Bursting at the seams in all the right ways. We’ve got books – fiction, cookbooks, inspired by French history, hopeful books, health books and more. Films for Anglophiles and films for family reconciliation, returning favorite television dramas with engaging leading ladies, clothes – oh my! – to continue to polish your autumn wardrobe – loafers, sweaters, totes and still there is more. Did I mention there is a must-see exhibit in London to check out? Yep, that too! Art —Marie Antoinette Style exhibit at Victoria & Albert Museum, London If you will be in London between September 20th through March 22nd of 2026, and if Marie Antoinette’s style piques your interest, be sure to put a visit to the Victoria & Albert Museum on your itinerary. The Maria Antoinette Style exhibit centers around the “complex fashion icon, Marie Antoinette’s timeless appeal, [ever so much] defined by her style, youth and notoriety. Explore the lasting influence of the most fashionable (and ill-fated) queen in history – with over 250 years of design, fashion, film and art.” Books —Beyond Blue and White: The Hidden History of Delftware and the Women Behind the Iconic Ceramic by Genevieve Wheeler Brown Delft anything. Vases, tiles, bowls, you name it, most of us can identify these beautiful pieces when we see them, but where did it all begin and how did they become iconic? And more interestingly, who are the women that were part of the history that made it so? All of this is the focus of Genevieve Wheeler Brown’s new book Beyond Blue and White. Having read a recent review in the WSJ, and being fortunate to have found a Delft vase that I now regularly use and love, I always love learning more about the history of items that catch my eye, and Delftware is one of them. In the book you will “meet female Delftware makers, including Barbara Rotteveel founder of ‘The Three Bells’ Delftware factory in 1671, be introduced to female Delftware patrons such as Queen Mary II, who found her means of expression while creating a vogue in the 17th century for Delft blue and white across royal courts. And then there are the female collectors beginning in the 19th century who saw the artistry and craft in these ceramics others had overlooked. Foremost among them was Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II who came together with fellow New York women and laid the groundwork for women in the museum world while preserving decorative arts with an educational mission.” “What begins as a curatorial exercise quickly evolves not only into an exploration of this colorful, expressive, and sometimes even humorous decorative art, coveted for hundreds of years, but also an unexpected uncovering of forceful female lives yet untold.” —Books: A Manifesto, Or, How to Build a Library by Ian Patterson Looking forward to getting my hands on this one and adding it to my library, and if you too are a fellow bibliophile, this is a book for you! Currently only available in the UK (ship to the US from Blackwells), Books: A Manifesto, or How to Build a Library is “Wise, irreverent and exhilaratingly wide-ranging” Ian Patterson “insists on reading not as a luxury but a necessary part of reality: we live within language, and when we think, it’s with the tools that reading gives us.” “Our time of cultural and political crisis demands more than books – but without them, and without the breadth of knowledge, sense of history, awareness of alternatives and hope for the future they offer, things will not get better. At once a primer for enriching your own library and a manifesto for why that matters, this book is an invitation to a deeper, richer world of thought and feeling – and a reminder of just how much books matter.” Just released yesterday on September 11th, you can find it available to ship now from Blackwells. —History Matters by David McCullough A book about and written by one of the bestselling historians of the 20th and early 21st century, History Matters, released on Tuesday the 16th, is a posthumous collection of thought-provoking essays—many never published before—[from] Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and author David McCullough affirms the value of history, how we can be guided by its lessons, and the enduring legacy of American ideals.” “Edited by McCullough’s daughter, Dorie McCullough Lawson, and his longtime researcher, Michael Hill, History Matters is a tribute to a master historian and offers fresh insights into McCullough’s enduring interests and writing life. McCullough highlights the importance of character in political leaders, with Harry Truman and George Washington serving as exemplars of American values like optimism and determination. He shares his early influences, from the books he cherished in his youth to the people who mentored him. He also pays homage to those who inspired him, such as writer Paul Horgan and painter Thomas Eakins, illustrating the diverse influences on his writing as well as the influence of art.” To be released on September 16th One of my favorite titles by McCullough was The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris —Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki Released earlier this month, and a book determined to demonstrate how the less we know and take at face value – headlines, screaming viral social media moments, you get the idea – the more we can buy the hype of hopelessness. Thankfully, Hope for Cynics argues that “we don’t have to remain stuck in this cynicism trap. Through science and storytelling, Jamil Zaki imparts the secret for beating back cynicism: hopeful skepticism—thinking critically about people and our problems, while honoring and encouraging our strengths. Far from being naïve, hopeful skepticism is a precise way of understanding others that can rebalance our view of human nature and help us build the world we truly want.” I am here for it. Thank you Zaki for writing this book. —No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce by Haley Mlotek While listening to book recommendations from the staff of NPR as they shared what they read and enjoyed this summer, Haley Mletek’s memoir sounded intriguing. No Fault: A Memoir of Romance and Divorce was inspired by the author’s own navigation through divorce and comes at this often talked about subject in a different way. Released back in February, Mlotek “combines her personal story while searching social and literary exploration [to share] a deeply felt and radiant account of 21st century divorce—the remarkably common and seemingly singular experience, and what it reveals about our society and our desires for family, love, and friendship. Mlotek asks profound questions about what divorce should be, who it is for, and why the institution of marriage maintains its power, all while charting a poignant and cathartic journey away from her own marriage towards an unknown future.” —Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body by Andrew D. Huberman, Ph.D From the podcaster behind Huberman Lab, and neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Huberman “introduces Protocols, an essential guide to improving brain function, enhancing mood and energy, optimizing bodily health and physical performance, and rewiring your nervous system to learn new skills and behaviors that can transform your life.” Being released next Tuesday, “Protocols provides simple, powerful, and evidence-based solutions to life’s most common challenges. Designed to improve your mental health, physical health, and performance, these guidelines are customizable, allowing you to adapt them to your specific needs. With his clear and engaging style, Dr. Huberman explains the scientific principles behind each protocol and how they can deliver immediate, effective results.” British Finds —Barbour x Tuckernuck collection Tuckernuck has partnered up with a favorite long-standing British brand, Barbour, to come up with a collection of quite a few good items for the autumn wardrobe. Loving the scarves, the travel umbrella, and there are a few classic quilted Barbour coats to peek at was well. Don’t forget about the sweaters and button-ups. I have shopped a few below in the scroll. —SHOP THE COLLECTION: —Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale It’s here folks. Both absolutely beyond eager to watch, and yet, reticent as well. Reviewers are in agreement that the finale will please fans – read NYTimes review here, Daily Beast and AP, with The Guardian is skeptical this film will really be the true finale of the Crawleys. And at some point this weekend, I will be watching it in the theater where it deserves to be watched. If you too will be joining the throng of crowds, I hope you enjoy the two hours of this captivating family’s story we’ve been watching since September 2010. Watch an official clip from the film about why Lady Mary’s divorce occurred that begins the film. Cookbooks —Abundance: Stories and Recipes from a Gardening Cook by Mark Diacono Only available in the UK (but you can have it shipped to the US from Blackwells), Abundance: Eating And Living with the Seasons from cook and gardener Mark Diacono looks delicious both in its approach and in its ideas. “With his days distracted by the ping of communication and the tug of commitments, Mark Diacono wondered how he might better savour this one precious life. He started to write and photograph each week, hoping that this simple commitment might sharpen his appreciation of the magic in the everyday and his time spent in the kitchen. It reminds us that abundance comes in many forms – the passing of the seasons, our connection to the world around us, and the wealth that a garden, a town and its surrounding landscapes offers. “With over 80 recipes like Early summer shakshuka, Salsify and radicchio gratin, Onion seed and oregano flower focaccia, Fig leaf and olive oil ice cream, and a Mulberry martini, there are dishes to inspire and satisfy every week as the year unfolds before you.” —Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share with People You Love by Samin Nosrat Long awaited from international bestselling cookbook author and star of the Netflix series inspired by the book, Samin Nosrat’s new book Good Things will be released on Tuesday. Described as ” an essential, joyful guide to cooking and living, whether you’re looking for a comforting tomato soup to console a struggling friend, seeking a deeper sense of connection in your life, or hosting a dinner for ten in your too-small dining room. Here you’ll find go-to recipes for ricotta custard pancakes, a showstopping roast chicken burnished with saffron, a crunchy, tingly Calabrian chili crisp, super-chewy sky-high focaccia, and a decades-in-the-making, childhood-evoking yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Along the way, you’ll also find plenty of tips, techniques, and lessons, from how to buy olive oil (check the harvest date) to when to splurge (salad dressing is where you want to use your best ingredients) to the best uses for your pressure cooker (chicken stock and dulce de leche, naturally).” “Enjoy 125 meticulously tested, flavor-forward, soul-nourishing recipes that bring joy and a sense of communion.” Film —Looking Through Water Almost immediately, this new film, starring Michael Douglas and his son, reminded me of On Golden Pond where another real-life parent and child take to the screen to tell a familiar story of healing. Looking Through Water will premiere this weekend in select theaters and tells the story of a father’s attempt to reconnect with his estranged son, doing so by inviting him to compete in a father-son fishing competition.” Have a look at the trailer below. Francophile Finds —French Country Crocks New to the shop at Farm House Pottery from Farmhouse Pottery fromVivi et Margot are French Country Crocks drawing inspiration from “the charm of the French countryside blended with Vermont’s artisanal spirit. These handmade crocks, available in two distinct stoneware finishes, reflect the calming hues of nature and the timeless art of wheel-thrown pottery. Perfect for any kitchen looking to add a touch of rustic beauty, each crock is designed to be a treasured piece in your home, blending form and function for generations to come.” —Van Gogh’s Lover: A Novel by Michael Hetzer I want to first begin by thanking TSLL long-time reader and member Christine for recommending this book to our community. Knowing that art and of course France are frequent subjects of interest, this title is definitely one I think many will enjoy. Released eaerlier this year, Van Gogh’s Lover is inspired by the true story of Vincent Van Gogh’s years in France. The plot begins twelve years after “a high school accident derailed Jane’s once-promising future. When the owners of the powerful Firth Gallery invite Jane to bring her beloved family painting, The Lover, to Switzerland, it looks like a second chance. But on her first night in Geneva, the painting goes missing, and she suspects the Firths.” “Determined to recover her painting, Jane is led to a dying village in the high Alps where an enigmatic man living in a château is waiting for her. Within the château’s walls, she uncovers a history of lies, murder, and, at its heart, an appalling injustice that will shake the art world to its core.” “But not everyone wants these facts brought to light. Jane will need to find the strength she lost in her accident and face the shocking truth about her past, her painting, and, finally, an epic love affair between a destitute painter named Vincent Van Gogh and a mysterious woman who inspired a portrait that may be his greatest work.” Shopping —Banana Republic’s Friends & Family Event, 40% off full priced purchase Beginning today (12th) and running through the 21st, enjoy 40% off any full priced purchase.

The subtle slouch totes are quite popular at the moment, and so long as they provide the structure and the storage paired with comfort to swing over your shoulder, I will take note. RSVP Paris’ parachute appears to check all the boxes. —Varley’s Enrico Knit Jacket, three colors available Autumn is for all intents and purposes, has technically arrived here in Bend, and this knit jacket with flattering collar (and thus warmth when needed but only when needed) with its zipped front looks to be a go-to item to elevate a casual outfit. —Varley’s Tomlinson Belted Long Coat This coat has been getting a lot of buzz as of late, and for good reason. For fewer than $500, a timeless houndstooth (puppytooth, technically) long coat. Not a bad price if it fits your silhouette, and I think it just might fit even thos of us who are tall! Made with double-faced, unlined Melton fabric, it would be a wonderful autumn coat as we transition from cool to colder temps. —Vince scarves, various fabrics Light cotton gauze or sheer wool fabric, the simple color choices to flatter your skin tone, choose a solid or a stripe, and this accessory will be with you for years.

And on Sunday at 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern), the 77th annual show takes place. Cue the premieres of just about every returning and new show to begin in the days and weeks to come. —High Potential, season 2 (US version) ABC/Hulu Speaking of which, the mystery series adapted from the original French series HPI (Haut Potentiel Intellectuel) – which by the way you can watch on Hulu as well!, is returning for a second season. High Potential premieres Tuesday September 16th on ABC/Hulu. Having watched a the latest season (4th) of the French version (there are five seasons so far – the fifth is being developed right now), I am curious to know if the American version will follow the same storyline for its main characters. We will see! We will see! Have a look at the trailer below. —The Morning Show, season 4 – AppleTV+ And after two years, The Morning Show is back! And boy, does it look to be high drama scene after scene! Whoa!

Wednesday evenings are booked! Have a look at the trailer below and enjoy 10 episodes, taking us all the way to middle of November. The rain came, continued to fall, gushed, created temporary ponds in the roads and roundabouts, then Mother Nature gave us a day of sunshine before cuing the rain’s return. As many will have guessed, the happy dances at Le Papillon were in full swing! So happy am I that we are now tuckered as Nelle demonstrates above. But tuckered in a very good way ☺️. With the weather as it was, the encouragement to stay inside after our walks, meant quite a bit of work occurred on the fourth book, and as I put in the last few sections that after two months away from the book this summer, I realized the book would absolutely do well to have, we’re getting close to done. And that feels amazing. 😌 Last weekend a new family member for the garden was planted, a tree I thought I would have to wait until spring to plant, but it sort of plopped into my lap and I couldn’t say no. I will be sure to share exactly what and where it is in the Garden post later this month, and TOP Tier members can look for the monthly Ponderings . . . post to be shared this weekend. We will be talking about all sorts of stuff including the beginning steps on the Guest Bedroom project. Now that the peaches have been made into jam after sharing the rest with the neighbors, weekends shift away from garden projects (although soon, soon! the cottage gate will be installed!) and into home and life projects which coordinates well with the seasonal shift. Wearing my first scarf on a walk this week, the Outfits of the Month post is full of five outfits taking inspiration from the British while we bring on the layers for fall. And on Monday, Part Trois (3) of What Lies at the Heart of Living Simply Luxuriously was shared as we talked about savoring the everyday ‘sides’ of living well. And before I sign off and send you exploring the links below, check out this photo by enrollee of TSLL’s Intro to French Cooking class.
