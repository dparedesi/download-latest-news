In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer — and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a "big cost," adding, "If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company." It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest — Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a "semi-retirement" mode. "A lot of them have families," one Nvidia employee said, "and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. "Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years," said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, "Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement." In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a "lottery winner syndrome," meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. "The golden handcuffs are RSUs," the former Broadcom employee said. "No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities." Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that "RSUs promote retention" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is "below the technology industry benchmark." It cited equity awards as a "powerful long-term retention incentive," saying it has "historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees." The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time — and whose shares are worth exponentially more — "are just resting and vesting." The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to "front-load" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses — and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. "In private conversations I've had with others," another former Broadcom employee said, "they're quite pleased with RSUs." Jump to

Title: New Trump Administration Energy Rule Would Enable Data Centers with ‘Large Loads’

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Data centers are being built with unprecedented gusto all over the U.S. The reason for this is fairly well known: the AI business requires gargantuan amounts of electricity and computing power. Every time you use an app like DALL-E to, say, make one of those dumb AI-generated images of Mickey Mouse committing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, you’re apparently using as much energy as it takes to charge an iPhone. Now picture how much electricity is being used if millions of Americans do it at the same time. The Trump administration has made it known that it’s a friend to the AI industry (it recently launched the AI infrastructure initiative Stargate) and so, it makes perfect sense that its Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, has decided to cut the red tape when it comes to hooking data centers up to the electrical grid. In a statement published Friday, the Energy Department announced its plan to amend current rules to allow organizations that consume a lot of electricity to connect to the grid much faster: “U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today to initiate rulemaking procedures with a proposed rule to rapidly accelerate the interconnection of large loads, including data centers, positioning the United States to lead in AI innovation and in the revitalization of domestic manufacturing.” Hear that, guys? Chris Wright is apparently such a big fan of large loads that, in a bout of deregulatory fervor, he’s now helping to usher in a new era of easier data center connection. While the specifics of Wright’s proposed rule are a little bit complicated, the obvious takeaway seems to be an effort to make the regulatory process less onerous on people who want to hook up a lot of servers to the grid. The Register notes that one proposed rule is to “limit the time taken to review connection decisions to 60 days,” ostensibly so applicants don’t get bogged down in a lengthy review process. In a letter about the proposed rule change published to the government’s website, Wright wrote: “To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity. To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner. This is an urgent issue that requires prompt attention.” He added: “This Administration is committed to revitalizing domestic manufacturing/ and driving American AI innovation.’ both of which will require unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity and substantial investment in the Nation’s interstate transmission system. We must do so efficiently, fairly, and expeditiously.” The data center industry is booming, and, despite all that “bubble” talk when it comes to the AI business, it shows no signs of slowing down. Companies like Nebiusâwhich most of us had never heard of twelve months agoâare in the process of making themselves essential to large parts of the digital economy. Nebius, which is an AI infrastructure provider (it operates data centers), recently netted a deal with Microsoft, and went in on a robotaxi firm with Uber. Its stock price has also erupted some 350 percent this year, so, suffice to sayâfor the momentâit really pays to have a lot of servers.

Title: Insiders Are Scooping Up Shares of a Miner, a Driller, and a Biotech

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 While insider buying is typically slower when markets are near all-time highs and when earnings-reporting season is in full swing, it never seems to dry up altogether. A few notable purchases in the past week or so attest to this. A beneficial owner took advantage of a public offer to increase a stake in a gold and silver miner, while another showed some love for a struggling offshore driller. The chief executives of a biotech also continued acquiring shares. Let’s take a quick look at these notable transactions in the past week or so. What does insider buying tell us? A well-known adage reminds us that corporate insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company because they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Thus, insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. This is all the more so during times of uncertainty in the markets, and even when markets are near all-time highs. With the third-quarter earnings-reporting season underway, many insiders are prohibited from buying or selling shares. Below are some of the most notable insider purchases that were reported recently, starting with the largest and most prominent. This transaction was part of a public offering of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: HYMC) stock that raised approximately $150 million. The Nevada-based miner subsequently announced that it had extinguished all its remaining debt. The stock is almost 88% higher than 90 days ago and was last seen trading almost a dollar per share higher than the buyer’s purchase price. The share price is up 167.6% year over year. The stock has little analyst coverage and no Buy ratings. Yet, the consensus price target is up at $13.61. Note that this Canadian billionaire previously purchased $62 million worth of the shares this summer. Sable Offshore Corp. (NYSE: SOC) stock recently sank to a 52-week low below $12 as the Houston-based company faces multiple legal and regulatory issues. Shares were last seen trading well below the purchase price range above. The offshore oil and gas field operations provider has a mean price target of $39.20, which would be a gain of 207.9% in the next 12 months. All five analysts who cover the stock recommend buying shares. Roth Capital recently reiterated its Buy rating. Note that this buyer’s stake is up to more than 10.9 million shares. Also note that about 24% of all shares are held short. These transactions were part of a private placement. Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) posted a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and the stock has retreated 8.1% in the past week. The Miami-based biopharmaceutical company also recently announced the expansion of Phase 3 trials of its colorectal cancer treatment. Despite recent declines, the stock is still up 8.2% year to date and trading for more than the purchase price above. The $31.80 mean price target is less than the $36.91 52-week high, but that target represents a gain of 60.0% in the coming year. Analysts on average recommend buying shares. Co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh also purchased shares last month. catnap72 / Getty Images These were not the only notable insider purchases of the past week or so. Here’s a quick look at some others. Recently, some smaller insider buying was reported at Commercial Metals, Denny’s, Fastenal, Fifth Third Bancorp, Heico, Synovus Financial, Toll Brothers, and Uber, as well.
