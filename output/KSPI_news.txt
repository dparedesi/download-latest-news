(NYSE: WGO) On September 23, 2024, Hunterbrook Media published an article called "‘Grand Deception"- Winnebago Muzzles Outcry Over Major Problem That Owners Say Makes RVs Dangerous, Untowable, Worthless." The article stated that Winnebago's "best-selling Grand Design RVs" appear to be "experiencing frame failure, potentially affecting thousands of units sold for more than a billion dollars.

(NYSE: V) On September 24, 2024, during market hours, The United States Department of Justice issued a release entitled “Justice Department Sues Visa for Monopolizing Debit Markets.” In this release, the DOJ announced that it had “filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today against Visa for monopolization and other unlawful conduct in debit network markets[.]” The release further stated that the “complaint alleges that Visa illegally maintains a monopoly over debit network markets by using its dominance to thwart the growth of its existing competitors and prevent others from developing new and innovative alternatives.” The release quoted Attorney General Merrick Garland as stating that “[w]e allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market[.] Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing – but the price of nearly everything.” On this news, the price of Visa stock fell 5.4% on September 24, 2024.
