Go figure. During the most intense shopping season of the year, the “Shop” pillar of the Connected Economy 100 went down 3.7% last week. It led the index down by 2.8%, as all the pillars dropped at about the same rate as the general markets. Within that Shop pillar, Shopify’s 5% stock price decrease stood out. A sweep of the week’s news finds that it might have taken a hit from some negative publicity surrounding its checkout policies. Shopify has barred merchants from automatically adding charges like insurance premiums to shoppers’ orders. According to a recent article in The Information an increasing number of merchants now offer delivery insurance, covering theft or damages to packages and often add the charges to orders. According to the article, “Such a trend threatens to upset Shopify’s shoppers, making them less likely to trust its Shop Pay checkout and to hurt its ability to sell its branded checkout to bigger merchants who don’t use its other services. That could hurt Shopify’s growth, which has surged this year — the company reported that revenue grew 23% in the first nine months of the year to $6 billion. That fueled a 41% increase in its stock price, lifting Shopify’s market capitalization to $142 billion. In the “Bank” pillar, a 3.4% drop was accelerated by a 7.5 drop at Ally Bank. According to Marketbeat, analysts have weighed in with mixed reviews on Ally Financial, with several adjusting their price targets amid shifting market conditions. Bank of America revised its price objective downward, from $46 to $37, while maintaining a “buy” rating in a Sept. 11 report. Royal Bank of Canada reaffirmed its “outperform” rating and set a $40 target price in an Oct. 21 note. TD Cowen followed suit on Sept. 23, lowering its price target from $45 to $37 and shifting to a “hold” stance. BTIG Research downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral” on Sept. 16. Wells Fargo took a more bearish view, cutting its target price from $37 to $32 and assigning an “underweight” rating on Sept. 26. Of the analysts covering Ally Financial, one rates the stock a “sell,” nine suggest “hold,” and eight recommend “buy,” according to MarketBeat.com. The consensus rating stands at “hold,” with an average price target of $42.14. The “Live” pillar was also down 3.4%, led by a big 15.1% plunge at iRobot. The company, manufacturer of the Roomba vacuum and other in-home robotics, is in turnaround mode featuring a series of executive changes, and said so during its recent Q3 earnings call. “We continue to make progress on our turnaround strategy,” said Gary Cohen, iRobot’s CEO. “In the third quarter, we expanded our non-GAAP gross margin by 590 basis points year over year and improved our use of operating cash. However, our overall results did not meet the expectations we set in August, as persistent market segment and competitive headwinds impacted our sell-through performance. “Although we now expect it will take more time to stabilize our revenue trend, we are on track to exceed our operating expense targets for the year, while at the same time continuing to invest in areas that are expected to drive growth.” The “Move” pillar dropped 3.4% as well. It was led downward by a 13% drop at freight transport provider XPO. Some analysts see a potential hit coming from the Trump administration’s threatened tariffs. But most analysts are bullish on the stock. Marketbeat said, “Freight transporters like XPO Inc. NYSE: XPO and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. NASDAQ: ODFL provide less-than-truckload (LTL) service domestically and internationally, making them a critical part of the process of connecting manufacturers with end customers. Of these firms, XPO stands out for its strong performance in the last year (shares of XPO are up 57% for the year as of Dec. 20, while ODFL has declined by more than 9% over the same period).” Finally, the “Be Well” pillar took a 3.3% hit led by continued troubles at Aetna CVS, down 10%. Last week, it announced that it had expanded its health app’s functionality to include Spanish language support, aiming to enhance accessibility for its diverse member base. Spanish-speaking users can access features such as personalized health information, medication reminders, and telemedicine services in their preferred language.

Let's take a closer look at each of these fast-growing companies. Data comes from company reports and Stockanalysis.com. Eli Lilly is a drugmaker offering treatments for diabetes, weight loss, plaque psoriasis, anxiety, fibromyalgia and other conditions. Eli Lilly has business momentum, thanks to Mounjaro and Zepbound, two formulations that treat diabetes and obesity, respectively. Both drugs are versions of the compound tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 drugs have been popular since competing product Ozempic became the weight-loss answer for Hollywood A-listers. Ozempic is technically a diabetes medication, but its maker Novo Nordisk markets a related product called Wegovy for weight loss. Demand for Ozempic, Wegovy and the Eli Lilly treatments have outpaced supply, causing shortages in the U.S. Lilly is addressing the shortage by investing billions in production capacity. The company has also completed clinical trials showing its Zepbound treatment is more effective for weight loss than Wegovy. Since 2020, LLY's EPS has varied from $5.80 to $6.90. Analysts expect 2024 and 2025 EPS of $13.32 and $22.24, respectively. ServiceNow offers a workflow automation platform for enterprise technology management. The platform is sold on a subscription basis to Fortune 500 companies and others. In the third quarter of 2024, ServiceNow had subscription growth of 22.5%—beating the high end of the company's guidance. Customers are responding well to ServiceNow's AI-focused messaging. The company is positioning its Now platform as an essential AI-powered resource for digital transformation. The company's investments in efficiency-enhancing generative AI features are also paying off. Examples include industry-targeted AI solutions for financial services, telecommunications and more. ServiceNow is also incorporating agenic AI into its platform. Agenic AI is an emerging AI innovation that can complete complex tasks, learn and make decisions without human intervention. Analysts expect NOW to produce 2024 and 2025 EPS of $14.06 and $16.87, respectively. The company delivered $8.42 in EPS in 2023 and $1.60 in 2022. Shopify manages and sells a commerce platform that customers use to manage inventory and sell products online and offline. Shopify generates about $8 billion in annual revenue with a leading 28% market share in the e-commerce platform segment. Like ServiceNow, Shopify invests continually in platform features to enhance efficiency and productivity for customers. In Shopify's case, the customers range from solo entrepreneurs to big brands. Recent enhancements include the launch of generative AI to respond to customer queries and the expansion of sales tax management to the entire EU. The company has a great growth track record, expanding sales from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $7 billion last year. Analysts expect EPS of $1.29 in 2024 and $1.54 in 2025, both sizable upticks from the $0.10 earned in 2023.

MercadoLibre manages the top e-commerce marketplace and one of the largest online payment platforms in Latin America. MELI is often called the "Amazon of South America." Both companies operate dominant e-commerce marketplaces in their regions and have delivered strong returns to shareholders for a decade. MercadoLibre does not have a cloud computing business like Amazon, but it does have a popular digital payment solution, Mercado Pago. Between 2019 and 2023, MercadoLibre grew annual revenues from $2.2 billion to more than $14.4 billion. The bottom line increased from a $3.71 loss per share to earnings of $19.47 per share, with steady operating margin growth along the way. Analysts expect the growth pattern to continue. Strengthening economic conditions in Argentina is one reason for optimism. MercadoLibre has a strong position there in e-commerce and payments, with no formidable competitors. The 2024 and 2025 EPS predictions for MELI are $36.10 and $47.92, respectively. Monolithic Power Systems designs and sells power circuits that control voltage to servers, AI and storage applications, vehicle components, home appliances, communications infrastructure and more. Monolithic has revenue exposure to three transforming industries: automotive, AI and 5G. This positioning helped the company raise its stock price from about $384 in 2021 to a high of $940 last October. However, the MPWR stock price has since dipped to the $590s. The prompt was a report speculating that Nvidia canceled its backlogged orders of a Monolithic product due to performance issues. Monolithic denied the speculations, but investors have not been convinced. The pullback may create an opportunity to buy this growing company. A Citi analyst thinks so. Analyst Kelsey Chia initiated coverage on MPWR with a buy rating and a price target of $700. Chia cited strength in AI and automotive, arguing that the opportunity available will outweigh any market share loss for Monolithic with Nvidia. Analysts expect MPWR to produce 2024 EPS of $14.35, up from $8.76 in the prior year. The 2025 EPS outlook is $16.89. Shift4 Payments provides integrated payment processing solutions to merchants in the U.S. and internationally. Shift4 Payments has steadily grown sales from $731 million in 2019 to more than $3 billion in the 12 months before September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company produced record cash flow, signed new hospitality and gaming customers, expanded geographically and raised its full-year sales and Ebitda outlooks. With strong sales, a $33 billion backlog and three acquisitions to integrate, Shift4 Payments has momentum. Acquisitions of POS companies Revel and Vectron expand the company's network of merchant customers, driving revenue and creating cross-sell opportunities. Those are a few reasons why analysts believe FOUR will produce EPS of $3.75 in 2024 and $4.71 in 2025—marking significant earnings improvement from $1.42 in 2023. Corcept Therapeutics develops treatments for metabolic, psychiatric and oncologic disorders. The company has one marketed product, a cortisol receptor blocker called Korlym. Corcept's pipeline includes Phase III and Phase IV treatments for Cushing's Syndrome and a Phase III treatment for ovarian cancer, among other things. Korlym has produced steadily growing revenue since 2019—including 48% revenue growth and 46% diluted net income per share growth in the third quarter of 2024. Conditions look good for the growth to continue. The company recently announced positive results from the treatment phase of its Catalyst study: Korlym reached its primary endpoint in patients with Cushing's Syndrome and hard-to-control type 2 diabetes. An earlier phase of Catalyst showed Cushing's is more common than previously thought. Corcept has also seen positive clinical trial results from a Phase III study of relacorilant, another treatment for Cushing's Syndrome. The EPS expectation for Corcept in 2024 is $1.39, which compares favorably to 2023 EPS of $0.94. For 2025, analysts believe the company will produce EPS of $1.79.
