Table of contents Email marketing automation is the best way to win all the benefits of personalized campaigns without incurring the expenses of running these campaigns manually at scale. Check this out. Forrester conducted a Total Economic Impact study on GetResponse Max customers. GetResponse Max provides an automation platform that allows businesses to conduct advanced audience segmentation for personalized marketing campaigns. The report showed users of the automation platform saw a return on investment of 305% and net present value of $302,000. Campaign assembly effort was also reduced by 73% while the payback period was just under 3 months. That’s the potential impact of deploying an effective email marketing automation strategy for your eCommerce business. But what does an effective automation strategy look like? This article will share the vital ecommerce email marketing automations every online store needs. We’ll also provide a roundup of the best automation platforms you can use for the job. Discover how email marketing automation can increase ROI and reduce campaign effort by 73%. Learn the essential workflows every online store needs to increase sales and customer lifetime value. Email marketing automation is the process of creating triggers and conditions that ensure your pre-set emails are sent to specific customers when the triggers are activated and the necessary conditions are met. For example, you can set a trigger for an email with a welcome discount to be sent to a user who signs up for your newsletter for the first time. This email will be deployed automatically every time a new email enters your email list. Ecommerce email marketing automation is powered by automation platforms. These automations deliver several benefits, including: The average email marketing ROI is $36 for every $1 spent. As you can imagine, this ROI can drop or go higher depending on your strategy. Email automation optimizes your ROI. This is achieved in various ways. One, automation allows you to deliver the most important messages when it matters most. This is critical because timing can be the difference between a user choosing to take advantage of their welcome discount or not. An effective strategy ensures that the welcome discount is delivered at the right time, when the potential customer is most engaged. Perfect timing is achieved with all email automation workflows, not just welcome discounts. Email marketing automation also optimizes your ROI by reducing the effort you put into campaigns. As the Forrester study above pointed out, users of the GetResponse Max automation platform saw their campaign assembly efforts drop by 73%. This means less time and salaries invested in running email campaigns. You can also expect a high ROI for your email marketing efforts because campaigns will be personalized to resonate with each recipient. Automation platforms can track the product pages users interact with and use that data to send personalized product recommendations, for example. They can also track a user’s purchase history and use the data to cross-sell and upsell relevant products. Email automation eliminates repetitive tasks like segmenting audiences, sending follow-ups, optimizing send times, inserting dynamic content, and even monitoring deliverability. These are incredibly vital marketing tasks, but they’re extremely time-consuming to do manually. Automation allows you to set the segmentation rules, and these will be executed on autopilot until the day you decide to change the rules. It also helps with monitoring when each user opens emails and uses that data to optimize send time. The best automation platforms also support the insertion of dynamic content. This essentially means that email items like the product recommendations can be changed automatically to align with the preferences or interests of each recipient. Basically, automation frees up your time, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks like brainstorming new campaign ideas, coming up with fresh creatives, and ideating A/B tests. Effective email automation makes your customers feel seen and valued. It also eliminates friction by ensuring that critical communications like order confirmation, as well as shipping and delivery alerts, are delivered on time. Automation supports personalization, which means your customers will only receive messages they’re interested in. This makes customers feel they’re having a one-to-one interaction with your brand. Not only does it boost customer satisfaction and conversion rates, but it can also increase repeat purchases, which boosts your customer lifetime value. Speaking of which…. Ecommerce automation boosts customer lifetime value and average order value through several strategic automations. Consider an automation workflow like customer re-engagement. This workflow targets past customers who have been inactive for an extended period. It brings them back to your store where they can rediscover products they loved and explore new items. Automated upselling and cross-selling email campaigns are also critical for boosting the average order value. Some brands even include these upsells and cross-sells within automated emails, like transactional emails. Here are nine critical automated email campaigns you must create for your online store. A welcome email is deployed when a new user submits their email address to join your subscriber list. This workflow can be customized to have either a one-off email or a series of emails. Welcome emails see extremely high engagement rates. According to the 2024 email marketing benchmarks, these campaigns had an open rate of 83.63% and a click-through rate of 16.60%. For context, the average email open rate is 39.64% That’s why you must automate welcome emails to ensure they’re delivered when your customers are most engaged and expecting them. You can further enhance the effectiveness of these campaigns by adding a time-limited welcome discount. This encourages the user to become a paid customer immediately. Here is what a simple welcome automation workflow looks like. The following template uses a split logic to send different types of welcome emails. A welcome email is your opportunity to introduce your brand, explain what makes you unique, and set expectations with new subscribers. You can also share key links, such as links to your best-selling products and customer support page. Check out this welcome email example from Local Revival. The email includes a decent welcome discount, a brief explanation of what makes the brand unique, and links to best sellers. Abandoned cart recovery emails are sent to customers who add items to the cart but leave your site before completing their purchase. Cart abandonment is a big problem for eCommerce stores. Data shows that up to 70% of online carts are abandoned. An effective cart abandonment email workflow can help you recover a good portion of these sales. For example, iParts, an online store selling auto parts, used the GetResponse Max automation platform to address the cart abandonment issue. The brand deployed one cart abandonment email campaign, which saw an open rate of 30%. More importantly, 20% of the recipients made a purchase. Like a welcome email, cart abandonment email campaigns can be either a single email or a series of emails. A series of cart abandonment emails can produce better results because it allows you to follow up with prospects. Top automation platforms also let you create automation splits where you can target different cart abandoners with different messages to optimize conversions. For example, you can create a split based on the cart value. For instance, users whose cart value is above $150 can receive a cart abandonment email offering an incentive like free shipping or a discount. Here’s an example of a cart abandonment workflow template. An effective cart abandonment email includes an image of the product and a link going directly to the cart. This reduces friction and makes it easier for buyers to complete their orders. You can also include social proof like customer testimonials and product reviews to build trust and help hesitant shoppers feel confident checking out. Finally, compelling discounts can often work the magic to make hesitant customers feel that the deal is too good to pass up. Take a look at this abandoned cart email example by Casper. Casper stays on brand with the comical header that’s bound to grab attention. They’ve also included social proof through a customer testimonial. Which email automation workflow has been most effective for your ecommerce business – welcome series, cart abandonment, or customer reengagement? Customers can lose touch with your business for different reasons. Maybe they made an impulse purchase when they ran into your paid ads on social media and never thought about your brand again. It’s also possible that they got lured away by a competitor’s offer, and they’ve never visited your store again. Whatever the case may be, customer reengagement campaigns are good at reigniting the interest of inactive customers. Automation platforms offer workflow templates to target customers who have not made a purchase from your store within the last 60 days. You can also customize the template to include a custom number of days. Here’s what a winback automation template looks like. Use personalization to make your customer win-back email campaigns more compelling. You can reference the last thing the customer ordered. Tell them how your store now has the same item in different colors, for example. You can also mention related products, what’s new about your brand, and include a welcome-back discount. Here’s one of our favorite customer winback emails to inspire you. Transactional emails are sent in response to specific customer actions on your website. For example, the email can be deployed when a customer creates an account in your store. These emails are extremely important because they confirm critical actions and build trust with the customers. Transactional emails can also be considered as post-purchase emails since most of them are sent after a customer has placed their order. Here are some examples of these emails. You will need different workflows for each of these emails. Automation software integrates with your eCommerce platform to track when a customer makes a purchase to complete their order. This action triggers the order confirmation email. Once your systems show that the order has been fulfilled, the email platform deploys the order delivery confirmation email. Take a look at this example of a GDPR-compliant confirmation email workflow. Customers who have consented to receive marketing emails can get an order confirmation email with upsells and cross-sells using this workflow. Meanwhile, those who have shared their consent will only get a standard confirmation email. Check out this order confirmation email. Crate & Barrel confirms the order briefly and then takes advantage of the high engagement rates of confirmation emails to cross-sell other products. Sometimes, prospective customers arrive at your store and discover the products they were interested in are out of stock. One way to make sure that you don’t lose these prospects forever is to ask them to submit their email address, so you can notify them when the items are back in stock. Therefore, back-in-stock email notifications are sent to customers when the items they showed interest in have been restocked. These emails can help you recover some of the lost sales. Effective back-in-stock emails can have high conversion rates since you’re targeting leads that have already shown interest and buying intent. Here’s an example of a back-in-stock email. Product replenishment reminders are one of the most effective ways to increase repeat customers and boost the customer lifetime value. These emails are designed to be sent after a specific duration to remind customers that they need to restock their consumable goods. Skincare products, vitamins, supplements, shaving razors, baby diapers, and pet foods are all examples of consumable products that could be the subject of product replenishment reminders. Timing and cadence are critical for the success of these automated email campaigns. You don’t want to send the reminders too soon, and you also don’t want to wait too long. Analyze your customer purchase data to determine the average time it takes for your customers to reorder their supplies. You’ll also need to use dynamic triggers here. Some customers may buy supplies to last them a week. Others shop on a monthly basis. That means a one-size-fits-all automation workflow won’t work. You’ll need to track the purchase behavior and history of each customer to determine when each reminder should be deployed. Personalization is essential for the success of these campaigns. Reference the customer’s past orders in your email subject line and body. Use a one-click reorder CTA that automatically adds all the items. This saves the customer time, meaning they won’t need to look for and add the items to the cart from scratch. Here’s an example of a replenishment reminder. You can also offer incentives, such as loyalty bonuses, to customers who choose to reorder their items. Product replenishment reminders also present opportunities for upselling. You can upsell the customer to an auto-ship program, for example. This generates predictable cash flow for you while keeping your customers engaged. It can also boost revenue by encouraging repeat purchases. Plus, it ensures your loyal customers never run out of their favorite essentials. Create sophisticated email automation workflows that drive sales and increase customer lifetime value. Our drag-and-drop editor and pre-built templates make it easy to set up professional campaigns in minutes. Browse abandonment emails target customers who went through one or several product pages in your online store but left without making a purchase. These automated emails work just like cart abandonment emails but with a different trigger. The condition used for these workflows is “visited page,” as shown below. You must also create a filter to exclude folks who may have visited and exited that page but bought something else from another page. These automated emails would typically share images of the products that potential customers had viewed and might include incentives such as discounts and free shipping to encourage conversions. The best browse abandonment emails also highlight related products. This section can help bring customers back to your site in case they didn’t make a purchase because they didn’t like the products they were viewing. It informs the customer of other options they might find more appealing. It can be items in different styles or the same item they looked at, but in a different color or price point. The email copy does a great job creating a sense of urgency and FOMO. Celebrating your customers with heartwarming messages and exclusive discounts during their key milestones is an effective way to strengthen customer relationships and build loyalty. Birthday and anniversary emails do precisely that by tracking your customer’s key dates and sending celebratory messages. Here’s the workflow for these emails. Anniversary and birthday emails can include exclusive discounts to help your customers celebrate their special day in style. You can also use dynamic content to highlight the customer’s favorite products based on their purchase history. The email has a playful tone and includes a bold CTA going directly to the featured product in the hero section. You can automate customer feedback collection in various ways. One is to include the feedback collection link in a transactional email. You can add the link in the order delivery email, for example. Another way to collect customer feedback is by creating a dedicated email workflow for feedback requests. The best part about this workflow is that you can use a time delay to ensure the email is sent a few days after the customer has received their order. This allows them to provide objective product reviews and overall customer experience feedback based on their experience using the product and buying from your store. Customer feedback, like product reviews, gives you social proof you can use to promote your products. The feedback also helps you improve the customer experience by highlighting friction points you need to address. Therefore, you do want to create a compelling copy that encourages customers to share their feedback. J.Crew sends a separate feedback request email to collect product reviews from its customers. The email is straightforward and makes the process painless for customers by including links to where customers can leave a review for each product.

Title: Elon Musk is going founder mode on Tesla's $16.5 billion chip deal with Samsung

Time Published: 2025-07-28T17:26:29Z
Full Content:
Two particular lines in Elon Musk's posts about Tesla's new chip deal highlight just how far his "founder mode" approach extends. In this case, right down to his stated terms of Tesla's manufacturing agreement with Samsung. In a $16.5 billion deal, Samsung will produce Tesla's new AI6 chip from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026. Located outside of Austin, Samsung's plant is close to where Musk moved in 2020, and where his company Tesla later moved in 2021. In an X post, Musk wrote that he would personally monitor the plant's activity. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress," Musk wrote. "And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house." In other words — "founder mode." Musk also wrote that Samsung "agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency." The Tesla CEO wrote that the deal, which Bloomberg first reported, was one of "strategic importance" for the automaker. Neither Tesla nor Samsung responded to a request for comment. Musk has long been known for taking a founder-mode approach to running his companies, an in-the-details entrepreneurial mindset that has flourished in Silicon Valley. He famously slept on the factory floor during Tesla's Model 3. He personally renamed and reorganized an entire company when taking over Twitter, now X, and he set up shop in D.C. during his DOGE era. The term "founder mode" itself, though, is newer. Its origins stem from a 2024 talk that Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky gave for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. In it, he advised against the common principle that leaders of large-scale companies should hire good employees and give them space to do their job. In a September essay titled "Founder Mode," YC cofounder Paul Graham reflected on Chesky's talk, writing that there are "things founders can do that managers can't." Graham coined the term "founder mode," describing leaders of big companies who work on the ground across the company, delving into the details at a granular level, and not just via their direct reports. Chesky later embraced the mantra named after his talk, along with much of Silicon Valley. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote on X that "we need founder mode companies in all industries." In his essay, Graham thanked a variety of tech leaders for reading early drafts, including YC CEO Garry Tan, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Musk himself. While the terms Musk describes for Tesla's manufacturing deal and his plans to personally walk the Samsung assembly line are very "founder mode," he's not the only CEO keeping a close eye on a company's supply chain. Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple before becoming CEO by closely managing Apple's supply chain. The iPhone giant famously keeps a very close eye on its manufacturing partners, many of which are in China. A United airport sign photographed in 2019 and confirmed to be legitimate by the airline revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats a day for its employees to travel from San Francisco to Shanghai, a travel hub connecting to Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, which have been called "iPhone cities." The iPhone maker is also known for having a broad team of operations overseers. Samsung's new chip deal with Tesla marks a major win for its foundry business. As of 1 p.m. in New York, the company's stock price was up 6.8%. And while Tesla's assembly line workers have experienced Elon Musk's founder mode approach, it sounds like soon Samsung's will too.
