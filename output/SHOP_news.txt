Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The new format, called Diamond & Pearls, officially launches May 29 in Delray Beach, Fla. Senior Editor, Retail David’s Bridal Inc., seeking to lift its image and widen its appeal to a higher-income audience, has launched a new retail format called Diamonds & Pearls. “It’s a boutique concept, with a curated and tech-enhanced experience blending affordable luxury and couture with a refined, elevated environment,” said Elina Vilk, president and chief business officer of David’s Bridal, in an interview. “Today’s brides are looking for more than a dress. They are looking for an immersive, shopping experience.” With the opening of the 3,500-square-foot Diamonds & Pearls at 9097 West Atlantic Avenue, Suite 104 in Delray Beach, Fla., “We saw an opportunity to reimagine the bridal journey through innovation, curation and style,” Vilk said. The official opening is May 29, though there’s already been a few “soft opening” days to get out any kinks.

It still has some of the same selections as David’s Bridal, with approximately one-third of the stock keeping units typically found in a traditional David’s Bridal store, but is curated to the most trending styles and silhouettes. There are also some exclusive designer offerings, from Viola Chan and Marchesa, as well as David Bridal’s signature lines such as Galina Signature, Oleg Cassini and Melissa Sweet, among other labels. Chan will work with clients on a custom design, either in person or through virtual calls. In addition, appointments can be arranged with personal stylists, Champagne is served, walk-ins are welcomed as well and trunk shows are planned.

The future may bring additional Diamonds & Pearls stores, as the company is close to signing another lease on the Northeast Coast. But before green-lighting an expansion of Diamonds & Pearls, Vilk and her team will analyze the performance of the first store for the next four or five months. “We are ‘test and learn’ people,” Vilk said. “We want to see how this store goes, but we anticipate this will be a big part of our strategy next year.” There’s been “so much demand” for the kind of bridal shopping experience Diamonds & Pearls provides. Prices start at $400 to $500, average just over $2,000, and go as high as $6,000 or $7,000 for a custom couture gown, Vilk said. “We are way more affordable than many bridal boutiques,” she said, suggesting other boutiques typically average out with a $4,000 to $5,000 price point. The launch of Diamonds & Pearls reflects David’s Bridal’s rebuilding efforts after going in and out of bankruptcy two times in the last seven years, in 2018 and 2023, leading to the sale of the company to asset manager Cion Investment. (“Diamonds and Pearls” is also the name of a 1991 Prince album.) “We’re actually doing pretty well,” Vilk said when asked how the business is currently performing. “We are completely changing the strategy and driving innovation with concepts like Diamonds & Pearls, becoming more asset-light and taking a tech-forward approach.” Vilk said David’s Bridal is rebuilding its wedding planning service, started a retail media company in January, and is looking at new AI tools. “Gen Z brides are tech-forward. They don’t start their journey in the store anymore. She’ll browse online first, then see it on social media,” said Vilk, a former Hootsuite, Meta, PayPal and Visa executive. “And she wants affordable luxury.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.
