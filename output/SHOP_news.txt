Two particular lines in Elon Musk's posts about Tesla's new chip deal highlight just how far his "founder mode" approach extends. In this case, right down to his stated terms of Tesla's manufacturing agreement with Samsung. In a $16.5 billion deal, Samsung will produce Tesla's new AI6 chip from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026. Located outside of Austin, Samsung's plant is close to where Musk moved in 2020, and where his company Tesla later moved in 2021. In an X post, Musk wrote that he would personally monitor the plant's activity. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress," Musk wrote. "And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house." In other words — "founder mode." Musk also wrote that Samsung "agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency." The Tesla CEO wrote that the deal, which Bloomberg first reported, was one of "strategic importance" for the automaker. Neither Tesla nor Samsung responded to a request for comment. Musk has long been known for taking a founder-mode approach to running his companies, an in-the-details entrepreneurial mindset that has flourished in Silicon Valley. He famously slept on the factory floor during Tesla's Model 3. He personally renamed and reorganized an entire company when taking over Twitter, now X, and he set up shop in D.C. during his DOGE era. The term "founder mode" itself, though, is newer. Its origins stem from a 2024 talk that Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky gave for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. In it, he advised against the common principle that leaders of large-scale companies should hire good employees and give them space to do their job. In a September essay titled "Founder Mode," YC cofounder Paul Graham reflected on Chesky's talk, writing that there are "things founders can do that managers can't." Graham coined the term "founder mode," describing leaders of big companies who work on the ground across the company, delving into the details at a granular level, and not just via their direct reports. Chesky later embraced the mantra named after his talk, along with much of Silicon Valley. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote on X that "we need founder mode companies in all industries." In his essay, Graham thanked a variety of tech leaders for reading early drafts, including YC CEO Garry Tan, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Musk himself. While the terms Musk describes for Tesla's manufacturing deal and his plans to personally walk the Samsung assembly line are very "founder mode," he's not the only CEO keeping a close eye on a company's supply chain. Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple before becoming CEO by closely managing Apple's supply chain. The iPhone giant famously keeps a very close eye on its manufacturing partners, many of which are in China. A United airport sign photographed in 2019 and confirmed to be legitimate by the airline revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats a day for its employees to travel from San Francisco to Shanghai, a travel hub connecting to Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, which have been called "iPhone cities." The iPhone maker is also known for having a broad team of operations overseers. Samsung's new chip deal with Tesla marks a major win for its foundry business. As of 1 p.m. in New York, the company's stock price was up 6.8%. And while Tesla's assembly line workers have experienced Elon Musk's founder mode approach, it sounds like soon Samsung's will too.

Title: The Q4 Campaign Checklist Every Ecommerce Marketer Needs

Ecommerce marketers face their biggest test in Q4, when three months of revenue outweigh the other nine combined. Industry forecasts put this year’s holiday spend just shy of the trillion-dollar mark, and online’s share keeps edging higher. Email alone steers a meaningful slice of that cash, and any inbox veteran knows that send volume lifts sharply once Halloween decorations hit the clearance aisle. When that swell arrives, campaigns that looked flawless in July buckle if their plumbing or targeting is even slightly off-spec. The smarter approach is to prepare, not repair. Conduct extensive performance audits on your critical systems well before the holiday surge to ensure you’re ready to operate at scale, rather than just reacting to issues as they arise. During peak shopping seasons, your automated marketing flows are put under immense pressure. A welcome series that runs smoothly in May, for example, can clog and fail completely when holiday traffic overwhelms the system. Treat these automations like a bridge that needs to be stress-tested before a flood. Build a replica of each customer journey and subject it to a deluge of traffic equivalent to last year’s Cyber Five, scaled up to account for this year’s growth. The goal is often to see where the strain causes things to break. The first issue to appear is almost always timing. For example, a cart abandonment email intended to arrive within 30 minutes might show up hours late. Soon after, more subtle bugs emerge, such as customers getting stuck in logic loops, product recommendations timing out due to overloaded inventory systems, and time-zone rules misfiring. Once those mechanical kinks are identified and addressed, the focus shifts from when messages are triggered to what they convey. Holiday shoppers are racing the clock, so the storytelling that resonated in July now takes a back seat to hard logistics. They want fast confirmation that the item is in stock, that it will arrive before the party, and that returns won’t turn into a January headache. Crafting copy around those assurances can turn a functioning flow into one that actually converts when the stakes (and the traffic) are highest. Start your holiday marketing strategy long before the first chill of autumn. Begin by segmenting customers into four distinct groups, each with a tailored approach. Instead of sending generic coupons, show recent purchasers smart, inventory-aware cross-sells. Offer your most loyal, multi-buy customers early access to treat them like VIPs and protect profits. For price-sensitive customers, create a sense of urgency with firm deadlines and shorter sales windows. Re-engage lapsed customers not with discounts, but with delivery guarantees. Locking in these segments early gives your creative teams the breathing room to build versatile assets without the usual holiday rush. Also, it gives your finance team a clear forecast to better align profit goals with each group and prevent the gradual slide into unplanned discounts. The result is that when the holiday ads flood everyone’s feed, your message is already resonating. This preparation also gives us the headroom to experiment thoughtfully instead of constantly firefighting. Even flawless targeting will fail if your tech can’t keep pace with holiday traffic, so the third checkpoint is a walkthrough with your engineering team. Begin with deliverability and your ESP. If you’re adding a new dedicated sending IP, start “warming” it (gradually increasing volume) now rather than waiting until mid-November. Next, confirm that your email-authentication records (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) still line up after any seasonal domain tweaks. If a reputation problem surfaces on Cyber Monday, you’ll be stuck in the spam folder long after shoppers stop buying. This is the same thing for SMS. Carriers tighten spam policing during the holidays, and a malformed opt-out reply can freeze throughput across an entire shortcode. A controlled flash-sale testing to an internal seed list may show latency issues and confirms HELP/STOP routing behaviors as expected. Finally, conduct a live-fire load test on Shopify. Replay last year’s peak session count plus a healthy safety buffer, then step through at least two checkout paths: the native flow and an accelerated wallet like Shop Pay. Watch for scripts, upsell apps, and discount combinators vying for the same resources; a race condition invisible in off-season traffic can freeze hundreds of carts in the heat of Cyber Week. Run analytics tracing in parallel to confirm that every purchase fires the correct attribution events. Clean data fuels mid-flight adjustments and, just as importantly, underpins January’s budget conversations. Q4 doesn’t reward clever last-minute ideas; it rewards the teams that prepare by July and August like an innovation lab, make September like a live systems rehearsal, and October as a glide path. By the time shoppers start penciling gift lists, your flows should be bulletproof, your segments precisely mapped, and your infrastructure ready for the surge. This operational discipline turns the holidays into a predictable growth engine, which essentially leaves you free to chase incremental wins instead of hunting down mysterious bottlenecks. When New Year’s Eve rolls in and dashboards show record highs, you’ll know the calm wasn’t luck—it was the payoff of engineering peak season you implemented before the first order rolled in.
