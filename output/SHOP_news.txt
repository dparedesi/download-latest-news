What caught my eye this week. Nobody asked for it and now it’s here – the new Monevator shop is open, offering in-joke themed investing T-shirts and vaguely punny sweatshirts to all. Perhaps you’ve already spotted Monevator members striding about town sporting fancy wares like this: Yes, those cool cats got early access. Thanks to everyone who bought something and so beta-tested the new store for us. Now to repeat what I said to them, being a Monevator member is by far the best way to support the site. The margins on digital products are unbeatable – after the taxman has taken his share most of the money goes to us. This helps to keep the lights on and us publishing, week after week. In particular, please don’t buy anything from the shop if you think there’s a chance you’ll return it. The margins are terrible and returns will wipe them out. We’re only really doing this for strategic brand-building mindshare capture mutual fun. There’s an FAQ. Our merch is made by print-on-demand giant Printful, and all payments are securely handled by the globe-spanning Shopify. Finally, you’ll also find a digital bookshop (it links to Amazon) of our 24 favourite investing books. Hope to see you at an investing conference or under a Canary Wharf skyscraper – or failing that at the gym – in a Monevator hoodie soon! Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Congrats on getting the “merch” up and running. I hadn’t realised that you had given members early access: was that in a email/newsletter? Note that I intentionally killed off emails/newsletters as I prefer to read posts on this website, so may have missed the alert this way. @Curlew — Yes, besides it being a little membership perk I introduced the shop to members in stages to stagger any support issues if anything didn’t work and also to stop our working capital getting overwhelmed with demand (because we have to pay up front for the merch to be made) Needn’t have overly worried on either score 😉 Boom. In like Flynn for a DNFS t shirt to wear in the gym. Great way to be able to support a fantastic resource. Free shipping too! You spoil us. @TI Thanks for the clarification. Note that I couldn’t find anywhere in the account settings to turn on/off newsletters/emails…I had to resort to the blunt instrument of creating an email rule to delete to anything from you, no offence 🙂 Moreover, after signing up to membership I never received newsletters at all (which was fine) but after a few months they suddenly started appearing in my inbox. Odd. Hence why I tried to find a way of stopping them. You could have caps, like Make Investing Great Again caps… Typoette “Michael Sheen writes of £1m of debt …..” With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb On the subject of filling in missing years of NI, has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest, but it obviously varies with a few parameters and some soft factors that are not straightforward to predict (eg means testing potentially being introduced one day) .ls. “arbdn” sh..ld b. abrdn sh..ld .t n.t 🙂 @Factor – you missed Dali/Dalio @Rob (8) That’s like comparing the certainty of an annuity with the vagaries of drawdown. The drawdown option would probably pay off but there are no guarantees. Everything I’ve heard suggests that buying missing years of NI contributions is a bargain for the near-certain guaranteed income it buys. This should remain at least CPI-inflation-protected even if the triple lock does not survive. Of course, it is important to ensure that the extra years you buy will actually improve your state pension. If you will reach 35 years anyway before SPA it will not help, and you have to be very careful about filling in gaps before 2016. Thanks for the orders guys — and for the typo spots! (I’m embarrassed about missing the Dalio ‘o’ but I’m absolutely letting myself off the abrdn SNAFU 😉 ) @Rob It’s currently £17.45 for a class 3 stamp (per week) State pension is £6.32 for each of the 35 required stamp years. £221.20 pw for 24/25 with 35 years ) If I was a 66 year old the annuity rate would be 36% v current open market annuity rates of about 4%. To me it looks close to the best investment one could make. The best being class 2 Ni £3.45 per week. Paying for extra year a long time before retirement may change the numbers but surely not enough to be worth not buying the extra year. I think Ermine has some thoughts on one of his posts @Rob #8 has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest Perhaps you have the gift of exceptional youth and hence a long appreciation time, but it’s really hard to beat a over 100% annuity rate at Class II rates – my old post on the SP has been overtaken by some changes but the principle is still there. Provisos are that it is rational to make up missing years later in your working life rather than earlier (you must make them before reaching SPA) because you don’t know your career path. Early retirees by definition have a shorter working life than most. You need 35 qualifying years – my working life was 30 so I was 5 years short. I bought an extra SP annuity for ~£900 what it would have cost me 23k on the open market. You run, not walk, towards that sort of proposition. Early retirees ought to be able to swing the Class II NI by declaring self employment and earning pin money. You don’t actually have to make any money, and you are usually in self-assessment anyway due to investments. I’d certainly say double check your working and I’d be intrigued as to how you come to that conclusion, assuming you do not have any reason to expect a shorter life expectancy than usual. @Pinch #7 > With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below Normal users won’t notice any difference and if your Kindle breaks you can register the replacement to your Amazon account and get your old stuff, barring rare edge cases. Amazon are doing this to stiff people who break the DRM’d books out of the digital rights management. So they can read the books on other ereaders or their computers. I will investigate alternative suppliers because I reject monopolist’s rights to control what I do with my stuff and my equipment. At any rate I will buy fewer books form them and favour secondhand real books, even if I give them away after reading. But it’s not a problem if you are a normal consumer 😉 @ermine – 14 Last I read was that making investments left you eligible for Class 2 NICs, regardless of earning pin money, or am I missing something? https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates talks about “people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission” @ermine Books… I’ve been giving Amazon the heave ho for quite some time. I mostly use World of Books, they operate on a circular economy model, and authors receive something on the sale of s/h books. I use the WoB website, rather than on Ebay. Cheaper that way. Thanks for the useful replies about NI contributions. I would reach SPA in 2046 (as things stand currently) and expect to have 25/35 years completed by 2033. I have the option to make class 3 contributions at slightly reduced rate for five missing years. If I can make class 2 voluntary contributions from 2033 then I should reach full record not long before I would be eligible to receive state pension. I was not aware that making investments for myself qualified for class 2 contributions, that changes the calculation enormously. There is always the risk that the system is changed somewhat by then but this seems the best bet for now. I’m surprised that there has been little or no discussion on Monevator around the talk of possible changes to the rules relating to cash ISAs and the possible reduction to a £4k annual limit. @Rob #18 >investments Yeah, but do make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes 😉 I’d be wary of using investments for that reason. Even if it were in your ISA it would be a pity to make your ISA taxable! You do need to register as self-employed for the year, and make sure it is the entire tax year. Being in self-assessment (SA) is not enough. Self-employment requirements are pretty lax. I once declared a £50 profit for running the PA for an event, that was enough. You don’t even need to make a profit to be self-employed. Sell something on ebay, but do not take the £1000 trading allowance in your SA form if you want to pay class II NI. Certainly agree it’s irrational to pay now if you will have 13 years post-retirement in 2033 to make up 10 years. All sorts of things can change in the next 8 years, you may need to work longer, or not, those 8 years the capital could be used to invest. The point I was querying is that compared to investment this was a poor deal – but it still makes sense to defer buying the years later where it makes no difference, you may as well use the money in the meantime! There have been rumblings about canning Class II NI since forever, the post-GFC coalition gov made a lot of noise about that and I was frightened of that disappearing in 2012. Never happened. There was talk of it post-covid as the Covid bung for the self-employed caused some reflection. Didn’t happen. Even at Class III rates it’s a steal compared to an open market annuity rate. Still worth keeping a watch on the space for rule changes. @ermine #20 > make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes I’d be wary of using investments for that reason If you are registered as a self employed investor (people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission) then you are on special rules where you have the option of paying voluntary class 2 contributions. But how would you calculate profit for class 4? My understanding of the rules is that in that category your profit is zero as you are not “getting a fee or commission”. Hence them giving you the option of paying voluntary class 2. If you had any profit to make you pay compulsory class 4 then the special regime would not be necessary. This is the same for example for another profession in that list of special rules, “ ministers of religion who do not receive a salary or stipend”. No salary, no profit, no class 4. @Grumpy Tortoise — We were on this ages ago, see the following post from early Feb and comments that follow: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-surely-not-cash-isas/ Returning to it would just be speculation and clickbait really. We’ll certainly cover it again if there’s concrete legislation, or solid confirmation! 🙂 https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual/nim74250 I’m not convinced FIRE style home investors qualify for class 2 ni , the discussion (tldr) on landlords seems to err on needing to begainfully employed on the activity rather than bring passive etc. Happy to be wrong I’ve got my 35. Means testing and country bankruptcy are my bigger concerns Class 3 is still too generous- perhaps Rachel will spot it Market mini crash mini special/Naughty corner Active Antics: 1). Verdad x 2: a). kurtosis + skewness so important, yet undercovered; b). Land of rising sun shows promise in SC space (overweight both Jap SC and Value, and looking for options for Jap micro/nano caps and SCV). 2). FT x 3: a). can’t see why investors would avoid UK SCs and ITs. There’s opportunity there. b). The big picture (5 yr+) on US large cap’s always looks good: https://www.tker.co/p/stock-market-performance-after-down-days But I’ve a bad feeling about this. The SPY and the S&P momentum index now both at/below 200 DSMA (latter for 1st time since 2023). With the orange emperor in charge and set on tariffs, valuations stretched, GPT 4.5 flopping, hyperscalars forgoing more power generation (a bad demand signal regardless of DeekSeek efficiencies): things looking less than rosy in the US large/mega cap space. A crash, if it comes, could be a good long term (decades view) entry point though. @Boltt #23 Thanks for that link, shame it only seems to be able to give landlording examples. I can see how managing a portfolio for you and your partner perhaps does not qualify as “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” unless it involves lots of active trading. But then I wonder what HMRC’s view would be on “a £50 profit for running the PA for an event” for a whole tax year. That can’t possibly be “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” either. @Delta Hedge — Well, the house Monevator view is of course “who knows”. Stranger things have happened than the market rallying on the back of an arsonist administration apparently wanting to bring back the 1930s quite wilfully, in terms at least of the Great Depression via tariffs and who knows what else besides. Maybe if the market sniffs out hyperinflation, though stagflation would seem likelier if they really do enact these announced tariffs and the same on Europe. That said BTCUSD seems to be giving up the ghost, and if the US market really was priced-to-perfection then it’s hard to argue that this is perfection, surely… @TI #26, first sentence second paragraph is perfection, like reading Evelyn Waugh (passages in bridesmaid) and thinking ‘wow, what a feat of language’… I enjoyed the link to Noahpinion for similar reasons.. We should hope for the big bear. The money is made in deep bear markets. That’s the opportunity to buy quality growth at an attractive risk to reward. AMZN split adjusted (1 share at May 1997 IPO @$18 = 240 shares at Feb 2025 peak @$225 each) hit $4.5 in Dec 1999 (~60x the split adjusted IPO of 7.5 cents), but could be had for just 37 cents in Sep 2001. Likewise PLTR went from $10 at Sep 2020 IPO to over $35 in Jan 2021 before falling to ~$6 in Dec 2022, after which it hit ATH a few weeks back of $125.41. *If* Trump now crashes the US economy then high beta tech should crater the most in the short run, even though (provided that stagflation is avoided of course) the lower rates eventuating from the contraction should follow IDC, thereby lifting all equity valuations, but most especially for high growth potential firms. Rather than going 100% in/out now, the wiser course (given that, as Peter Lynch liked to say, more money has been lost in trying to avoid the crashes than actually in them); might instead be to just stay invested broadly/ passively and, if there’s no crash, then do nowt; and, if there is a crash, then go buy up the deeply discounted high growth plays in expectation for the upswing (which might be 6 months, 2 years or a decade out, but always comes eventually, and is invariably longer lived than the bear market it replaced).
