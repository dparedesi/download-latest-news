Selling products online, be they physical or digital, has never been easier than it is today. The e-commerce field has grown past simple third-party tools that are tacked on to web hosting plans. Now, many e-commerce platforms offer website builders and domain registration (though, web hosting services support e-commerce integration, too). With this blending of utility, the e-commerce platform matters less than the features you need to connect with potential customers. Check out Shopify and Wix Stores, our top picks, plus the category's other noteworthy platforms before you build an online shop. E-commerce software lets you track and manage product inventory, as well as fulfill and ship orders. It helps you maintain a product database, track sales, market to customers, offer discounts, maintain a loyalty program, and even create a blog to connect with potential customers. Even better, there are numerous turnkey bundles available that combine custom or name brand shopping cart solutions with e-commerce-focused web hosting services, banks and payment processors, as well as e-commerce fulfillment and warehousing operators. The problem with such complex, do-it-all services, however, is that it's tough to know how to evaluate them or even where to begin. Don't worry, we're here to lend a helping hand. Before we talk about what to look for in a e-commerce service, you may be wondering why you need one. As mentioned earlier, many web hosting services now offer e-commerce packages as part of their hosting plans, using built-in tools or integrating with open-source tools. It boils down to just how much extra work you, as a small business owner, want to put in to manage your store from scratch. It's just another set of hoops through which to jump if you have to set up your own merchant account and payment gateway. Plus, everything is on the web now: If you make your customers place an order and then call you with their credit card information, you are going to lose a lot of sales. A PayPal button on your website is a good first step, but if you want to operate an attractive, modern online storefront from which people can shop day or night, then you really are better off using full-featured e-commerce platform instead of trying to glue all of the separate parts together on your own. E-commerce services streamline the relationship between buyers and sellers by handling multiple payment methods, collecting tax, and calculating shipping costs. A straightforward shopping experience means buyers get the product faster, too. A happy customer is just good business, after all. It's difficult to choose an e-commerce platform strictly based on price. Some offer advanced features, but impose restrictions on transaction or monthly data transfers; others limit a plan's features by price. Most e-commerce tools offer templates (also known as themes), but some may fence off popular ones into their premium packages. That means you must pay more money for an attractive website. A website builder is useful for customizing templates. Some services may have a low monthly cost, but charge fees for transactions and for add-ons that let you integrate with third-party tools. Depending on your requirements, you can expect to see prices as low as $9.99 and as high as thousands of dollars per month. As always, it pays to read the fine print. There are two types of transaction fees to keep track of when evaluating e-commerce services: the ones charged by the shopping cart and the ones charged by the payment gateway. You can't avoid the payment gateway fees; whichever service you select will charge a certain amount per credit card transaction. That's the fee from Authorize.Net or PayPal, for example. Some e-commerce platforms charge an additional transaction fee for using the service regardless of the payment gateway. This means you pay your shopping cart vendor a certain percentage per transaction before the payment gateway collects its fee. Consider this scenario: A customer came to your store and paid $100 via PayPal. Your vendor will collect $3.20 for that transaction and PayPal will collect $3.20 (the actual amount will vary based on your PayPal account type). E-commerce platform typically offer bandwidth restrictions if they don't charge transaction fees. Many services have tiers based on how much monthly data you need. If you expect high traffic volumes and sales, then you should look at unlimited plans or at least something more generous than the typical 1GB of bandwidth. Others restrict storage, which limits the number and size of product images you can display. Cheaper plans have smaller storage capacity, so if you have a fairly large product database or plan to have multiple images per product, then you will have to think about how much you need. Otherwise, that monthly bill with overage fees is going to be a surprise. Monthly data is consumed whenever visitors swing by your website. If you list several images for a single product or you have a long slideshow, then that will eat up data. In that case, you'll need a generous data allotment. Think carefully about what you want from your store to determine if bandwidth limits or transaction fees make sense for you. Some e-commerce services are better suited for selling physical goods, while others support digital and virtual products, such as ebooks and services. As a result, you need to think about the types of products you want to sell before selecting a service. Some e-commerce companies let you migrate data from an existing service. They handle bulk, product database uploads, as well as moving customer and order history. If you aren't setting up a brand-new storefront, then you really need to look for e-commerce tools to help with the move. Look for plans that let you organize inventory and maintain a customer database. If there aren't any built-in tools, see if you can integrate your cart with a third-party service. If you plan to send emails from your e-commerce website, then MailChimp, for example, might integrate with your service tier. See if you can issue discounts, gift certificates, and run sales. You want search engine optimization (SEO) tools to help your storefront rise up in search results. You should consider integrating Google Analytics (GA) into the dashboard to understand who is coming to your store and what they are doing. You won't need GA if the shopping cart provides its own website metrics, but it's still a good tool to consider using with your store. Don't rely on documentation, tutorials, and forums for customer support. Those are great resources but, ideally, you should be able to get someone on the phone or in a web chat, at least. Ideally, the support should be available at any hour of the day. You don't know when things will go wrong, so why should you have to wait for normal business hours to get help? Many e-commerce tools offer trial periods. Take advantage of the trial to learn how to work with the shopping cart dashboard. If you find it annoying to see the placed orders, enter products, or fulfill orders, move on to a shopping cart that fits into your workflow. Finally, think about security. While many of your customers will shop while using a virtual private network (VPN) service, there are still plenty who won't. To protect them, make sure your online store and its underlying web hosting provider either offer a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or can accommodate a third-party certificate you purchase from someone else. In addition, make sure to invest in a dependable website monitoring tool to stay on top of any security or performance issues in real time. Take a look at the table below to determine the e-commerce features that you need for your online store. If you already have a store with one of these services and want to tell us about your experiences (good or bad), then let us know in the comments. Have an opinion about a store we didn't list here? Let us know that, too. Juan Martinez and Mike Williams also contributed to this story.

Title: Where Should Your Money Be In 2025?

Financial Planning for new year 2025 As 2025 gains momentum, you may be thinking about your investment portfolio. Where will the opportunities lie in the new year? As I’ve noted in the past, investors are once again faced with a landscape of opportunities and risks shaped by macroeconomic trends, evolving consumer behavior, and technological innovation—much of which has little to no historical precedent. While there are some solid stock options and interesting alternatives, looking farther afield for investment opportunities can be difficult. If you’re unsure what to do with your money in the months ahead, here are some high-level insights into where some of the most important industries stand and how they may fare in the upcoming year. The multifamily housing sector continues to show resilience, bolstered by strong demand for rental properties. “As the financial hurdles of buying a home persist and interest rates plateau, multifamily housing is emerging as the clear choice for many,” notes Chuck Bryant, Jr., COO of Roial Group, an investment firm focused on affordable multifamily housing. “This surge in rental demand, alongside strong economic conditions, highlight the enduring strength of multifamily investments.” “The U.S. faces a critical shortage of affordable rental housing,” Bryant emphasizes, “with only 33 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households.” Other data backs up this statistic. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to meet demand. This shortfall is driven by rising housing prices, a shift in consumer preferences toward renting, and demographic trends such as delayed homeownership among millennials and Gen Z. “This persistent gap,” says Bryant, “ensures steady demand, making affordable housing a stable and impactful investment opportunity for 2024 and beyond." For those who wish to have exposure to multifamily real estate without managing their own properties, multifamily real estate investment trusts could be a solution. For 2025, REITs are poised to benefit from a strong rental market, especially in high-demand urban and suburban areas. However, investors should stay up to date on other factors. Rising interest rates, for instance, could pose challenges for new developments, increasing borrowing costs and potentially slowing construction activity. Technology remains a cornerstone of modern portfolios, with artificial intelligence and cloud computing serving as key growth drivers. Gartner estimates that global spending on AI systems will explode over the next few years, growing at around 19.1% annually through 2027. Companies like Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market, and Microsoft, a leader in cloud services, are at the forefront of this transformation. They remain solid investment options as this initial AI investment run plays out in the coming years. The semiconductor industry is another area to watch. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 has incentivized domestic semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This move is expected to bolster companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, investors should remain cautious about valuations. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has rebounded significantly in 2024, leading to concerns about overvaluation. Don’t overcommit here. The energy sector presents a mixed outlook, with oil and gas facing headwinds and alternative energy gaining momentum. On the traditional side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global oil demand will plateau by 2030, but short-term disruptions could drive prices higher in 2025. Geopolitical tensions and production cuts by OPEC+ have already led to price spikes in 2024, creating opportunities for companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. Alternative energy, however, is where growth potential truly lies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated $369 billion toward clean energy projects, sparking a surge in investment. Solar power alone is expected to account for 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The ‘electrification of everything’ is more than just the most important macro tailwind for renewables,” says Glenn Jacobson, Managing Partner at Greenbelt Capital, a private equity leader in the energy sector. “It’s reshaping the entire energy landscape, as well as the computer, transportation, and industrial sectors. This shift represents a massive structural transformation, driving unprecedented demand for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.” Jacobson narrows his prediction to a combination of production and growth, saying, “I’m most bullish on solar and solar-plus-storage, both at the grid-scale and distributed levels, due to their unmatched economics. However, we’re set to see broad-based capacity growth across multiple energy sources. This expansion will go hand-in-hand with massive grid infrastructure investments as the market adjusts to a generational surge in both energy supply and electricity demand.” Solar has been a long-term investment option for years. Don’t expect it to lose its luster in 2025. The retail sector is navigating a complex environment characterized by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures. E-commerce continues to expand, with online sales projected to grow by 8.6% in 2025, according to Oberlo. Amazon (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) remain dominant players. However, niche platforms catering to specific demographics are also gaining traction. Brick-and-mortar retail, on the other hand, is undergoing a transformation. Experiential retail, which focuses on creating unique in-store experiences, is gaining popularity. Companies like Lululemon (LULU) and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) have embraced this trend and delivered strong financial performance. However, like real estate interest rates, inflation poses a significant challenge for the retail sector. Rising costs for goods and services could dampen consumer spending, particularly in discretionary categories. Retailers with robust pricing power and strong brand loyalty are better equipped to navigate this environment. The healthcare sector remains a front-line area of innovation. It continues to offer a compelling case for long-term investment driven by demographic trends and technological advancements. The aging global population is increasing the demand for healthcare services, while breakthroughs in biotechnology and medical devices are creating new opportunities. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) continue to invest in vaccine development and gene therapies. Meanwhile, medical device companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are innovating in areas like minimally invasive surgery and cardiovascular health. Healthcare REITs, which focus on properties like senior living facilities and medical offices, also present a stable investment option. With a projected annual growth rate of 5.6% per year for healthcare expenditures through 2032, according to data shared by Becker’s Hospital CFO Report, the sector is poised for sustained growth. Investing may be an old concept, but it’s never looked like it does right now. Technology, economics, culture, politics, globalization, and countless other elements are influencing the investment landscape like never before. It’s important to consider where your money should go in 2025, and the real estate, tech, energy, retail, and healthcare sectors remain leading options for the months ahead. One Community.

Title: WooCommerce Extensions: 8 Must-Haves To Turn Your Store From Blah to Brilliant

“I’ve got my e-commerce store up, but sales are stagnant. I feel like I’m missing something.” We frequently hear this from small business owners. And you know what? They’re right. Having a basic WooCommerce shop isn’t enough anymore. Your customers expect seamless checkouts, personalized recommendations, and flexible payment options. WooCommerce extensions can help fix this — They’re tiny power-ups for your online store that come together to make things simpler. With over six million active WooCommerce stores worldwide and a 35% global e-commerce market share, you can be sure that successful WooCommerce stores aren’t using the basic platform alone. They’re using extensions to create exceptional shopping experiences that keep customers coming back. In this guide, we’ll explain: Read on to take your WooCommerce store from bland to brilliant. Think of WooCommerce as your store’s foundation. It gives you the basics: product pages, a shopping cart, and checkout. However, running your e-commerce store requires more. That’s where WooCommerce extensions come in. Extensions are add-ons that enhance your store’s capabilities. They’re like apps for your smartphone — each one offers a new feature to make your store run better. If you don’t already have it, here’s how to install WooCommerce on WordPress. You’ll find two types of WooCommerce extensions on the market: Pro tip: Start with free extensions to understand what your store needs. Then, invest in premium options for the features that matter most to your business. If you’re considering which e-commerce platform will work for you, this article comparing WooCommerce and Shopify is a great starting point. Extensions improve your store’s functionality for you and your customers. We’ve watched hundreds of store owners transform their businesses with these tools, and we’ll share exactly how each one could help you. Here are eight extensions from the WooCommerce marketplace that can help you transform your store. Subscribe now to receive all the latest updates, delivered directly to your inbox. First things first, let’s talk about payments. To maintain a top-notch customer experience, you need to make checkout seamless on your websites. Remember the last time you had to accept multiple payment systems and reports? WooPayments brings everything into one place, right in your WooCommerce dashboard. Key features: Why it works: You’ll spend less time managing payments and more time growing your business. Plus, having everything in one place makes tax season much less stressful. Stripe is a decade-old payments company with a simple goal: making payments as easy as possible. Some of the largest companies today use Stripe, including Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Marriott, and the list goes on and on. Key features: Why it works: The easier you make it to pay, the more sales you’ll complete. If your customers can checkout with one click, they’re more likely to purchase from you. Sometimes, having a familiar logo is all you need to push a customer into making a purchase. PayPal has been a trusted payment provider for over two decades, and it’s impossible to deny its popularity among customers. Accepting PayPal payments on your store can be a great way to add a sense of familiarity. Key features: Why it works: Many customers feel more confident buying from a new store when they see PayPal as an option. It’s especially useful if you’re just starting out or if you’re targeting first-time customers. Plus, the Buy Now, Pay Later option often encourages larger purchases — helpful when you sell higher-priced items. After streamlining the payments, you must strategize how to attract customers. This is where extensions let you focus on marketing while they handle the technicalities. Getting your products in front of the right customers can be challenging. Google for WooCommerce connects your store directly to where most shopping journeys begin — Google Search. Key features: Why it works: Your products appear in Google Shopping results, Google Search, and even Google Images — places where customers are actively looking to buy. This also improves SEO for your store, giving you an additional channel to bring in customers. Ever wonder how major retailers seem to know exactly what to suggest next? Amazon does this well. It suggests highly relevant products on the product and cart pages to encourage buyers to add more products to their order. This extension brings that same smart recommendation engine to your store. Key features: Why it works: When customers see products that match their interests, they’re likely to buy more products and stick around longer— helping improve your website conversion rate. A website conversion is any action a user takes on a site that moves them further into the sales funnel. Examples include filling out a web form, clicking a call to action, or purchasing a product. Discounts can be powerful, but basic percentage-off coupons aren’t always the answer. Advanced Coupons lets you create promotions that make the most sense for your business. Key features: Why it works: You can create promotions that encourage larger purchases while protecting your margins. This tool is particularly useful during seasonal sales or when you need to move specific inventory. Window shopping has gone digital. A wishlist lets customers save items for later, creating a bridge between browsing and buying. Key features: Why it works: Customers often need time to decide on purchases. Wishlists keep them connected to your store and make it easy to return and complete their purchase when they’re ready. Every customer is unique, and sometimes they want products that reflect that. Product Add-Ons lets you offer customization options. Key features: Why it works: When customers can personalize their purchases, they’re not just buying a product — they’re creating something unique. This often leads to higher satisfaction and repeat purchases. While Jetpack isn’t a WooCommerce-specific extension, but it is a powerful WordPress toolkit created by Automattic (the team behind WordPress) that can bolster your store’s security and performance. Instead of juggling multiple plugins for backups, spam filtering, analytics, and speed enhancements, Jetpack provides an all-in-one solution: Jetpack handles essential tasks like security checks and performance optimizations so can you focus on running your store. With its all-in-one support, you’ll have a stable, secure foundation for long-term growth. Not everyone needs the extensive customization that comes with WooCommerce. Sometimes you need something that just works out of the box, with minimal setup and maintenance. Instead of managing multiple extensions, Ecwid gives you everything in one dashboard: The best part? You get essential e-commerce features without managing multiple extensions or handling the technicalities. And as your business grows, you can unlock more features and product listings to further enhance your store. Both WooCommerce and Ecwid can get you where you need to go. You just need to choose the amount of customizability and features you want to manage independently. Too much of anything can be harmful. This also applies to WooCommerce extensions. You want to keep your site as light as possible while still gaining the features you need. Let’s look at how you can go about it. Instead of thinking, “I need more extensions,” ask yourself these questions: Begin with extensions that solve your most pressing problems. This could include issues such as a slow website, a large number of uncompressed images, or a lack of cart abandonment recovery. You can always add more later as different opportunities appear. Here’s something many store owners learn the hard way: every extension can impact your store’s speed. Think of it like filling your car up with luggage. At some point, it will be way too heavy and affect performance. So, what should you watch for? Installing extensions doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s your straightforward process: Always back up your store. You can also use a plugin like Updraft Plus to auto-backup before installing or updating any WooCommerce themes or plugins. Then, download the extension from the WooCommerce marketplace. Alternatively, you can click on Plugins > Add New Plugin from the left sidebar on your WordPress dashboard. Here, you can search for the required plugins. If you’ve downloaded a zip file from the WooCommerce marketplace, simply click the Upload Plugin button at the top of the Add New Plugin page. After the upload completes, you’ll have the option to activate the plugin. Note: Always test new extensions on a staging site first. It’s like trying on clothes before buying — it’s better to know if something fits before committing. Every added extension needs maintenance. That’s yet another reason to keep things light. The good news is that WooCommerce and WordPress provide automatic updates, minimizing the need for manual maintenance. Here are some key things to remember with website maintenance: Remember: your store’s security is only as strong as its weakest link. Choose extensions from trusted sources and keep everything updated. The WooCommerce Marketplace is your safest bet. WooCommerce may seem overwhelming compared to newer, more streamlined platforms. However, this flexibility is exactly what makes it powerful. You can build precisely the store you need, piece by piece, without being locked into a one-size-fits-all solution. WooCommerce extensions are the building blocks that help make that happen. Start small, keep testing, and retain flexibility while building your store. The most successful stores aren’t the ones with the most WooCommerce extensions or features — they’re the ones that have figured out exactly what works for their store and what doesn’t.
