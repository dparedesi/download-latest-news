The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, but it missed analysts' expectations on revenue for the July-through-September period. Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the fourth quarter, PayPal is calling for "low single-digit growth." Analysts were expecting growth of 5.4% to $8.46 billion in revenue. The investor deck says guidance reflects a "price-to-value strategy and prioritization of profitable growth." The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.11, versus the average analyst estimate of $1.10, according to LSEG. Revenue increased about 6% in the quarter from $7.42 billion in the same period a year ago. PayPal reported net income of $1.01 billion, or 99 cents per share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. It's the first earnings report for CEO Alex Chriss since he reached his one-year mark on the job in September. Coming into Tuesday, PayPal's stock was up 36% this year and 42% since Chriss joined the payments company, which at the time was mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree, which is used by Meta for credit card processing, and payments app Venmo. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, rose 9% from a year earlier to $422.6 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, and came in just above the average analyst estimate of $422.5 billion, according to StreetAccount. The company's operating margin was 18.8%, beating the StreetAccount estimate of 17.4%. PayPal reported total active accounts of 432 million, up 1% from a year earlier, and beating the average estimate of 430.5 million. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.86% from 1.91% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 46.6% from 45.4%. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting a couple of data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In August, fintech platform Adyen made Fastlane available to businesses in the U.S., and said it plans to expand the offering globally in the future. The company also partnered with other leaders in global commerce including Fiserv, Amazon, Global Payments and Shopify as it looks to grow its share of online checkout. Fastlane targets the 60% of online payments that aren't using a branded payment option, in the hope that a customer will graduate from guest checkout and convert to becoming a PayPal user. The other big product launch during the quarter was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. Thus far, PayPal has seen 1 million new PayPal debit card enrollments. "All of this is driving back branded checkout growth," Chriss said Tuesday in an earnings call. Venmo's total payment volume rose 8% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss says the two primary monetization levers are the Venmo debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. "With these product improvements in place, we're now leaning into marketing for Venmo for the first time in years," Chriss said.

It helps streamline the purchasing process and boost the customer experience. However, WordPress doesn’t offer order form features by default. You’ll need an eCommerce plugin to get them. At WPBeginner, we were already using WPForms for our contact forms and realized that it could also be used to create online order forms. So, we further investigated our favorite form builder alongside other popular order form tools to share a list of the best options with you. Each plugin has unique features that cater to different types of businesses. Whether you’re selling products, services, or digital downloads, there’s a solution for you. Now, let’s go over some of the best order form plugins for WordPress! Are you in a hurry? Here’s a quick look at all the online order form plugins we’ll discuss in this article: When we looked at online order form plugins, we considered several important factors to ensure we were able to recommend the best options. Here’s how we tested and reviewed these plugins: Considering all these factors, we aim to provide honest and helpful reviews that will help you choose the best order form plugin for WordPress. At WPBeginner, we have over 16 years of experience in WordPress, eCommerce, online marketing, and more. We tap into this collective knowledge when writing these informative articles. Plus, our professional team of WordPress web designers and developers has helped many clients build eCommerce stores with online order forms. We also carefully evaluate every plugin and tool featured on our blog, testing them on actual websites to ensure they meet our standards. For more details on this process, check out our complete editorial guidelines. Now, let’s dive into our list so you can find the best online order form for WordPress! WPForms is the best online order form builder on the market, and it’s trusted by more than 6 million websites, including us! Our hands-on experience gives us confidence in recommending this tool, as we know its strengths and limitations firsthand. To learn more about this plugin, you can read our full WPForms review. If you’re a non-tech-savvy restaurant owner or local entrepreneur, don’t worry. WPForms makes creating an online order form in WordPress easy with its drag-and-drop builder, a feature that allows you to customize forms without coding. What’s more, the plugin offers ready-made templates like the ‘Billing / Order Form,’ which includes fields for customer details. Speaking of order form templates, we were particularly impressed by the tool’s 141 ready-made templates in the ‘Order’ subcategory. In our opinion, this shows WPForms’ commitment to user-friendliness, especially with specific forms for takeout orders, t-shirt sales, and various service bookings. For more information, feel free to check out our guide on how to make an online order form. When it comes to eCommerce integration, WPForms goes the extra mile. Whether you’re offering memberships, online courses, or digital products, it works really well with 12 powerful eCommerce tools. They include WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, Shopify, and MemberPress. If you want, you can also integrate WPForms with Constant Contact for email marketing automation and Advanced Coupons to manage discount codes and promotions. On top of that, you can connect it to payment processors like PayPal and Stripe. This allows customers to pay directly through the form, making it easy to manage orders and payments for your business. For more details, you might want to see our guide on how to create a WordPress form with payment options. Another great feature that WPForms offers is customizable email notifications. These let you alert your team of new orders and send automatic receipts to customers for confirmation. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WPForms plugin: WPForms is the best online form builder with over 2000 templates, flexible customization, and built-in spam protection. It also has advanced features like automated workflows. Pricing: WPForms lets you start for free with WPForms Lite, which includes basic templates and integrations. To access more features, you will need to upgrade to the premium version starting at $39.60 per year. If you want to sell just one product on your site, then you don’t need a full-fledged online store or a fancy shopping cart. Instead, you can create a simple order form for customers to fill out. WP Simple Pay, a top Stripe plugin for WordPress, lets you set all this up. Feel free to get more information about the platform in our complete WP Simple Pay review. Unlike many Stripe plugins, WP Simple Pay doesn’t charge an extra 3% fee on transactions, which we think is a huge plus! Also, while it has a strong reputation for its integration with Stripe, it also supports more than 10 payment gateways. After installing, you’ll follow a simple setup wizard to connect your Stripe account. You’ll then easily find a template to fit your needs. This lets you create a form that matches your business without starting from scratch. Then, we found WP Simple Pay’s Stripe automatic tax calculation to be very handy. It’s based on where your customers are, which helps you save time and stay compliant so you can focus more on your business. When it comes to inventory management, this plugin also makes it easy. During our research, we discovered that WP Simple Pay automatically shows or hides forms based on stock levels, which helps you maintain customer trust by preventing sales of out-of-stock items. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the WP Simple Pay plugin: Based on our findings, WP Simple Pay’s user-friendly templates, automatic features, and easy integration with Stripe make it a great choice for anyone looking to sell products online. That said, it can also be a streamlined option if you only want to sell a single product. Pricing: Stripe Payment Forms by WP Simple Pay offers a free option, but it charges a 3% transaction fee. To remove this fee and unlock more features, you can upgrade to a premium plan starting at $49.50 per year for the Personal plan. Formidable Forms, in general, is a great choice for creating advanced forms like quizzes, calculators, and custom designs. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it’s also great for building online order forms, which is why we included it on our list. We have tested it thoroughly to learn about all its features. You can learn more in our complete review of Formidable Forms. During setup, we found that Formidable Forms offers 16 online order form templates for creating simple payment forms. Then, it lets users collect payments through popular gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and Authorize.net. When creating the order form, you might want to include a ‘Summary’ field. We like how it provides an automatic overview of the order, which can help boost user experience. Plus, we appreciate Formidable Forms’ compatibility with WooCommerce. It also supports extra integrations with Zapier and Mailchimp. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Formidable Forms plugin: Overall, Formidable Forms is a great tool for creating professional online order forms. The automatic order summary feature significantly enhances the user experience. Plus, its compatibility with WooCommerce opens up even more eCommerce possibilities. Pricing: Formidable Forms Lite is free and lets you create unlimited forms. For advanced features like lead collection, you’ll need a premium plan, which starts at $39.50 per year. It’s a solid choice for those on a budget who need professional online forms for their small business or blog. Ninja Forms is one of the best plugins for handling complex calculations, making it perfect for managing online orders. It also integrates with many different CRM platforms, so it’s ideal for customer management. While we don’t use it on our site, we have researched and tested this plugin to see if it lives up to its reputation. For more details, you can read our complete Ninja Forms review. When exploring its features, we were surprised to find only 2 ready-made form templates for accepting online payments. Even though it can be more time-consuming, there’s also a blank canvas option to create your online order form from scratch. The good news is that we discovered that you can activate various payment add-ons for PayPal, Stripe, Authorize.net, and Elavon. Then, depending on your chosen gateway, you can also offer options like ‘buy now, pay later‘ and accept payments through popular services like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Venmo. When it comes to simplifying your workflow, Ninja Forms offers automation integrations with Webhooks and Zapier. We also found that it excels in CRM platform integration, allowing you to manage customer data effectively. Based on our findings, it looks like Ninja Forms works well with Salesforce CRM, HubSpot CRM, Zoho CRM, and more. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Ninja Forms plugins: Our overall impression was that Ninja Forms is a solid choice for anyone looking to streamline their online order process. It has flexible payment options and works great with different CRM platforms. Plus, its automation features with Webhooks and Zapier make it super easy to manage customer data. Pricing: You can download the free Ninja Forms plugin from WordPress, which is ideal for multiple websites. The pro plan starts at $99 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions, plus access to more add-ons and integrations with popular email services like ConvertKit and Constant Contact. Like Formidable Forms, Gravity Forms is a popular choice for building complex WordPress order forms. However, the main difference is that Gravity Forms has a much higher number of CRM integrations for managing customer data. Although we don’t use it on our website, we downloaded and thoroughly tested Gravity Forms to check if it deserves the hype. Here’s our full Gravity Forms review if you want to learn more about this plugin. During setup, we found 3 pre-made templates you can use to create an online order form. They are ‘Ecommerce PayPal Form Template,’ ‘Ecommerce Stripe Form Template,’ and ‘Ecommerce Form Template.’ Gravity Forms works with popular payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and Mollie. With its Payment add-ons, you can sell digital downloads or physical products easily. We also discovered that you can handle one-time and recurring payments. When testing Gravity Forms, one feature that stood out was its ‘Dynamic Population’ field. This lets customers pre-fill fields like a phone number or email if they already have that info. It makes filling out forms easier and helps reduce the chances of people abandoning their orders. Now, do note that Gravity Forms’ Pro plan costs $159 a year, and it includes eCommerce add-ons you might need for all these to work. If you’re already using CRMs like Zoho or Capsule, this plan has just what you need to keep things running smoothly. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Gravity Forms plugin: Overall, Gravity Forms is a powerful choice for managing payments and making it easier for customers to shop on your WordPress site. Pricing: Gravity Forms is a premium plugin that doesn’t offer a free version or trial, but you can try it through an online demo. It has three pricing plans designed for various business needs. The ‘Basic’ plan costs $59 per year, allowing unlimited forms and submissions. For a completely free order order form plugin, Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce could be your best bet. This plugin is exclusive to WooCommerce users only. So if you’re not using the platform, then this tool won’t work for you. We also don’t use it on our blog or brand websites. But we tested it extensively to see all its features, and we believe it’s a great option for adding an online order form to a WooCommerce store. During testing, we learned that Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce allows you to set up bulk order forms using a simple questionnaire: In this section, you can set the maximum number of items for customers to bulk order. Then, if there are products you don’t want to be available for bulk orders, you can easily exclude these products using their IDs. What’s more, you can also display specific product categories that are relevant for bulk ordering. We really like these features, as they help prevent lost profits. There’s also an Ajax-based product search to help users find what they need faster. If you want, you can display or hide the price on the bulk order form. When it comes to embedding the bulk order form, just use the shortcode [wcbulkorder] on a WordPress page, and you’re good to go. Pros: Cons: Why we chose the Quick/Bulk Order Form for WooCommerce plugin: After testing this plugin, we think it’s a great free option for WooCommerce users wanting to simplify their ordering process. You can tailor forms and exclude specific products to maximize profits. Pricing: Free to download and use from the WordPress plugin directory. When it comes to online order forms, our top choices are WPForms, WP Simple Pay, and Formidable Forms. WPForms is hands-down the best form builder we’ve used on WPBeginner. It’s user-friendly and offers 141 ready-made order form templates. Also, it integrates smoothly with 12 eCommerce tools, such as WooCommerce and Shopify, and supports payment processors like PayPal and Stripe. Plus, customizable email notifications help keep everyone updated. If you’re looking to sell just one product, WP Simple Pay is a fantastic option. It lets you create simple order forms without a full online store and doesn’t charge an extra 3% transaction fee. The plugin also automatically calculates taxes based on customer location and manages inventory by showing or hiding forms as needed. Lastly, Formidable Forms is ideal for advanced users. It provides 16 order form templates and supports popular payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe. Its automatic order summary feature enhances the user experience, and compatibility with WooCommerce expands your eCommerce options.
