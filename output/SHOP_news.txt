Here's how the company did compared with Wall Street estimates, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: For the first quarter, PayPal expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.17, which is higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.13. Earnings for the year will come in at $4.95 to $5.10 a share, topping the $4.90 average estimate, according to LSEG. PayPal also announced a new $15 billion share buyback program, and expects to make around $6 billion in repurchases in 2025. Revenue increased about 4% in the quarter from $8.03 billion a year ago. Total payment volume, an indication of how digital payments are faring in the broader economy, was just short of estimates, coming in at $437.8 billion for the fourth quarter, versus the $438.2 billion analysts projected. While PayPal's take rate slipped to 1.91% from 1.96% a year earlier, transaction margin, which is how the company gauges the profitability of its core business, rose to 47% from 45.8%. In 2024, transaction margin dollars grew 7% to $14.7 billion, bolstered by Braintree, a service Meta uses for credit-card processing. The company said it anticipates growth of 4% to 5% in transaction margin dollars in 2025 to $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion PayPal's stock is up 43% in the past year, as of Monday's close. CEO Alex Chriss, who joined the company in September 2023, is trying to revive growth at PayPal, which had been been mired in a deep slump due to increased competition and a declining take rate, or the percentage of revenue PayPal keeps from each transaction. Chriss has focused on prioritizing profitable growth and better monetizing key acquisitions like Braintree and payments app Venmo. Venmo's total payment volume rose 10% in the quarter from a year earlier. DoorDash, Starbucks and Ticketmaster are among businesses now accepting Venmo as one way that consumers can pay. In the short term, Chriss has said the two primary monetization levers are Venmo's debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance both online and offline, and Pay With Venmo, which provides a seamless way for customers to pay online. Monthly active accounts for the debit card grew more than 30% in 2024, and Pay with Venmo monthly actives increased more than 20%. The company added 8.8 million active accounts last year. One of Chriss' strategies to address the deteriorating margin was to offer merchants increased value-added services, such as connecting data points at checkout to drive down the rate of cart abandonment. That product, dubbed Fastlane, launched in August, and is a one-click payment option for online sales that can go head-to-head with Apple Pay and Shop Pay by Shopify. In 2024, branded checkout volume rose more than 6%, thanks in part to strength across large enterprise platforms. The other big product launch in 2024 was PayPal Everywhere, which went live in early September. The initiative offers 5% cash back for using a PayPal debit card within the mobile app. "The improvements we made to branded checkout, peer-to-peer, and Venmo, plus the progress we made on our price-to-value strategy, are beginning to show up in our results," Chriss said in the earnings statement. The company will hold an earnings call at 8:00 A.M. Eastern time. WATCH: PayPal's crypto lead on allowing merchants to buy and sell virtual assets Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Integrations: From Simple Data Transfer To Modern Composable Architectures

Through YouTube, Twitch, and … More about Edoardo ↬ Weekly tips on front-end & UX.Trusted by 200,000+ folks. This article has been kindly supported by our dear friends at Storyblok, a friendly headless CMS with a visual editor, nested components and customizable content blocks for websites and apps. Thank you! When computers first started talking to each other, the methods were remarkably simple. In the early days of the Internet, systems exchanged files via FTP or communicated via raw TCP/IP sockets. This direct approach worked well for simple use cases but quickly showed its limitations as applications grew more complex. The real breakthrough in enabling complex communication between computers on a network came with the introduction of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) in the 1980s. RPC allowed developers to call procedures on remote systems as if they were local functions, abstracting away the complexity of network communication. This pattern laid the foundation for many of the modern integration approaches we use today. Here’s a simplified example using Python’s XML-RPC. RPC can operate in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous modes. Modern implementations such as gRPC support streaming and bi-directional communication. In the example below, we define a gRPC service called Calculator with two RPC methods, Calculate, which takes a Numbers message and returns a Result message, and CalculateStream, which sends a stream of Result messages in response. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) became the standard for enterprise integration, introducing a more structured approach to system communication. While SOAP provided robust enterprise features, its complexity, and verbosity led to the development of simpler alternatives, especially the REST APIs that dominate Web services communication today. But REST is not alone. Let’s have a look at some modern integration patterns. REST (Representational State Transfer) has become the de facto standard for Web APIs, providing a simple, stateless approach to manipulating resources. Its simplicity and HTTP-based nature make it ideal for web applications. First defined by Roy Fielding in 2000 as an architectural style on top of the Web’s standard protocols, its constraints align perfectly with the goals of the modern Web, such as performance, scalability, reliability, and visibility: client and server separated by an interface and loosely coupled, stateless communication, cacheable responses. In modern applications, the most common implementations of the REST protocol are based on the JSON format, which is used to encode messages for requests and responses. GraphQL emerged from Facebook’s internal development needs in 2012 before being open-sourced in 2015. Born out of the challenges of building complex mobile applications, it addressed limitations in traditional REST APIs, particularly the issues of over-fetching and under-fetching data. At its core, GraphQL is a query language and runtime that provides a type system and declarative data fetching, allowing the client to specify exactly what it wants to fetch from the server. Often used to build complex UIs with nested data structures, mobile applications, or microservices architectures, it has proven effective at handling complex data requirements at scale and offers a growing ecosystem of tools. Modern applications often require real-time updates. For example, e-commerce apps need to update inventory levels when a purchase is made, or content management apps need to refresh cached content when a document is edited. Traditional request-response models can struggle to meet these demands because they rely on clients’ polling servers for updates, which is inefficient and resource-intensive. Webhooks and event-driven architectures address these needs more effectively. Webhooks let servers send real-time notifications to clients or other systems when specific events happen. This reduces the need for continuous polling. Event-driven architectures go further by decoupling application components. Services can publish and subscribe to events asynchronously, and this makes the system more scalable, responsive, and simpler. This is a simple Node.js function that uses Fastify to set up a web server. It responds to the endpoint /webhook, checks the type field of the JSON request, and refreshes a cache if the event is of type content.published. With all this background information and technical knowledge, it’s easier to picture the current state of web application development, where a single, monolithic app is no longer the answer to business needs, but a new paradigm has emerged: Composable Architecture. This evolution has led us to the concept of composable architecture, where applications are built by combining specialized services. This is where headless CMS solutions have a clear advantage, serving as the perfect example of how modern integration patterns come together. Headless CMS platforms separate content management from content presentation, allowing you to build specialized frontends relying on a fully-featured content backend. This decoupling facilitates content reuse, independent scaling, and the flexibility to use a dedicated technology or service for each part of the system. Take Storyblok as an example. Storyblok is a headless CMS designed to help developers build flexible, scalable, and composable applications. Content is exposed via API, REST, or GraphQL; it offers a long list of events that can trigger a webhook. Editors are happy with a great Visual Editor, where they can see changes in real time, and many integrations are available out-of-the-box via a marketplace. Imagine this ContentDeliveryService in your app, where you can interact with Storyblok’s REST API using the open source JS Client: The last piece of the puzzle is a real example of integration. Again, many are already available in the Storyblok marketplace, and you can easily control them from the dashboard. However, to fully leverage the Composable Architecture, we can use the most powerful tool in the developer’s hand: code. Let’s imagine a modern e-commerce platform that uses Storyblok as its content hub, Shopify for inventory and orders, Algolia for product search, and Stripe for payments. Once each account is set up and we have our access tokens, we could quickly build a front-end page for our store. This isn’t production-ready code, but just to get a quick idea, let’s use React to build the page for a single product that integrates our services. First, we should initialize our clients: Given that we created a blok in Storyblok that holds product information such as the product_id, we could write a component that takes the productSlug, fetches the product content from Storyblok, the inventory data from Shopify, and some related products from the Algolia index: We could then set a simple component state: And return a template with all our data: We could then use an event-driven approach and create a server that listens to our shop events and processes the checkout with Stripe (credits to Manuel Spigolon for this tutorial): And with this approach, each service is independent of the others, which helps us achieve our business goals (performance, scalability, flexibility) with a good developer experience and a smaller and simpler application that’s easier to maintain. The integration between headless CMSs and modern web services represents the current and future state of high-performance web applications. By using specialized, decoupled services, developers can focus on business logic and user experience. A composable ecosystem is not only modular but also resilient to the evolving needs of the modern enterprise. These integrations highlight the importance of mastering API-driven architectures and understanding how different tools can harmoniously fit into a larger tech stack. In today’s digital landscape, success lies in choosing tools that offer flexibility and efficiency, adapt to evolving demands, and create applications that are future-proof against the challenges of tomorrow.
