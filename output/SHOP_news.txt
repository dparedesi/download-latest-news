Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response.

Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing. Note: You can’t predict exactly what your customers will ask, and there are infinite ways they can do it. But thinking about prompts — not just keywords — will put you in a good place to be able to optimize your ecommerce pages for LLMs. Think in layers: This is how you start to think of your items like answers and solutions, not just products. Let this prompt structure inform your: LLMs can pull from all of it — so make sure you’re using the kind of language your real customers use everywhere. Even if your site is crawlable, your schema is perfect, and your feed is super optimized — LLMs still learn about your brand based on what people are saying about you elsewhere. They’re trained on massive web-scale datasets, so third-party content — like reviews, Reddit mentions, YouTube transcripts, forums, blog posts — can carry as much (or more) weight than your owned channels. If you want to show up in AI answers, your brand needs to already exist in the wider conversation. AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude all lean on third-party review sites and forums in their answers to brand and product-related queries. These are the places you’ll want to show up in order to be included in those answers: Showing up in these places is half the battle. The other component is how you show up. Ideally, you’ll want to be mentioned alongside competitors (“like Brooklinen but…”). And in the right, relevant context (“these are some of the best cooling sheets for eczema”). A lot of this is going to be completely out of your control (especially on platforms like Reddit). But good marketing practices can make it more likely that people will naturally talk about your brand in the way you want them to. Gaining LLM visibility is a byproduct of an effective multichannel marketing strategy. If you’re running a strong content program, building brand awareness, and actively participating in your category — you’re already seeding relevance. What’s new is the urgency: LLMs are already using these signals to decide which brands deserve to be recommended. Related: See our LLM Seeding Playbook for tactics, templates, and outreach strategies. In traditional SEO, visibility was deterministic: rank #1 for a keyword, get X% of clicks. That model is breaking. AI-powered discovery works differently. Your brand might appear in one version of a response, but not the next. Whether your ecommerce store is included depends on how the user phrases their prompt, how much brand recognition you have, and how often you’re referenced across the web. So, your measurement strategy needs to adapt. Start by building a prompt library — real questions your customers might ask: Here’s how it looks in Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit: For each prompt, ask: Over time, this gives you a clearer picture of how visible your brand is across different use cases. AI-driven search is already reshaping how people discover products. The shift is subtle now, but it won’t stay that way for long. What used to be a clear SEO vs. paid search strategy is now blending into a broader question: When someone asks a smart machine what to buy… will it know you exist? This guide gave you a playbook to start answering that question: It’s a lot. But the good news? If you’ve already invested in great products, strong messaging, and a multi-channel strategy, you’re not starting from scratch. Still need help nailing the fundamentals?
