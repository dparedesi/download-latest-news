Consumer brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma see major growth opportunities in the newfound elevation of streetwear. All of a sudden, they’re more than just sports apparel brands—they’re nods to high fashion, open doors to what’s cool. These brands also know “sneakerheads”—people who are addicted to the chase for an exclusive item—will wait hours in front of a store for a limited-edition product. The coinciding rise of athleisure (a hybrid of gymwear and leisure clothing), and the celebrity influence on that stream of fashion, has further encouraged these consumer brands to lean into the fashion-meets-casual streetwear look. It’s contributing to a streetwear industry valued in excess of $347 billion. Streetwear is a type of casual clothing heavily influenced by popular culture. It’s an eclectic mix of apparel from New York’s hip-hop culture and California skateboarding fashion that became popular in the 1990s. Today, streetwear dominates the social media scene. This has contributed to a global streetwear industry that accounts for about 10% of the global footwear and fashion industry. Growth in the streetwear market shows no signs of slowing down. Experts predict the industry will hit a $637 billion valuation by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.89%. Why? Because customers spend big bucks on streetwear: Sneakers are the standout streetwear product, with 62% of consumers selecting footwear as the item they were most likely to buy. Other popular streetwear pieces include oversized t-shirts, hoodies, and joggers. Unlike traditional luxury retail, buying streetwear involves cultural knowledge as much as disposable income. The Streetwear Impact Report notes 70% of streetwear customers value brands’ commitment to social issues, with 59% prioritizing brand activism. Moreover, 47% indicated they would likely stop purchasing from brands with representatives who behave inappropriately. Streetwear buyers tend to be millennial or Gen Z, and have some disposable income. They’re typically working professionals who don’t have children or mortgages to worry about, and have lived most of their lives online. A report by Hypebeast confirms this: Kristen Classi-Zummo, apparel industry analyst at NPD, told Vogue Business that “Gen Z wants a bike short that they can wear to both the airport or to brunch, but they are also looking for it to keep them cool and stay in place.” Thanks to the democratization of social media, everyone will know that a cool t-shirt is expensive or a pair of headphones costs $3,000. The rise of the tech sector and fewer traditional industries employing young people has also meant smart, expressive and casual clothing is now more accepted in the workplace. Social commerce platforms like TikTok and Instagram dominate the marketing strategies of many streetwear brands for this reason. The typical user of both platforms is a Gen Z consumer who’s grown up in a hyperconnected digital world where likes are a normalized currency. Streetwear shoppers show diverse shopping habits but strongly prefer direct channels. According to Hypebeast, 53% of consumers prefer buying from physical brand stores, while 42% favor brands' own ecommerce sites. This highlights Gen Z and millennials' desire for exclusive, direct interactions rather than shopping via multi-brand retailers or social media. When you work for a streetwear company, it’s easy to get caught up in the nitty gritty details of your product. After all, you’re proud of each item, and they tend to sell out. But streetwear customers don’t always buy individual items because of their impressive specifications. People buy them to fit into streetwear culture—a lifestyle movement where dressed-down, comfortable clothing is a social status. Maniere De Voir is one streetwear brand which took this approach with a marketing campaign. Slotted between Instagram posts that showcase their products, they publish short-form videos that sell the lifestyle their target audience is looking to create. This Instagram Reel, for example, showcases interior design that’s cozy and minimalist—two adjectives that customers would use to describe the brand's image. Incorporate this into your streetwear brand marketing strategy by creating a broader identity around your clothing brand. What words would customers use to describe your streetwear items? What does their dream life look like? Angle your marketing campaigns around the answers to sell the lifestyle they want to create using your apparel. The roots of streetwear’s community culture go back to niche online forums like NikeTalk, BapeTalk, and Strictly Supreme. Although these early forums have declined, the community ethos persists on platforms like Instagram, driving brand loyalty through shared cultural connections and peer-to-peer inspiration. Tap into these communities when you’re: Streetwear brand Charlie Hustle is one retailer using the local community approach to drive consumer loyalty. Their slogan is “do good, feel good, look good”—a motto the brand helps their audience achieve through their Communi-TEES program. Consumers in the Kansas City area can donate to local charities through any purchase they make on the brand’s direct-to-consumer store. The digital-native Gen Z relies heavily on social media influence when determining which products to buy. For the majority of streetwear customers, social media is the top source of inspiration. It beats the street, word of mouth, and fashion publications. This makes sense—Gen Z’s purchasing habits are wildly different from older generations. Data compiled in the Shopper Preference Report for 2025 found that almost 80% of Gen Z and millennials use social media to make purchases. But a simple social media marketing strategy isn’t enough. Although Hypebeast found most consumers use social media as a source of information, just 31% consider a brand’s own social media presence an important factor. Plus, with platforms like TikTok enabling everyone to be a creator, fashion brands can tap into the social nature of streetwear while publishing the user-generated content their audiences trust. Shopify Collabs helps brands discover creators, influencers, and affiliates in the streetwear industry. Partner with these creators—be that through gifted products, sponsored posts, or affiliate commissions—to generate UGC through influencer marketing. This will show how your streetwear items look on real people. Streetwear brands are leaning into co-marketing opportunities as a way to stand out in a saturated market. Shopify’s Alex Danco says that "the biggest opportunity flying under the radar is collaboration. It’s the best way to increase the number of buyers who know and care about you in a way that turns you into not competitors but cooperators, perhaps even allies and friends.” Identify brands that share your audience. The best collaborations are between two brands that share overlapping brand values and customer demographics without being direct competitors. Alex adds: “Collaboration is truly the win-win way for brands to find new audiences in a way that doesn’t dilute your brands.” Sportswear-turned-streetwear label Puma takes this to the extreme with their Dua Lipa partnership. The singer, known for her casual fashion sense, launched a limited edition collection with the brand. Both parties went back and forth on Instagram to strengthen the partnership and get both customer bases excited. The sneakers element is a particularly interesting collaboration. Hypebeast reports that sneakers are the most popular streetwear product, but that this market is also one of the most saturated. As Zofia Zwieglinska, international fashion reporter at Glossy, says, “Most brands dedicate a portion of their collection to streetwear, and sneakers in particular. Tie-ins to art and music have continued—from the Nike x RTFKT partnership with Takashi Murakami to Tiffany's tie-in with Basquiat and Beyonce. “However, sneakers and streetwear have reached a saturation point—the differentiators now will be with brands that can evolve it to suit a new type of customer.” Gen Z uses social media to research brands more often than search engines, and social media is driving in-store foot traffic (and subsequent sales) for many streetwear retailers. More than half of customers say they’re most likely to buy streetwear items through a physical brand store, followed by 42% who head to the retailer’s ecommerce website—which is why 60% of retailers say flagship locations are a key part of their brand strategy. British streetwear brand Corteiz has mastered this online-to-offline marketing strategy. Their social media presence drives in-person commerce with time-sensitive product drops at key locations in London. This Instagram post, for example, encouraged followers to visit the brand’s market stall with 99p in exact change to buy their blackout cargo trousers. The stall was only open for two hours, and coordinates for the location dropped just a few hours before the event began. The viral nature of Corteiz’s in-person product drops helps build a base of die-hard fans who want in on the brand’s community. So much so, people document their attempts to locate Corteiz’s product drop locations on YouTube and TikTok—a streetwear brand marketing idea that gets customers to do the legwork of building hype around product drops. Experiment with new markets and products quickly—without the overhead. Make sales wherever your customers are with Shopify POS and mobile card readers, so you can accept payments on the spot. Learn more With customers craving experiences from the streetwear brands they interact with, the metaverse—a 3D virtual experience where customers can play, shop, and interact with other people—is quickly becoming a staple in many marketing strategies. German sneaker retailer Flowers For Society is one label centered heavily around metaverse experiences. Their first product drop, which was only available through preorder, linked every item with a unique non-fungible token (NFT). Customers gained access to the brand’s own metaverse community, unlocking exclusive access to future product drops, limited edition apparel, and exclusive collaborations. Sell NFTs on your streetwear store with Shopify. Give customers exclusive access to products, collections, and discounts, and sync your store with community engagement channels like Discord—all in one place. Exclusivity is an important element for streetwear fans. Zofia from Glossy says, “Digital-native brands need to focus on how streetwear customers interpret value differently to their other customers. Aspects like rarity, collectability, and wider cultural value matter more to these customers, as well as engagement with the brand community.” Two-thirds of streetwear brands surveyed by Hypebeast described the drop model as important to their business. It capitalizes on rarity, collectability, and cultural value by making streetwear products time- or quantity-limited. Streetwear brand Live Fast Die Young uses the drops model to fuel their social media campaigns. On Instagram, the retailer regularly teases new product drops, such as their new 54-piece collection. Customers flock to the comment section to express their anticipation. Maksim Telkov, ecommerce manager at Live Fast Die Young, adds: “With our product drop strategy, we always had problems with over ordering or that payments didn't go through. With Shopify, these issues were resolved all at once.” Use Shopify’s preordering functionality to create product pages and capture leads before the product goes on sale. You’ll be able to take full, partial, or no payment from customers and set expectations on when the item will be delivered. If they don’t buy this time, an automated email marketing series can convert subscribers into paying customers. Email your subscribers when the product drops—a surefire way to get their attention, rather than relying on a social media post which might get buried in a crowded feed. Sustainability is more than a buzzword for modern consumers—McKinsey reports that two in three customers think sustainability is an important factor when buying apparel. Customers have the same approach to sustainability when purchasing streetwear. The majority of consumers said social issues were important to them, with brand activism playing a role in the clothing brands consumers choose to connect with. Coney Island Picnic cofounder and creative director Ryan Wood says the brand prioritized sustainability in their mission to keep up with consumer preferences: “About a year ago, our brand made the conscious decision to shift the manufacturing of all tees and fleece to be sourced from organic cotton without raising the price for customers.” This commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted across every aspect of the brand’s marketing strategy. Coney Island Picnic displays a “sustainable” category in their ecommerce navigation, produces short-form TikTok videos to explain their brand mission, and highlights how products are made using organic cotton within product descriptions. Ryan says: “As we know, the fast fashion industry's current trajectory will not sustain much longer, and many consumers want to avoid being a part of the wasteful cycle. Therefore, more consumers are taking note of sustainable retailers they can trust and becoming repeat customers.” If you’re not in a position to make your products more sustainable, don’t try to pull the wool over your customers’ eyes. Greenwashing—the term people use to describe clothing brands that exaggerate their role in making their business more sustainable—doesn’t fly with Gen Z customers. You can make small changes to prove your streetwear brand is moving in the right direction without overhauling your entire logistics strategy or supply chain. The Shopify Planet app, for example, makes a small contribution to the Shopify Sustainability Fund. This fund is used to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and make shipping carbon-neutral. Gen Z has had to thrive in difficult economic conditions. They report higher rates of anxiety, depression, and distress than any other demographic, often turning to nostalgia as a temporary escape from normal life. Business Insider reports the nostalgia trend is being driven by this generation. In the article, Krystine Batcho, professor and psychologist at Le Moyne College, says, “For many people, particularly young adults or those without a financial safety net, poor economic conditions raise fears of being able to meet financial obligations like rent or student-debt payments.” Related hashtags like #nostalgia and #Y2K are both thriving on TikTok, having each amassed billions of views. Streetwear brands are tapping into this nostalgia to connect with Gen Z consumers. Mauv Studio, for example, launched an entire brand that reflected the Y2K aesthetic. Experiential drops amplify streetwear’s exclusivity. Supreme and luxury brands like Dior and Burberry have adopted the drops model, limiting product availability to enhance desirability. Hypebeast notes that 66% of streetwear industry respondents view the drops model as core to their strategy. Corteiz created significant buzz with their DA GREAT DENIM EXCHANGE popup event in Brooklyn. Founder Clint Ogbenna, known simply as "Clint," announced the event just 24 hours in advance on Instagram. Folks came down to exchange jeans from popular brands (Levi’s, True Religion, Carhartt, etc.) right off their bodies for a free pair of Corteiz denim. The tactic was covered by outlets like GQ and earned hundreds of thousands of views on social media, a massive win for Corteiz. Clint himself appeared at the event, personally interacting with attendees and handing out individually numbered dollar bills as tickets. The traded-in jeans were later donated to youth charities, adding a social-impact dimension. New York-based brand Supreme is highly regarded for its influence on streetwear culture. What started as a Manhattan skateboarding store turned into a business acquired for $2.1 billion by VF, the parent company of VANS. Every new product is associated with a time-sensitive drop only available at one of their 11 retail stores. But you need an invite to get there, and a one-purchase per person limit applies. Only customers on Supreme’s mailing list get the “golden ticket”—an invitation to join the hundreds of people that queue around the block to get their hands on a Supreme drop. And if they want more than one piece, they’ll need to bring a friend. The founder of iconic streetwear brand A Bathing Ape (BAPE), Japanese artist Nigo, intentionally made a limited amount of merchandise when he started out in the early 1990s because he knew the desire for exclusivity would help his brand grow. HighSnobiety reports that “Nigo started out on a tight budget and could only afford to produce around 50 T-shirts a week—but he also disliked the idea of everyone wearing the same thing.” Alongside their drop model, BAPE got celebrities to wear their products to build hype and create the social symbol many streetwear customers aspire to. Hip-hop stars like The Notorious B.I.G and Pharrell sported BAPE products, with Soulja Boy even rapping the words “I got me some Bathing Ape” in his 3x Platinum hitCrank That. Australian streetwear retailer Culture Kings is known for its shopping experience. Instead of allowing shoppers to passively browse items, their stores are a true community experience. The non-shopping activities on offer include: Culture Kings turned to Shopify with a goal to mimic these in-store experiences for global shoppers online. They customized their storefront to display tailored, dynamic product listings with a “Shop the Look” page. Anyone viewing the brand’s social media content could easily shop the latest products through this landing page. Simon Beard, cofounder of Culture Kings, said: “Shopify—what it really did is allow us to more focus on our art side rather than being so bogged down in the science side, which was not our forte. It really enabled us to scale, knowing that we had this platform that delivered, that can grow with us.” Off-White differentiates itself from other streetwear players by bridging the gap between luxury brands and pop culture. Their founder and former artistic director of Louis Vuitton, the late Virgil Abloh, started the company in 2012 under the original name Pyrex Vision. According to Front Office Sports, Off-White came to life as a result of Abloh’s 3% approach—the idea that a new design could be created with just a 3% difference. Part of this differentiation includes irony—a sense of humor Gen Z consumers can bond over. Many of Off-White’s streetwear products obviously state the use case in quotation marks, like this windbreaker coat with the word “water” splashed across the back. Princess Polly, an established streetwear company located in Australia, took a unique approach with their marketing strategy. Alongside becoming a staple in their Gen Z customers’ shopping routine, the streetwear brand wanted to deliver a seamless experience long after the first purchase. Alexandria Collis, director of operations at Princess Polly, says, "We're always looking for ways to create less pressure points for customers. Making returns difficult shouldn't be the goal—there's actually a real opportunity to create loyalty through the return experience." The first stage was Princess Polly’s migration from Magento to Shopify. They then enlisted the help of Shopify Technology Partner Loop to access measurable returns insights and allow customers to exchange items, rather than request a refund. The result? Princess Polly saw a 55% reduction in out-of-stock rates with their new instant exchange function. Alexandria Collis adds: "Thanks to Shopify and Loop, we’ve seen a huge improvement in our return experience, with customers telling us firsthand that they appreciate how easy it is. And not only is it improving our customer loyalty—it's also driving a significant uptick in revenue." Kyle Ng, founder of the streetwear brand Brain Dead, is redefining streetwear culture through a maximalist, community-focused approach. Kyle is building an expansive lifestyle around eclectic interests, hosting hardcore music festivals, running a movie theater (Brain Dead Studios), organizing Magic: The Gathering tournaments, and collaborating creatively with figures like Jeff Goldblum, Seth Rogen, and Freddie Gibbs. Brain Dead has also branched out, notably reviving avant-garde Oakley shoe designs from the 1990s. Kyle actively avoids mainstream, predictable brand collaborations, instead choosing projects driven by genuine personal interests and niche subcultures, like vegan burgers or indigenous artisan-made Minion products featuring the familiar characters from the Despicable Me franchise. In September 2021, luxury fashion brand Balenciaga took fashion marketing to a new level by partnering with Fortnite, one of the most popular video games globally with over one million players at any given moment. Balenciaga designed digital outfits, known as “skins,” that players could buy within the Fortnite in-game store. The skins were inspired by real-life garments that incorporated Fortnite’s cartoon-like aesthetic. The campaign was the first of its kind to merge digital and real-life experiences. It targeted Fortnite’s Gen Z user base and made the Balenciaga brand relevant and culturally significant to a new generation. Streetwear is a competitive branch of the fashion industry. Brands who stand out don’t just sell products—they create communities around their products, selling the complete lifestyle and status symbol. Use these streetwear marketing strategies to meet customers where they are. From inducing scarcity with product drops to experimenting with the metaverse, do it all with Shopify's all-in-one ecommerce platform for scaling stores. You can promote your streetwear brand by launching limited product drops, documenting your production process on TikTok, proving your commitment to sustainability, blending online and offline experiences, and collaborating with streetwear creators. To stand out, a streetwear brand should partner with content creators, sell a lifestyle instead of just products, back up sustainability claims, tap into nostalgia, and use experiential retail to build deeper connections with consumers. Gen Z are the largest demographic for streetwear, making up 70% of all customers. They are typically working professionals who are active on social media and have disposable income to spend on fashion.

Title: The ultimate ecommerce website launch checklist

The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog May 30, 2025 Launching a high-performing ecommerce site requires precision, collaboration, and attention to detail — especially for established businesses managing complex operations. So how do you know when you’re ready for your ecommerce website launch? You make a checklist. Whether you’re expanding into new markets, replatforming for scalability, or even starting your online business, a structured launch process minimizes risk and ensures your shop is optimized from day one. This comprehensive ecommerce website launch checklist will keep you from getting that, “What did I forget?” feeling. Let’s get into the list. The very first thing on your ecommerce launch checklist should be making sure you’re using the best ecommerce platform. Proprietary ecommerce platforms spend a lot of money to attract and persuade decision makers, but that doesn’t mean they’re the best option. What is a proprietary platform? It’s one where the company that develops and manages the platform controls the code. It requires you to host your site with their hosting services, and if you accidentally violate one of their terms of service, they can permanently remove your store from their platform without giving you a reason why. Before committing to any platform, read their terms of service closely. Some require that you grant them royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted license to everything you upload to their service (including using those materials to train their AI systems). Proprietary ecommerce platforms include Shopify, Wix, and BigCommerce (and there are others). When you sign up with one of these companies, your organizations become subject to many more restrictions than if you build your ecommerce business around an open source solution. If you like all of the bureaucracy and red tape that come with big companies, you’ll love these proprietary platforms. But if you’re planning to create an ecommerce store that you can retain maximum control over and that can affordably grow with your business over time, an open source ecommerce platform like WooCommerce (which powers over 43% of all ecommerce websites) is the better choice. Open source solutions don’t have software-specific restrictions on your products or content, they offer you the freedom to be able to extend and customize your ecommerce store more easily, and don’t require that you sign a contract granting them use of your intellectual property. More importantly, an open-source platform allows you to pick and choose the services and tools you invest in without forcing you to sign up for a plan and pay for more than you need. We’ve got a more in-depth article about why you should choose an open source ecommerce platform, if you want to dive deeper on that topic. But regardless of the solution you choose, make sure that it aligns with your capabilities, business model, marketing plan, goals, and values. Your choice of web host can significantly impact your store’s performance, user experience, and ultimately, your ecommerce success. If you’ve chosen a proprietary ecommerce platform — like a Shopify store — that takes care of hosting for you, your only option for improving your hosting quality will be to upgrade your subscription tier. However, if you’re using WordPress with an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce, you can select any web hosting provider that suits your needs. There are a lot of different types of web hosting out there — shared hosting, VPS, cloud hosting, managed hosting, etc. — so if you’re not sure which type of hosting to choose, read our detailed guide to choosing the right WooCommerce web host. Our TL;DR of hosting: Why not choose a host that’s built for WooCommerce, allowing for easy scalability and dedicated support? At Automattic, Woo’s parent company, we have three hosting providers: Regardless of the exact hosting type you decide on, make sure your ecommerce website is hosted with a provider that can accommodate your store’s needs today and into the future. Make sure you can answer the following questions: Estimate the amount of traffic you expect. A new online business might not need the same resources as an established one with thousands of daily visitors. But even a site with fewer visitors may need robust server resources due to intensive software and processes that are triggered by visitor activity on the site (e.g. forums or online courses). It’s always better to overestimate than underestimate your resource needs and ensure that your host can handle peak traffic and user activity expectations. Your hosting needs will grow as your business expands. Choose a host that can easily scale with your ecommerce store. Some hosts offer autoscaling for occasional surges in site traffic. Autoscaling provides increased bandwidth so that a spike in visitors due to a viral social media post, flash sale, or hacking attempt doesn’t bring down your site. Some hosts offer managed WordPress hosting that’s optimized especially for ecommerce platforms like WooCommerce. If you’re building a WooCommerce store, you may want to consider a host that has a good deal of experience hosting WooCommerce sites. Fast load times are crucial for ecommerce stores. Look for hosts that use SSD storage, content delivery networks (CDNs), server-side caching, and other performance optimizations. Keep in mind that shared hosting can be slower than VPS or dedicated servers because you share the server with other websites. This might not be an issue for a small to medium-sized store, but growing ecommerce websites will benefit from the additional resources that VPS and dedicated hosting can provide. Downtime can lead to lost sales, and hosting companies know this. That’s why the industry standard in uptime is 99.99%. If your host does not offer an uptime guarantee or have a track record of performing at, near, or above that 99.9% standard — steer clear. The only thing better than 99.99%? Pressable offers WordPress-specific hosting with a 100% uptime guarantee. Online stores handle sensitive customer data and all stores should be compliant with rules set by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Look for a host that is a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider and provides security features like SSL certificates, firewalls, and DDoS protection. Reliable support is essential, even if you’re a technical expert. Some website issues can only be handled by your host’s support staff (like server outages and account issues) and if those issues are causing downtime on your site, it can dramatically affect your ecommerce business or your agency’s reputation. Look for hosts that offer 24/7 customer support via multiple channels. A user-friendly control panel can make managing your site much easier. Many hosts offer cPanel or Plesk for managing your site’s files and database. If you choose a managed WordPress hosting plan, your host will have their own custom-built admin interface that you will use to manage your website. Regular backups are an absolute must to protect your site against data loss if someone hacks it or you accidentally delete important content. Make sure your host provides automatic backups and an easy method of restoring those backups to your live site. However, relying on your host alone leaves a massive gap in your security and recovery options. You also need your own real-time, off-site backup system so you can always get back online right away — even if your site is completely down or the problem stems from your host. Consider Jetpack VaultPress Backup for a best-in-class solution. When prospective customers visit your online store, you want your web pages to make a statement. Your store should get their attention, demonstrate professionalism, and show that your products are top-notch. Here are a few important ecommerce web design considerations: Which online store would you rather shop at? One with a domain name of best-dog-clothes-2.angelfire.lycos.com or one called woofandwiggle.com? We’re betting it’s the second choice. Long, non-branded urls feel inherently untrustworthy. They can also cause brand confusion. Can you really be sure you’re on the right website when the domain name doesn’t match the name of the company? An important part of branding is making sure your customers know it’s you, and not an imposter or phishing scheme, when they visit your site. Struggling to come up with the right custom domain name? Check out our article on how to choose a domain name for some guidance. A consistent brand helps potential customers know they’re in the right place. Look through every page of your website for consistent logo usage, fonts, colors, image aesthetics, and layout styles. Make sure you check hover colors and effects for links and buttons to make sure they align with your branding. You should also ensure that the display of any blocks, pages, or elements that may be managed by other extensions match your brand identity, as those sometimes come with their own default styles. Online shopping doesn’t allow customers to feel, touch, or see your products in person. Make sure that you showcase your products from all angles and take close-ups of any unique product details. Even thoughtfully-designed product pages can be quickly devalued by poor photos and video content. Your images and videos should be high-quality, with good lighting, and provide accurate representations of color. User-generated images and videos on your product pages can also be a great way to build brand trust. These don’t have to be as high quality — they just need to be informative, from verified customers, and if they are funny or feature dogs, cats, or a banana for scale, even better! Many devices have retina display screens, which have a higher density of pixels and make content look crisper. If you’re serving up lower resolution images, they may look fuzzy on a 4k monitor or a smartphone. To make sure your images are optimized for display on higher-resolution devices, you can add a retina version that’s exactly two times the size of the original. Many themes include a way to do this or you can use a plugin like Perfect Images. Not only should your images look good across desktop and mobile devices, it should also use a responsive layout that can automatically adjust to the type of device the site is being displayed on. For example, horizontal navigation menus on a desktop display should collapse to a small hamburger-style menu on mobile. Columns of content distributed horizontally across the screen on a laptop should collapse into a vertical stack on an iPhone or Android device. To make launching your site faster and easier, WooCommerce has some great responsive themes available in the WooCommerce Themes library. Emotional connection is extremely valuable in reaching new fans as well as encouraging brand loyalty. And what better way to connect with others than through storytelling? Your brand story is the launchpad for your store’s voice — your writing style, how you connect with customers, and how you portray your business in marketing campaigns all derive from your brand story. By telling visitors about yourself and how your business came to be, what your values are, and where your passions lie, you’ll create a personal and meaningful conversation with your customers around your brand. Add your full brand story to your About page and sprinkle highlights and excerpts of it (e.g. “Building sustainable play equipment since 1977”) on other prominent areas of your website like your homepage, product pages, and even purchase receipts. If you don’t grab your potential customers’ attention in the first few seconds, they’ll leave — 55% of people spend less than 15 seconds on a website. Once you have their attention, the next most important thing is to encourage customers to click through to where you ultimately want them to go. There should be multiple ways for your site visitors to find the product they’re looking for or the solution to their problem. If you only have a few products, feature them prominently on the homepage and use appealing calls to action above the fold (the area that you first see upon page load) so that customers don’t even have to open the navigation menu to search. For more involved ecommerce sites with a large variety of products, make sure that your navigation menu is organized intuitively and that your products are categorized in a way that makes sense. Use mega menus with image thumbnails to highlight specific products and popular product categories. Often, customers just want to find your site search feature and type in the name of or type of product they are looking for. Test your search functionality using product names as well as less specific keywords such as “black striped sundress.” Not satisfied with the search results? Check out extensions like Jetpack Search to add to the experience. Make sure that, on your shop and category pages, customers can easily tell your products apart, understand what each one is, and know how to find out more information. Create filters based on price, color, brand, etc. that will help your customers narrow down your product list. Include category descriptions on your category pages so shoppers know they are in the right place. Review your product pages and make sure each product description is compelling, contains important information like size charts, color variations, material content, etc. and is free from grammatical and spelling errors. Additional product details you might want to add include whether or not the product ships separately, is eligible for a discount, is a limited edition, requires specific care or storage, or requires a minimum order quantity (MOQ). If you don’t ask your customers to purchase, why would they? Use button colors that pop on the page and choose actionable language — “Buy Now,” “Shop Tees,” or “Find the Right Size.” The last thing you want is for an interested customer to leave because they can’t figure out how to check out. Make sure there is a cart icon in the top right corner of your menu that, when expanded, includes a link to the Checkout page. Then, no matter where a customer is on your site, they can make a purchase in just a few clicks. Don’t lose high-intent customers: 50% of U.S. consumers will abandon their cart if checkout takes longer than 30 seconds. So, making the purchasing process quick and easy is crucial to getting sales. You can optimize your checkout by: Are the business address, email address, and phone number easy to find? It’s a standard expectation that you have a contact page with multiple ways for your customers to get in touch. But it can also be helpful to put your customer support information in your site’s footer or offer chat bot support to help customers get connected with you quickly. When a customer logs in, you want them to be able to easily access important information like their order history, billing information, available downloads, and order tracking numbers. Review your customer account dashboard page and make sure that it contains what your customers are looking for. A favicon is the icon that appears in the browser address bar and bookmark list. A recognizable favicon makes it easy for your customers to find you again after they’ve navigated away to another tab. When a customer has your ecommerce website open on one tab and 32 other tabs of cat videos at the same time, you want to make it easy for them to get back to your store. Next on the checklist is making sure crucial functionality on your ecommerce website is working correctly. It doesn’t really matter if your ecommerce site looks beautiful and is easy to navigate if it doesn’t actually work! Check every link on all pages, products, headers, and footers and ensure that they are working. This is not only important from a functionality standpoint, but it’s important for SEO, too. If you have a large number of pages or have migrated your store over from a different ecommerce platform, you might want to run a scan using Broken Link Checker to find and update or redirect all your broken links. Make sure to disable and delete the plugin when you’re done, as it can be a drag on performance. Don’t forget to check your link behavior, too. Most internal links you’ll want to open in the same tab, but if you’re linking to external sites, you’ll want them to open in a new tab so your visitors aren’t transported away from your site completely. You may have other specialty extensions installed, like Product Add-Ons or Mix and Match Products. You’ll want to double check that all your extensions are working together without issue. Most extensions will also have a list of known compatibility issues in their documentation, so you should review that information before you purchase and install any particular extension. These are effective methods of increasing average order value, so you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can do this on each individual product page by going to Product Data → Linked Products. View a more thorough tutorial here. Go through your checkout process in its entirety, from adding a product to your shopping cart, applying a discount code, choosing a shipping location, and making a payment. Check each of your payment methods if you have more than one. Also try checking out and putting incorrect information in — the CVV on your credit card, for example. Does the correct message appear? Make sure an appropriate error message appears so the customer knows what the issue is. After a purchase, what happens? Do you get a notification that an order was placed? Does the customer get an order confirmation? Make sure all of these processes are in place and work with a transactional email service provider to help guarantee email delivery. If you want visual customization of emails along with advanced email and SMS marketing capabilities, check out Klaviyo. You’ve made sure emails are being sent and received, you’ve confirmed checkout is working, but you may have other forms on your site like email signup forms, contact page forms, or event registration forms. Make sure that your customer is able to submit information and receives a confirmation page or email and that you received the form submission. If you’ve migrated from another ecommerce platform, make sure that customers can log in and view existing tracking information, order history, and subscriptions, if applicable. You’ll also want to back up all of your orders from your previous ecommerce site. What happens if someone goes to a bad link or types in an incorrect URL? A 404 page is a great way to guide people to what they’re looking for — make the most of it! Include links to important pages and a search box and you may be able to turn a mistake into a sale. First and foremost, you should make sure that usernames and passwords work for your ecommerce store admins, shop managers, and customers. Next, check to see that your users are all assigned the correct role and access permissions. In addition to the default WordPress admin, editor, and subscriber roles, WooCommerce has a built-in shop management user role and customer user role. You may want to assign more granular permissions to certain staff users with an extension like User Roles Editor, or gate access to specific content or products based on membership status with WooCommerce Memberships. If your customers have to wait for your website to load, they’ll go somewhere else. In fact, 53% of consumers will leave a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. So if your website is taking longer than three seconds to load, check to see what’s slowing your site down and fix those issues before you launch. Below are just a few steps you can take to optimize your site’s load time, but if you want a more comprehensive guide, you can check out this article explaining steps you can take to speed up your WooCommerce site. Serve compressed images that are sized appropriately for the device that they’ll be viewed on. We’ve created a detailed guide on optimizing your images so they load quickly that may be helpful if you’re not sure how to go about it. Caching is a process that temporarily stores copies of data in a location that allows for quicker access compared to retrieving it from its original source. Basically, it speeds up load time. Your host may implement server-side caching, but you can also use extensions like Jetpack or WP Super Cache to help your site load faster. Go through your WordPress backend and delete unused themes, plugins, pages, media files, and posts. Not only can they add more load to your server, slowing down your site, things like unused themes and plugins can be vulnerable to hackers. Plus, outdated content on pages and posts may confuse customers if their content shows up on search engine results pages. As a store owner, you want satisfied customers that have a great user experience on your site and enjoy the products that you sell, but all the happy shoppers in the world won’t make a difference if you don’t have your financial side set up correctly. Poorly thought-out pricing, failing to set up sales tax properly, and misconfigured payment options can all lead to disastrous results. No ecommerce checklist would be complete without asking the following financial questions: At the very minimum, you should price your products so that the retail price covers your cost of goods (COGs) and includes a certain percentage of profit. But profit margins can vary widely across industries and if your products are niche or luxury goods, markups can be significantly higher than more ubiquitous products. Make sure you’ve done some research on pricing for products similar to yours. Don’t be afraid to start off by skewing higher — you can always bring your prices down, but once shoppers get used to lower prices it can be difficult to raise them drastically and retain customers. Taxes are an important element of ecommerce businesses and you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can find your tax settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Tax. You’ll find several options there to fit your situation or you can also install the WooCommerce Tax extension to help you automatically configure sales tax. For a more in-depth guide, you can read our article about how to set up sales tax on your WooCommerce website. Regardless of how you choose to manage sales tax on your site, we do recommend consulting with an accountant or tax professional to ensure you’re taking the right steps. Check your payment gateway settings in WooCommerce → Settings → Payments and make sure they’re enabled and connected to your store. Review your accepted payment methods to make sure you’ve enabled the right ones for your store. In your payment gateway account, itself, you’ll want to ensure that your business’ bank account is connected to your payment gateway account. If your online store sells to multiple countries, you’ll want to provide customers the ability to view products in their local currency. Make sure that the currency conversions are accurate for products, shipping, taxes, and any checkout add-ons. You are launching an online store, after all, so you want to make sure you have the correct inventory count, a way to manage and track that inventory, and that your shipping methods are set up and priced correctly. Here are a few inventory and shipping-related things you should tick off your launch checklist before you go live: Go through each of your products and make sure that the inventory levels are up-to-date and correct. You can edit your inventory settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Inventory and update stock quantities on each individual product page. WooCommerce also offers a variety of extensions that help you sync inventory with your warehouse, Amazon store, eBay store, or other platform. If you have variable products, try switching variations and make sure that prices, variation descriptions, and featured images change appropriately. Whether your shipping calculations are weight-based, product-based, or cart-based, try different combinations to make sure the numbers come out correctly. Check all of the shipping methods that you have available and try different shipping locations. You’ll also want to make sure that any shipping labels you have set up are working. It’s important for your customers to know whether or not you accept returns and what the terms are. Outline how long customers have to make a return, the required condition of the product, how refunds will be received, and who will pay for shipping. If you sell digital products on your ecommerce site, make sure that the right files are uploaded and delivered successfully after purchase. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Downloadable Products to view options for file delivery. Once your store is live, you need a way to drive potential customers to it. And once you have customers, you need to keep them engaged and coming back. On top of that, you need a way to check that your marketing plan is working. Here are a few marketing considerations to check off your ecommerce launch checklist before you share your site with the world. If someone abandons their cart, do you have a way to follow up with them? It’s rare for a customer to make a purchase the first time they visit your site, so make sure you have the measures in place to reach back out. Extensions like AutomateWoo or your own email marketing software can help with this. No marketing plan is complete without an email marketing strategy. In fact, email marketing drives more and more global revenue each year. Make sure you’re using an email marketing platform like Klaviyo or MailPoet to send special offers, news updates, blog posts, and other useful content that can drive sales. Do you know which social media channels you’ll be using to advertise your products? There are a lot of different platforms and not all of them will be the right fit for your business. Don’t spread yourself too thin or focus on a platform where your target customers don’t spend their time. Not sure which platforms you should choose? Check out our guide to choosing the right social media platforms for your store. Once you’ve chosen your platforms, you’ll want to make sure your products and advertisements are set up correctly. If you share a product on Facebook, does the right photo show up? Is your TikTok shop connected to your WooCommerce store? Are your meta titles and descriptions correct? If you need help managing some of this, the Yoast SEO plugin will allow you to edit your products’ appearance on social media. A big part of your marketing plan should be tracking its effectiveness. Google search and display ads as well as social media advertising can all be a huge driver of sales, but you also need to make sure that your ads aren’t costing you more than you’re making with each conversion. Tools like Conversion Tracking Pro for WooCommerce can seamlessly connect your store to your various advertising platforms and help you track analytics all in one place. Content marketing can help your store sell in multiple ways. You can create gift guides that inspire your customers, use blog posts about your business and products that include target keywords to improve SEO, and craft how-to guides and tutorials to help customers better understand how to use your products. Google Analytics not only monitors sales and ad performance, it also tracks a wide variety of user behavior, demographics, and traffic sources. This data can help you better understand who is visiting your site, how long they stay there, the keywords they use in search to find you, what devices they use to access your site, and more. Tools like WooCommerce Advanced Analytics Pro can give you even more advanced insights into important ecommerce metrics like average order value, conversion rate, sales by product or category, and even order refunds and cancellations. All this information can be used to help inform your approach to multiple aspects of your business and marketing strategy, including ecommerce SEO, email marketing, web design, and social media. SEO is a term with a lot of buzz around it, but for good reason. Search Engine Optimization is the art of being found on platforms like Google when people are looking for something you offer. You can spend a lot of time and money on the nuances of every aspect of ecommerce SEO — like keyword research, including the right number of internal links, perfecting your content length, and obsessing over analytics tools — but simply doing the basics right will put you a step ahead of most new ecommerce stores. The meta descriptions for your pages and products are what a customer will see when searching on Google. Make sure that they’re informative and engaging and make someone want to click on your products instead of your competitors’. In addition to your meta descriptions, you might also want to add rich snippets to your web pages. These snippets rely on specific HTML that lets you display things like reviews, product price, product carousels, business hours, and more in search results, helping your site stand out from competitors. Alt text plays a very important role in ecommerce SEO for a couple of reasons. One, it’s a primary way that Google “reads” your images and understands what they display. Two, screen readers read alt text aloud to help those that are visually impaired understand the content. Your alt text should be descriptive of the image and also contain your target keyword in a natural way. While alt text is one aspect of accessibility, there are more considerations. Make sure your font size is large enough to read. Watch out for color combinations like green and red that may make it difficult for someone with color blindness to interpret graphics or text. Add subtitles to product videos so that someone with hearing impairments understands what’s being said. Learn more about why accessibility is so important. The title of your products should be concise and descriptive. Do some keyword research to make sure that you’re formulating product titles that people are searching for. Remember, this is what they’ll see when searching for products on search engines! Your URLs should be concise and definitive. This helps people and search engines understand exactly what your product page is about. For example, it’s much easier to understand what www.example.com/red-dog-leash is about than www.example.com/index.php?id_reddogleash=360&sid=3a5ebc944f41daa6f849f730f1. Also make sure to separate words with dashes instead of underscores. An XML sitemap is essentially a blueprint of your ecommerce website that helps Google understand exactly what pages there are. You can easily generate a sitemap using Yoast SEO or a similar plugin and submit your sitemap to Google using Google Search Console. The last thing you want is for your new website to be hacked and your customers’ information compromised after you launch. That’s why it’s important that you take the right steps to secure your online store! A firewall protects your WordPress website from incoming malicious attacks. Jetpack Security is an excellent option, built by the people behind WordPress.com. Not only does it provide a firewall, but it also offers a comprehensive suite of security tools like real-time backups and downtime monitoring. An SSL certificate encrypts and protects sensitive information, like your customers’ credit card data. Not only is it important from a legal and ethical standpoint, Google also flags websites without an SSL certificate as “insecure.” This can have a negative effect on your visitors’ perception of your brand, or worse — prevent them from accessing your site at all. Use a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters that’s at least eight characters long. You may also want to consider two-factor authentication, which provides additional verification for administrators (like a code sent to your cell phone or authenticator app). This is particularly important if you have post comments or product reviews enabled. It’ll keep your site more secure and save you tons of time filtering through spam. A great solution is Askimet — just set it up and you won’t have to worry about spam again! You should have regular, automatic backups set up for your site files and your database. There are several ways to do this, through your hosting provider or with plugins like Jetpack VaultPress Backup. This tool is particularly valuable for online stores, as it takes backups in real time so you never lose a single sale or piece of customer information. It’s important that you always keep your theme, plugins, and WordPress software up-to-date. Old versions are much easier to hack into. If you’d prefer not to worry about it, just set up auto-updates in your dashboard. Last, but not least on your ecommerce website checklist: double-check (if not quadruple-check!) that you are legally compliant. Having the right legal infrastructure in place protects you from lawsuits and helps your customers understand how you use their data and how your store policies work. You may want to hire a lawyer to make sure you have everything set up to legally run your ecommerce business — it’s well worth the investment! While your lawyer should also be able to help draft your website’s terms and conditions and privacy policies, laws can change and so can the content of your site. Updating your policies regularly can become a bit of a chore. Fortunately there are some online services that allow you to create legally-compliant policies for your ecommerce site that update automatically. Regardless of the route you take to meet your legal obligations, make sure these are easy to find on your ecommerce website. Ask yourself: Terms and conditions lay out the rules of conduct between you and your website visitors that must be followed if they want to purchase your products. To add a checkbox for customers to agree to your terms on your checkout page, navigate to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and select a Terms and Conditions page. A good privacy policy explains exactly how you’ll handle customer information and data on your ecommerce website. It establishes credibility and is an important layer of protection for your business. You can add a link to your privacy policy on your Checkout page by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and selecting a Privacy Policy page. GDPR is a law concerning data handling for European residents. This applies to you if you sell to anyone in the E.U., even if you’re not located there. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with it and adjust policies if needed. You can learn more in our GDPR article hub. The final thing you should do before launch is to have real people test your site. Ask employees, friends, family or, better yet, members of your target audience to use the site and note anything they find difficult or confusing. There’s nothing better than having a fresh set of unbiased eyes going through everything. As the saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” It’s better to get as much as possible right before you launch so that expensive mistakes don’t haunt you later on. Want professional support? If you aren’t already working with an agency, check out our vetted Woo agency partners who have been through the launch process many times and can provide guidance to set you up for ecommerce success. About Great, thank you so much for this post! My website is already launched, but I’ve found a lot of useful tips and points to check out on my website. Especially I recommend everyone to pay more attention to the legal side of your business and security stuff because I know that amazing website can attract visitors, but if these points are weak, they won’t turn into your customers. Absolutely! Legal and security aspects are often overlooked, but they’re definitely critical to a successful website. Glad you found these tips useful! Great! Bookmarking this! It’s fantastic how minutely you’ve covered all pre-requisites at one single space with the best-required details! This is really going to help a lot! WooCommerce community, I bow!

Title: The ultimate ecommerce website launch checklist

Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog May 30, 2025 Launching a high-performing ecommerce site requires precision, collaboration, and attention to detail — especially for established businesses managing complex operations. So how do you know when you’re ready for your ecommerce website launch? You make a checklist. Whether you’re expanding into new markets, replatforming for scalability, or even starting your online business, a structured launch process minimizes risk and ensures your shop is optimized from day one. This comprehensive ecommerce website launch checklist will keep you from getting that, “What did I forget?” feeling. Let’s get into the list. The very first thing on your ecommerce launch checklist should be making sure you’re using the best ecommerce platform. Proprietary ecommerce platforms spend a lot of money to attract and persuade decision makers, but that doesn’t mean they’re the best option. What is a proprietary platform? It’s one where the company that develops and manages the platform controls the code. It requires you to host your site with their hosting services, and if you accidentally violate one of their terms of service, they can permanently remove your store from their platform without giving you a reason why. Before committing to any platform, read their terms of service closely. Some require that you grant them royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted license to everything you upload to their service (including using those materials to train their AI systems). Proprietary ecommerce platforms include Shopify, Wix, and BigCommerce (and there are others). When you sign up with one of these companies, your organizations become subject to many more restrictions than if you build your ecommerce business around an open source solution. If you like all of the bureaucracy and red tape that come with big companies, you’ll love these proprietary platforms. But if you’re planning to create an ecommerce store that you can retain maximum control over and that can affordably grow with your business over time, an open source ecommerce platform like WooCommerce (which powers over 43% of all ecommerce websites) is the better choice. Open source solutions don’t have software-specific restrictions on your products or content, they offer you the freedom to be able to extend and customize your ecommerce store more easily, and don’t require that you sign a contract granting them use of your intellectual property. More importantly, an open-source platform allows you to pick and choose the services and tools you invest in without forcing you to sign up for a plan and pay for more than you need. We’ve got a more in-depth article about why you should choose an open source ecommerce platform, if you want to dive deeper on that topic. But regardless of the solution you choose, make sure that it aligns with your capabilities, business model, marketing plan, goals, and values. Your choice of web host can significantly impact your store’s performance, user experience, and ultimately, your ecommerce success. If you’ve chosen a proprietary ecommerce platform — like a Shopify store — that takes care of hosting for you, your only option for improving your hosting quality will be to upgrade your subscription tier. However, if you’re using WordPress with an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce, you can select any web hosting provider that suits your needs. There are a lot of different types of web hosting out there — shared hosting, VPS, cloud hosting, managed hosting, etc. — so if you’re not sure which type of hosting to choose, read our detailed guide to choosing the right WooCommerce web host. Our TL;DR of hosting: Why not choose a host that’s built for WooCommerce, allowing for easy scalability and dedicated support? At Automattic, Woo’s parent company, we have three hosting providers: Regardless of the exact hosting type you decide on, make sure your ecommerce website is hosted with a provider that can accommodate your store’s needs today and into the future. Make sure you can answer the following questions: Estimate the amount of traffic you expect. A new online business might not need the same resources as an established one with thousands of daily visitors. But even a site with fewer visitors may need robust server resources due to intensive software and processes that are triggered by visitor activity on the site (e.g. forums or online courses). It’s always better to overestimate than underestimate your resource needs and ensure that your host can handle peak traffic and user activity expectations. Your hosting needs will grow as your business expands. Choose a host that can easily scale with your ecommerce store. Some hosts offer autoscaling for occasional surges in site traffic. Autoscaling provides increased bandwidth so that a spike in visitors due to a viral social media post, flash sale, or hacking attempt doesn’t bring down your site. Some hosts offer managed WordPress hosting that’s optimized especially for ecommerce platforms like WooCommerce. If you’re building a WooCommerce store, you may want to consider a host that has a good deal of experience hosting WooCommerce sites. Fast load times are crucial for ecommerce stores. Look for hosts that use SSD storage, content delivery networks (CDNs), server-side caching, and other performance optimizations. Keep in mind that shared hosting can be slower than VPS or dedicated servers because you share the server with other websites. This might not be an issue for a small to medium-sized store, but growing ecommerce websites will benefit from the additional resources that VPS and dedicated hosting can provide. Downtime can lead to lost sales, and hosting companies know this. That’s why the industry standard in uptime is 99.99%. If your host does not offer an uptime guarantee or have a track record of performing at, near, or above that 99.9% standard — steer clear. The only thing better than 99.99%? Pressable offers WordPress-specific hosting with a 100% uptime guarantee. Online stores handle sensitive customer data and all stores should be compliant with rules set by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Look for a host that is a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider and provides security features like SSL certificates, firewalls, and DDoS protection. Reliable support is essential, even if you’re a technical expert. Some website issues can only be handled by your host’s support staff (like server outages and account issues) and if those issues are causing downtime on your site, it can dramatically affect your ecommerce business or your agency’s reputation. Look for hosts that offer 24/7 customer support via multiple channels. A user-friendly control panel can make managing your site much easier. Many hosts offer cPanel or Plesk for managing your site’s files and database. If you choose a managed WordPress hosting plan, your host will have their own custom-built admin interface that you will use to manage your website. Regular backups are an absolute must to protect your site against data loss if someone hacks it or you accidentally delete important content. Make sure your host provides automatic backups and an easy method of restoring those backups to your live site. However, relying on your host alone leaves a massive gap in your security and recovery options. You also need your own real-time, off-site backup system so you can always get back online right away — even if your site is completely down or the problem stems from your host. Consider Jetpack VaultPress Backup for a best-in-class solution. When prospective customers visit your online store, you want your web pages to make a statement. Your store should get their attention, demonstrate professionalism, and show that your products are top-notch. Here are a few important ecommerce web design considerations: Which online store would you rather shop at? One with a domain name of best-dog-clothes-2.angelfire.lycos.com or one called woofandwiggle.com? We’re betting it’s the second choice. Long, non-branded urls feel inherently untrustworthy. They can also cause brand confusion. Can you really be sure you’re on the right website when the domain name doesn’t match the name of the company? An important part of branding is making sure your customers know it’s you, and not an imposter or phishing scheme, when they visit your site. Struggling to come up with the right custom domain name? Check out our article on how to choose a domain name for some guidance. A consistent brand helps potential customers know they’re in the right place. Look through every page of your website for consistent logo usage, fonts, colors, image aesthetics, and layout styles. Make sure you check hover colors and effects for links and buttons to make sure they align with your branding. You should also ensure that the display of any blocks, pages, or elements that may be managed by other extensions match your brand identity, as those sometimes come with their own default styles. Online shopping doesn’t allow customers to feel, touch, or see your products in person. Make sure that you showcase your products from all angles and take close-ups of any unique product details. Even thoughtfully-designed product pages can be quickly devalued by poor photos and video content. Your images and videos should be high-quality, with good lighting, and provide accurate representations of color. User-generated images and videos on your product pages can also be a great way to build brand trust. These don’t have to be as high quality — they just need to be informative, from verified customers, and if they are funny or feature dogs, cats, or a banana for scale, even better! Many devices have retina display screens, which have a higher density of pixels and make content look crisper. If you’re serving up lower resolution images, they may look fuzzy on a 4k monitor or a smartphone. To make sure your images are optimized for display on higher-resolution devices, you can add a retina version that’s exactly two times the size of the original. Many themes include a way to do this or you can use a plugin like Perfect Images. Not only should your images look good across desktop and mobile devices, it should also use a responsive layout that can automatically adjust to the type of device the site is being displayed on. For example, horizontal navigation menus on a desktop display should collapse to a small hamburger-style menu on mobile. Columns of content distributed horizontally across the screen on a laptop should collapse into a vertical stack on an iPhone or Android device. To make launching your site faster and easier, WooCommerce has some great responsive themes available in the WooCommerce Themes library. Emotional connection is extremely valuable in reaching new fans as well as encouraging brand loyalty. And what better way to connect with others than through storytelling? Your brand story is the launchpad for your store’s voice — your writing style, how you connect with customers, and how you portray your business in marketing campaigns all derive from your brand story. By telling visitors about yourself and how your business came to be, what your values are, and where your passions lie, you’ll create a personal and meaningful conversation with your customers around your brand. Add your full brand story to your About page and sprinkle highlights and excerpts of it (e.g. “Building sustainable play equipment since 1977”) on other prominent areas of your website like your homepage, product pages, and even purchase receipts. If you don’t grab your potential customers’ attention in the first few seconds, they’ll leave — 55% of people spend less than 15 seconds on a website. Once you have their attention, the next most important thing is to encourage customers to click through to where you ultimately want them to go. There should be multiple ways for your site visitors to find the product they’re looking for or the solution to their problem. If you only have a few products, feature them prominently on the homepage and use appealing calls to action above the fold (the area that you first see upon page load) so that customers don’t even have to open the navigation menu to search. For more involved ecommerce sites with a large variety of products, make sure that your navigation menu is organized intuitively and that your products are categorized in a way that makes sense. Use mega menus with image thumbnails to highlight specific products and popular product categories. Often, customers just want to find your site search feature and type in the name of or type of product they are looking for. Test your search functionality using product names as well as less specific keywords such as “black striped sundress.” Not satisfied with the search results? Check out extensions like Jetpack Search to add to the experience. Make sure that, on your shop and category pages, customers can easily tell your products apart, understand what each one is, and know how to find out more information. Create filters based on price, color, brand, etc. that will help your customers narrow down your product list. Include category descriptions on your category pages so shoppers know they are in the right place. Review your product pages and make sure each product description is compelling, contains important information like size charts, color variations, material content, etc. and is free from grammatical and spelling errors. Additional product details you might want to add include whether or not the product ships separately, is eligible for a discount, is a limited edition, requires specific care or storage, or requires a minimum order quantity (MOQ). If you don’t ask your customers to purchase, why would they? Use button colors that pop on the page and choose actionable language — “Buy Now,” “Shop Tees,” or “Find the Right Size.” The last thing you want is for an interested customer to leave because they can’t figure out how to check out. Make sure there is a cart icon in the top right corner of your menu that, when expanded, includes a link to the Checkout page. Then, no matter where a customer is on your site, they can make a purchase in just a few clicks. Don’t lose high-intent customers: 50% of U.S. consumers will abandon their cart if checkout takes longer than 30 seconds. So, making the purchasing process quick and easy is crucial to getting sales. You can optimize your checkout by: Are the business address, email address, and phone number easy to find? It’s a standard expectation that you have a contact page with multiple ways for your customers to get in touch. But it can also be helpful to put your customer support information in your site’s footer or offer chat bot support to help customers get connected with you quickly. When a customer logs in, you want them to be able to easily access important information like their order history, billing information, available downloads, and order tracking numbers. Review your customer account dashboard page and make sure that it contains what your customers are looking for. A favicon is the icon that appears in the browser address bar and bookmark list. A recognizable favicon makes it easy for your customers to find you again after they’ve navigated away to another tab. When a customer has your ecommerce website open on one tab and 32 other tabs of cat videos at the same time, you want to make it easy for them to get back to your store. Next on the checklist is making sure crucial functionality on your ecommerce website is working correctly. It doesn’t really matter if your ecommerce site looks beautiful and is easy to navigate if it doesn’t actually work! Check every link on all pages, products, headers, and footers and ensure that they are working. This is not only important from a functionality standpoint, but it’s important for SEO, too. If you have a large number of pages or have migrated your store over from a different ecommerce platform, you might want to run a scan using Broken Link Checker to find and update or redirect all your broken links. Make sure to disable and delete the plugin when you’re done, as it can be a drag on performance. Don’t forget to check your link behavior, too. Most internal links you’ll want to open in the same tab, but if you’re linking to external sites, you’ll want them to open in a new tab so your visitors aren’t transported away from your site completely. You may have other specialty extensions installed, like Product Add-Ons or Mix and Match Products. You’ll want to double check that all your extensions are working together without issue. Most extensions will also have a list of known compatibility issues in their documentation, so you should review that information before you purchase and install any particular extension. These are effective methods of increasing average order value, so you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can do this on each individual product page by going to Product Data → Linked Products. View a more thorough tutorial here. Go through your checkout process in its entirety, from adding a product to your shopping cart, applying a discount code, choosing a shipping location, and making a payment. Check each of your payment methods if you have more than one. Also try checking out and putting incorrect information in — the CVV on your credit card, for example. Does the correct message appear? Make sure an appropriate error message appears so the customer knows what the issue is. After a purchase, what happens? Do you get a notification that an order was placed? Does the customer get an order confirmation? Make sure all of these processes are in place and work with a transactional email service provider to help guarantee email delivery. If you want visual customization of emails along with advanced email and SMS marketing capabilities, check out Klaviyo. You’ve made sure emails are being sent and received, you’ve confirmed checkout is working, but you may have other forms on your site like email signup forms, contact page forms, or event registration forms. Make sure that your customer is able to submit information and receives a confirmation page or email and that you received the form submission. If you’ve migrated from another ecommerce platform, make sure that customers can log in and view existing tracking information, order history, and subscriptions, if applicable. You’ll also want to back up all of your orders from your previous ecommerce site. What happens if someone goes to a bad link or types in an incorrect URL? A 404 page is a great way to guide people to what they’re looking for — make the most of it! Include links to important pages and a search box and you may be able to turn a mistake into a sale. First and foremost, you should make sure that usernames and passwords work for your ecommerce store admins, shop managers, and customers. Next, check to see that your users are all assigned the correct role and access permissions. In addition to the default WordPress admin, editor, and subscriber roles, WooCommerce has a built-in shop management user role and customer user role. You may want to assign more granular permissions to certain staff users with an extension like User Roles Editor, or gate access to specific content or products based on membership status with WooCommerce Memberships. If your customers have to wait for your website to load, they’ll go somewhere else. In fact, 53% of consumers will leave a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. So if your website is taking longer than three seconds to load, check to see what’s slowing your site down and fix those issues before you launch. Below are just a few steps you can take to optimize your site’s load time, but if you want a more comprehensive guide, you can check out this article explaining steps you can take to speed up your WooCommerce site. Serve compressed images that are sized appropriately for the device that they’ll be viewed on. We’ve created a detailed guide on optimizing your images so they load quickly that may be helpful if you’re not sure how to go about it. Caching is a process that temporarily stores copies of data in a location that allows for quicker access compared to retrieving it from its original source. Basically, it speeds up load time. Your host may implement server-side caching, but you can also use extensions like Jetpack or WP Super Cache to help your site load faster. Go through your WordPress backend and delete unused themes, plugins, pages, media files, and posts. Not only can they add more load to your server, slowing down your site, things like unused themes and plugins can be vulnerable to hackers. Plus, outdated content on pages and posts may confuse customers if their content shows up on search engine results pages. As a store owner, you want satisfied customers that have a great user experience on your site and enjoy the products that you sell, but all the happy shoppers in the world won’t make a difference if you don’t have your financial side set up correctly. Poorly thought-out pricing, failing to set up sales tax properly, and misconfigured payment options can all lead to disastrous results. No ecommerce checklist would be complete without asking the following financial questions: At the very minimum, you should price your products so that the retail price covers your cost of goods (COGs) and includes a certain percentage of profit. But profit margins can vary widely across industries and if your products are niche or luxury goods, markups can be significantly higher than more ubiquitous products. Make sure you’ve done some research on pricing for products similar to yours. Don’t be afraid to start off by skewing higher — you can always bring your prices down, but once shoppers get used to lower prices it can be difficult to raise them drastically and retain customers. Taxes are an important element of ecommerce businesses and you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can find your tax settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Tax. You’ll find several options there to fit your situation or you can also install the WooCommerce Tax extension to help you automatically configure sales tax. For a more in-depth guide, you can read our article about how to set up sales tax on your WooCommerce website. Regardless of how you choose to manage sales tax on your site, we do recommend consulting with an accountant or tax professional to ensure you’re taking the right steps. Check your payment gateway settings in WooCommerce → Settings → Payments and make sure they’re enabled and connected to your store. Review your accepted payment methods to make sure you’ve enabled the right ones for your store. In your payment gateway account, itself, you’ll want to ensure that your business’ bank account is connected to your payment gateway account. If your online store sells to multiple countries, you’ll want to provide customers the ability to view products in their local currency. Make sure that the currency conversions are accurate for products, shipping, taxes, and any checkout add-ons. You are launching an online store, after all, so you want to make sure you have the correct inventory count, a way to manage and track that inventory, and that your shipping methods are set up and priced correctly. Here are a few inventory and shipping-related things you should tick off your launch checklist before you go live: Go through each of your products and make sure that the inventory levels are up-to-date and correct. You can edit your inventory settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Inventory and update stock quantities on each individual product page. WooCommerce also offers a variety of extensions that help you sync inventory with your warehouse, Amazon store, eBay store, or other platform. If you have variable products, try switching variations and make sure that prices, variation descriptions, and featured images change appropriately. Whether your shipping calculations are weight-based, product-based, or cart-based, try different combinations to make sure the numbers come out correctly. Check all of the shipping methods that you have available and try different shipping locations. You’ll also want to make sure that any shipping labels you have set up are working. It’s important for your customers to know whether or not you accept returns and what the terms are. Outline how long customers have to make a return, the required condition of the product, how refunds will be received, and who will pay for shipping. If you sell digital products on your ecommerce site, make sure that the right files are uploaded and delivered successfully after purchase. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Downloadable Products to view options for file delivery. Once your store is live, you need a way to drive potential customers to it. And once you have customers, you need to keep them engaged and coming back. On top of that, you need a way to check that your marketing plan is working. Here are a few marketing considerations to check off your ecommerce launch checklist before you share your site with the world. If someone abandons their cart, do you have a way to follow up with them? It’s rare for a customer to make a purchase the first time they visit your site, so make sure you have the measures in place to reach back out. Extensions like AutomateWoo or your own email marketing software can help with this. No marketing plan is complete without an email marketing strategy. In fact, email marketing drives more and more global revenue each year. Make sure you’re using an email marketing platform like Klaviyo or MailPoet to send special offers, news updates, blog posts, and other useful content that can drive sales. Do you know which social media channels you’ll be using to advertise your products? There are a lot of different platforms and not all of them will be the right fit for your business. Don’t spread yourself too thin or focus on a platform where your target customers don’t spend their time. Not sure which platforms you should choose? Check out our guide to choosing the right social media platforms for your store. Once you’ve chosen your platforms, you’ll want to make sure your products and advertisements are set up correctly. If you share a product on Facebook, does the right photo show up? Is your TikTok shop connected to your WooCommerce store? Are your meta titles and descriptions correct? If you need help managing some of this, the Yoast SEO plugin will allow you to edit your products’ appearance on social media. A big part of your marketing plan should be tracking its effectiveness. Google search and display ads as well as social media advertising can all be a huge driver of sales, but you also need to make sure that your ads aren’t costing you more than you’re making with each conversion. Tools like Conversion Tracking Pro for WooCommerce can seamlessly connect your store to your various advertising platforms and help you track analytics all in one place. Content marketing can help your store sell in multiple ways. You can create gift guides that inspire your customers, use blog posts about your business and products that include target keywords to improve SEO, and craft how-to guides and tutorials to help customers better understand how to use your products. Google Analytics not only monitors sales and ad performance, it also tracks a wide variety of user behavior, demographics, and traffic sources. This data can help you better understand who is visiting your site, how long they stay there, the keywords they use in search to find you, what devices they use to access your site, and more. Tools like WooCommerce Advanced Analytics Pro can give you even more advanced insights into important ecommerce metrics like average order value, conversion rate, sales by product or category, and even order refunds and cancellations. All this information can be used to help inform your approach to multiple aspects of your business and marketing strategy, including ecommerce SEO, email marketing, web design, and social media. SEO is a term with a lot of buzz around it, but for good reason. Search Engine Optimization is the art of being found on platforms like Google when people are looking for something you offer. You can spend a lot of time and money on the nuances of every aspect of ecommerce SEO — like keyword research, including the right number of internal links, perfecting your content length, and obsessing over analytics tools — but simply doing the basics right will put you a step ahead of most new ecommerce stores. The meta descriptions for your pages and products are what a customer will see when searching on Google. Make sure that they’re informative and engaging and make someone want to click on your products instead of your competitors’. In addition to your meta descriptions, you might also want to add rich snippets to your web pages. These snippets rely on specific HTML that lets you display things like reviews, product price, product carousels, business hours, and more in search results, helping your site stand out from competitors. Alt text plays a very important role in ecommerce SEO for a couple of reasons. One, it’s a primary way that Google “reads” your images and understands what they display. Two, screen readers read alt text aloud to help those that are visually impaired understand the content. Your alt text should be descriptive of the image and also contain your target keyword in a natural way. While alt text is one aspect of accessibility, there are more considerations. Make sure your font size is large enough to read. Watch out for color combinations like green and red that may make it difficult for someone with color blindness to interpret graphics or text. Add subtitles to product videos so that someone with hearing impairments understands what’s being said. Learn more about why accessibility is so important. The title of your products should be concise and descriptive. Do some keyword research to make sure that you’re formulating product titles that people are searching for. Remember, this is what they’ll see when searching for products on search engines! Your URLs should be concise and definitive. This helps people and search engines understand exactly what your product page is about. For example, it’s much easier to understand what www.example.com/red-dog-leash is about than www.example.com/index.php?id_reddogleash=360&sid=3a5ebc944f41daa6f849f730f1. Also make sure to separate words with dashes instead of underscores. An XML sitemap is essentially a blueprint of your ecommerce website that helps Google understand exactly what pages there are. You can easily generate a sitemap using Yoast SEO or a similar plugin and submit your sitemap to Google using Google Search Console. The last thing you want is for your new website to be hacked and your customers’ information compromised after you launch. That’s why it’s important that you take the right steps to secure your online store! A firewall protects your WordPress website from incoming malicious attacks. Jetpack Security is an excellent option, built by the people behind WordPress.com. Not only does it provide a firewall, but it also offers a comprehensive suite of security tools like real-time backups and downtime monitoring. An SSL certificate encrypts and protects sensitive information, like your customers’ credit card data. Not only is it important from a legal and ethical standpoint, Google also flags websites without an SSL certificate as “insecure.” This can have a negative effect on your visitors’ perception of your brand, or worse — prevent them from accessing your site at all. Use a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters that’s at least eight characters long. You may also want to consider two-factor authentication, which provides additional verification for administrators (like a code sent to your cell phone or authenticator app). This is particularly important if you have post comments or product reviews enabled. It’ll keep your site more secure and save you tons of time filtering through spam. A great solution is Askimet — just set it up and you won’t have to worry about spam again! You should have regular, automatic backups set up for your site files and your database. There are several ways to do this, through your hosting provider or with plugins like Jetpack VaultPress Backup. This tool is particularly valuable for online stores, as it takes backups in real time so you never lose a single sale or piece of customer information. It’s important that you always keep your theme, plugins, and WordPress software up-to-date. Old versions are much easier to hack into. If you’d prefer not to worry about it, just set up auto-updates in your dashboard. Last, but not least on your ecommerce website checklist: double-check (if not quadruple-check!) that you are legally compliant. Having the right legal infrastructure in place protects you from lawsuits and helps your customers understand how you use their data and how your store policies work. You may want to hire a lawyer to make sure you have everything set up to legally run your ecommerce business — it’s well worth the investment! While your lawyer should also be able to help draft your website’s terms and conditions and privacy policies, laws can change and so can the content of your site. Updating your policies regularly can become a bit of a chore. Fortunately there are some online services that allow you to create legally-compliant policies for your ecommerce site that update automatically. Regardless of the route you take to meet your legal obligations, make sure these are easy to find on your ecommerce website. Ask yourself: Terms and conditions lay out the rules of conduct between you and your website visitors that must be followed if they want to purchase your products. To add a checkbox for customers to agree to your terms on your checkout page, navigate to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and select a Terms and Conditions page. A good privacy policy explains exactly how you’ll handle customer information and data on your ecommerce website. It establishes credibility and is an important layer of protection for your business. You can add a link to your privacy policy on your Checkout page by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and selecting a Privacy Policy page. GDPR is a law concerning data handling for European residents. This applies to you if you sell to anyone in the E.U., even if you’re not located there. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with it and adjust policies if needed. You can learn more in our GDPR article hub. The final thing you should do before launch is to have real people test your site. Ask employees, friends, family or, better yet, members of your target audience to use the site and note anything they find difficult or confusing. There’s nothing better than having a fresh set of unbiased eyes going through everything. As the saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” It’s better to get as much as possible right before you launch so that expensive mistakes don’t haunt you later on. Want professional support?
