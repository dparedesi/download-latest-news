Investing Stocks rocket higher to start the week off after a slow end to 2025, and no “Santa Claus Rally” Big energy stocks exploded higher after the arrest of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. This comes after years of assets being confiscated and projects in the country being cancelled. With big institutions and retail investors sitting on cash, it was only a matter of time before they began buying in 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock The futures are little changed after a blockbuster day to open the first full trading week of 2026. The combination of no Santa Claus rally, the market shrugging off the capture of Venezuelan dictator Maduro, then embracing the action, plus some big pent-up money sitting on the sidelines, all helped to propel stocks dramatically higher on Monday. With a slew of economic data and fourth-quarter earnings (expected to be solid) on the way, investors may be resetting portfolios for the first quarter and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrials helped lead the way, surging 1.23% to close at 48,977, while the S&P 500 closed the session at 6,902, up 0.64%, followed by the Nasdaq, which was last seen on Monday at 23,395, up 0.69%. The star of the day was the Russell 2000, which finished trading up a whopping 1.58% at 2,547. Many feel small and midcap stocks could outperform this year, playing catch-up after being somewhat of an afterthought the last few years. After a rough day on Friday, buyers returned to the Treasury market on Monday, driving yields down across the curve. Traders and analysts noted the strength on Monday was primarily due to surprisingly weak U.S. manufacturing data (ISM report) and bullish option trades betting on lower yields, alongside ongoing global factors like Bank of Japan policy shifts and market anticipation of future Federal Reserve actions and strong economic data. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note finished at 4.16%. Prices were up across the energy complex on Monday as the capture of Maduro and the potential for significant oil investment in Venezuela were embraced as huge positives by traders. Brent Crude closed the day up 1.78% at $61.30, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session up 1.74% at $58.32. The only loser on the day was natural gas, which closed down 2.63% at $3.52. Despite massive LNG sales in 2025 and cold weather over much of the country, the sellers were back in force. Not willing to be left behind, Gold continued its relentless push higher, closing on Monday at $4,448, up 2.72%, while Silver continued to rage higher, finishing the day up a stunning 5.19% at $76.55. Continued industrial demand, combined with a surge in retail and institutional buying, kept a strong tailwind behind the precious metals. Many firms are raising their end-of-year Gold target to the $ 4,900-$5,000 range. Last, but certainly not least, after a difficult fourth quarter, the crypto market saw a significant uplift on Monday, with Bitcoin breaking above $92,000 and briefly touching $93,000 before running higher, its highest level in four weeks. Traders cited oversold conditions and some short-covering. Top crypto traders noted that the market is attempting to consolidate at higher levels, with some analysts noting a return to monthly highs and a break above the 50-day moving average. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was trading at $93,850, while Ethereum was trading at $3,237. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.
