The end of the de minimis exemption, briefly explained. by Nicole Narea Cheap goods from China on Americans’ go-to websites — from Amazon to Temu — are suddenly way more expensive. That’s because the “de minimis” exemption for Chinese imports expired Friday by order of President Donald Trump. Under that exemption, shipments of goods whose total value is less than $800 were exempt from tariffs — a threshold that included for most purchases individual Americans make from China. Those days are over. As of Friday, Chinese imports that would have previously fallen under the de minimis exemption are “subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025),” according to the White House. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. Americans will pay the price as retailers pass on increased import costs to consumers. And given how many de minimis shipments arrive in the US every day, that price could be high. A growing number of foreign imports have fallen under the de minimis exemption in the last decade. Between 2015 and 2024, the volume of de minimis shipments increased from 134 million to nearly 1.4 billion. China accounted for the majority of them by far. In 2023, 62 percent of all de minimis shipments, valued at roughly $33.8 billion, came from China. A few factors might be behind the explosion in de minimis shipments, especially from China. For one, the de minimus exemption has been on the books since 1930, but Congress raised the threshold for qualifying goods in 2016 from $200 to $800. That made it cheaper to import more relatively low-value items. The way Americans shop has also changed. Online, direct-to-consumer retail and dropshipping — when a business does not keep inventory in stock but turns to a third-party supplier to send items to its customers — has ballooned in recent years. Many of these businesses rely on Chinese suppliers being able to fulfill and send orders to the US cheaply under the de minimis exemption. In anticipation of the exemption ending, Chinese retailers Temu and Shein announced that they are starting to raise prices. Price hikes vary by category of goods, but Bloomberg reported that Shein prices rose by about 10 percent in a two-day span last week. Temu added “import charges” of 145 percent of an item’s cost and then announced that it would stop selling goods imported directly from China to US consumers entirely. The end of the de minimus exemption doesn’t just affect big retailers, but also small- to medium-sized businesses in the US — for example, individual sellers on Etsy and Shopify. Some such businesses have had to raise their prices and are now reporting a significant decline in US orders, requiring them to diversify beyond the American market if they can, according to CNBC. But the loss of US customers might also force many small businesses to close entirely. For consumers, that means fewer and more expensive options — hardly a sign of the economic revival that Trump promised. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. The vaunted news program is under attack. Gold has become a rare safe bet in Trump’s economy. Trump’s podcasting and new media allies in the “manosphere” don’t know what to make of his tariff policy. The inconvenient truth about trade. Everyone likes cheap consumer goods that will get more expensive under Trump’s tariffs. Roku, Amazon, and practically every company in the streaming business are inventing new ways to make money off your data. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved

Let’s talk about something likely on your mind if you’re a creative professional right now. Things feel… different, don’t they? It seems many graphic designers struggle today, maybe more than ever before. You’re likely feeling the pressure from multiple angles. There’s the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, which seems to be everywhere, promising lightning-fast design outputs. Simultaneously, the global economy feels uncertain, partly due to ongoing trade tensions that affect everything from client budgets to material costs. It’s a challenging combination, creating a genuine sense of unease for many in the design field. Perhaps you’ve noticed clients tightening their belts or asking for more work for the same budget. Maybe you’ve experimented with AI tools yourself, wondering how they fit into your workflow, or if they might eventually replace parts of it. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a significant shift impacting how designers work, find clients, and demonstrate value. The core issue is that the landscape is changing fast. What worked reliably just a few years ago might not be enough anymore. So, what can you, as a talented graphic designer, actually do about it? How can you navigate these choppy waters and steer your career or business back towards stability and success? This article explores the specific challenges graphic designers face and offers practical, actionable strategies to adapt, innovate, and ultimately thrive in this new era. It’s undeniable: the ground is shifting beneath the feet of many creative professionals. The reasons graphic designers struggle aren’t down to just one factor, but rather a confluence of powerful forces reshaping the industry. Let’s break down these key pressures. First off, there’s the elephant in the room: Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI tools like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and even integrated features within the entire Adobe Creative Cloud family are becoming incredibly sophisticated. They can generate mood boards, create mockups, draft marketing copy, and produce unique illustrations based on simple text prompts. For routine tasks, this automation offers incredible efficiency gains, allowing teams to iterate much faster than before. And some former clients think they can just handle their entire company branding themselves these days with tools like Adobe Express or Canva—let’s not even start on the design fails that usually follow. However, this very efficiency poses a threat. It encroaches on services often considered entry-level or commoditized – basic layouts, simple illustrations, template-based work. Why would a client pay a premium for a straightforward social media graphic if an AI tool can generate a dozen options in minutes for a fraction of the cost, or even for free? This leads to significant downward pressure on pricing for volume-based projects. The ease with which non-designers can now generate “good enough” visuals means the perceived value of some traditional graphic design tasks is eroding. This particular aspect is a major contributor to why graphic designers struggle to maintain previous income levels for certain types of work. Alongside the technological disruption, economic uncertainty looms large. Ongoing trade wars and geopolitical tensions create a ripple effect. Businesses become cautious. Marketing budgets, often seen as discretionary spending, are frequently among the first to be scrutinized or reduced when companies anticipate tougher times. This translates directly into fewer projects, smaller project scopes, or clients pushing harder on price negotiations for graphic designers. Furthermore, trade disputes can directly impact the cost of physical goods. Tariffs on materials like paper, ink, and substrates imported from certain regions (e.g., China, EU) drive up the cost of printing. This makes producing brochures, packaging, books, and other print collateral more expensive, squeezing margins for both designers who manage print production and their clients. When costs rise, clients may opt for digital-only solutions or simpler designs, further impacting the type and volume of work available. This economic pressure compounds the difficulties, making the graphic designers’ struggle feel even more acute. There’s another subtle but significant pressure point: evolving client expectations. Increasingly, companies look for creative hires who can do it all – the “one-stop shop” designer. It’s no longer just about static visuals. Clients might expect a graphic designer to also handle motion graphics, basic video editing, social media content creation and management, and perhaps even elements of UX/UI design. While expanding skill sets is valuable, this trend often comes without a corresponding increase in compensation. This “scope creep” means designers are asked to deliver more diverse outputs under the single umbrella of “graphic design,” diluting focus and potentially undervaluing specialized skills. The expectation to be a generalist powerhouse adds another layer to why graphic designers struggle to define their value and charge appropriately. Feeling the pinch? You’re not alone. The combination of AI advancement and economic tightening is genuinely challenging. However, disruption always creates opportunity. The key isn’t to resist the changes but to adapt strategically. Here’s a roadmap with actionable steps for graphic designers looking to transform their business and find renewed success. Instead of viewing AI as purely a threat, consider how you can integrate it into your workflow to enhance your capabilities. The goal is to work smarter, not just harder. AI is great at execution based on prompts, but it lacks genuine understanding, empathy, and strategic foresight. This is where you can truly differentiate yourself. Relying solely on client project work can be precarious in uncertain times. Building diversified revenue streams creates more stability. In an era where AI can generate visuals instantly, your unique perspective, process, and personality become key differentiators. Efficiency isn’t just about design tools; it’s about how you run your business, especially when costs are rising. Look beyond your traditional client base or service offerings. The challenges facing graphic designers today – the rise of capable AI tools and the pressures of an uncertain global economy influenced by trade wars – are significant. It’s understandable why many graphic designers struggle to find their footing in this rapidly evolving landscape. However, these pressures are also catalysts for innovation and growth. The designers who will not only survive but truly thrive are those who embrace adaptability. This means proactively integrating AI as a powerful assistant rather than fearing it as a replacement. It involves doubling down on the uniquely human skills of strategic thinking, empathy, and deep niche expertise where machines cannot compete. Building diversified income streams through digital products and education creates financial resilience. Strengthening your personal brand ensures your unique value is recognized, while optimizing your operations and exploring new markets opens up fresh avenues for growth. The future of graphic design isn’t about being replaced; it’s about evolving. By strategically adapting your skills, services, and business model, you can navigate the current headwinds and position yourself for long-term success. The path forward requires learning, experimenting, and perhaps stepping outside your comfort zone, but the potential rewards – a more resilient, valuable, and profitable design career – are well worth the effort. You have the creativity and the capability; now is the time to apply it strategically to your own business.
