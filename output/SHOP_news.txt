U.S. stock futures are pointing higher ahead of today's release of key inflation data, which is expected to show prices ticked higher in August; Oracle (ORCL) shares are rising further in premarket trading after skyrocketing Wednesday; buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR) shares are pulling back after jumping in their debut yesterday; and meme stock Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) is surging after the firm names a Shopify (SHOP) executive its new CEO. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher ahead of today's closely watched inflation data. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, after each index registered a fresh record closing high Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index declined by 0.5% yesterday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade above $114,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is little changed. Oil and gold futures both are lower. The Consumer Price Index is expected to show that the inflation rate moved higher in August when that report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal project that the CPI report will show that prices in August rose by 2.9% over the past 12 months, up from 2.7% in July. That would mark the highest annual inflation rate since January. Yesterday, the Producer Price Index reading for August ticked 0.1% lower when a rise of 0.3% was expected. The CPI report will be closely watched by Federal Reserve officials, who are considering lowering interest rates at the central bank's meeting next week. Oracle (ORCL) shares are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after soaring 36% Wednesday—their best day since 1992. The stock's blistering gains on strong AI demand has analysts racing to raise their price targets—with most expecting its record run isn't over yet. Oracle also was supported by a The Wall Street Journal report that OpenAI had contracted the company for $300 billion in cloud services over the next five years. Shares of buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR) are pulling back somewhat in premarket trading, a day after jumping nearly 15% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Klarna shares opened trading yesterday at $52, well above their their initial public offering price of $40, and rose above $57 before closing at $45.82, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $17 billion. Klarna shares were down 2% about 90 minutes before the opening bell. Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) shares are soaring about 35% in premarket trading after the online housing platform tapped Kaz Nejatian, the chief operating officer at Shopify (SHOP), to be its new CEO. The company also said co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu would be returning to the board, effective immediately, with Rabois taking on the role of chairman. Opendoor shares have surged since July as retail investors have piled into the meme stock. Opendoor shares ended June trading at $0.53 each but entered Thursday at $5.86.

Hundreds of U.S.-based marketing professionals shared what their businesses pay to advertise on Instagram. Instagram advertising costs depend on several factors, including bids, ad relevancy, seasonality, and industry. On average, though, businesses pay $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Learn more about how much it costs to advertise on Instagram — including how to lower your costs — in this guide! View Instagram Ad Services On average, Instagram advertising costs $0.01 – $0.25 per click, $0.01 – $4.00 per 1000 impressions, and $0.03 – $0.08 per engagement. Lots of factors can influence how much you pay for your Instagram ads, including your ad budget, ad type, industry, and more. Explore how much Instagram ads cost compared to other networks: How much you spend on Instagram advertising costs can fluctuate depending on the size of your business. For example, larger businesses may spend more advertisements to remain competitive. Here’s a breakdown of Instagram advertising costs by business size to give you a better idea of how much your business will spend: (1 – 10 Employees) (11 – 50 Employees) (51 – 250 Employees) (251 – 500 Employees) (501+ Employees) Several factors determine Instagram advertising costs, including the following: Yes. In fact, 76% of marketers say they are happy with the return on investment (ROI) they receive from their Instagram ad campaign. A few of the reasons why Instagram’s advertising costs are well worth the price include: While you can divide your ad spend between networks, Instagram tends to deliver the best performance when it comes to CTRs. A study by Fortune, for example, discovered that Instagram ads maintain a CTR that is 2.5 times greater than other social media networks. Of course, your CTRs will depend on your target audience, as well as your ads. Like Facebook, Instagram provides your business with advanced targeting options. You can use these targeting options, from location to interests, to achieve a higher return from your ads. Instead of targeting everyone interested in sports, for instance, you could narrow that interest to people interested in volleyball. Another reason why Instagram advertising costs are worth the price tag? The results. In a recent study, Shopify discovered that the average order value for Instagram users is $65. Even though Facebook generates a significant amount of social media sales, its average order value is $55 — $10 less than Instagram. Keep in mind, however, that Facebook ads tend to cost more than Instagram ads. A study by Forrester also found that Instagram earns impressive engagement rates compared to other networks. Instagram leads when it comes to engagement rates, offering ten times the engagement rates of Facebook. When you have people that engaged with a network, it allows for your business to benefit from advertising. If you can create ads that target the right users, you can get them to click on your ad, like your page, or buy your product. Besides generating higher order values, Instagram ads also maintain higher conversion rates than other networks. The average conversion rate for Instagram ads is 1.08%. In comparison, the average conversion rate for Pinterest ads is 0.54% and 0.77% for Twitter ads. While the cost of Instagram ads is worth it, it’s important to remember that earning great results from Instagram requires a great ad campaign. You need to develop and optimize your strategy continuously to get the kind of results you want from Instagram ads. On average, businesses allocate 11% – 20% of their total advertising budget to Instagram ads. How much you allocate towards Instagram ads will depend on your company’s unique needs and goals, along with the return you receive from your Instagram ad campaign. When it comes to advertising on social media, you want to do whatever you can to lower the cost for advertising on these platforms. Here are a few best practices that will help you lower the cost of your Instagram ads and maximize your return on them. If you’re new to Instagram advertising, it’s beneficial to use automatic bidding for your campaign. It’s an easy way for you to get a bid that is the best for your campaign. Automatic bidding is beneficial to your business if you don’t have any previous data telling you about a good CPC to set for your campaign. It will help you set the bid amount that’s right for your campaign. When you use automatic bidding, you prevent your business from overbidding to run an ad. The lack of previous data can make it difficult for you to know the best bid amount. You may think you need to bid more than you actually do. Using automatic bidding helps you set the right bid amount until you obtain data that helps you guide your campaign. It’s a great way to reduce your Instagram advertising costs. When you set up your Instagram ads, the goal is to reach people that will be interested in your products or services. To drive the best results for your campaign, use precise targeting to reach your ideal audience. Instagram allows you to target people through: When you use precise targeting, you reach more people interested in your products and services. This means your ad copy will be more relevant to them, which will allow you to get a higher ad rank and lower CPC. It will also lead to an increase in conversions, which helps offset the cost of running the campaign. Whenever you run a marketing campaign, it’s crucial that you set goals for your campaign. Setting goals will help keep you focused on what you want to achieve with your ad. There are three main goals you’ll want to focus on achieving with your Instagram ads: By setting goals, you’ll have a more cohesive campaign. You’ll know what you want to achieve, which will allow you to create more cohesive ad copy. Better ad copy leads to more engagement and more conversions. Creating more relevant landing pages is another great way to reduce your Instagram ad costs. Many companies make the mistake of directing leads to their home page after clicking on their Instagram ad. It doesn’t encourage engagement because people aren’t directed to a landing page that is relevant to the ad. When you create an Instagram ad, the creative and ad link should be cohesive. If you’re advertising your stylish boot collection, your ad link should direct people to a page filled with your boots. Directing them to your homepage isn’t relevant to the ad you created because it’s focused on your entire store instead of specifically focusing on boots! This is where landing pages help. You can direct leads to a page that is created and tailored to your ad content. Relevant landing pages result in more conversions. When people are directed straight to the product they see in the ad, they are more likely to convert. This helps you recoup the costs you pay to run your campaign. If you want to create a truly effective campaign and lower how much it costs to advertise on Instagram, you must build dedicated landing pages that encourage conversion. If you want to lower your Instagram ad price, you must test your ad. Whenever you create ad copy, it’s never going to be the best or most effective version of your ad. It’s crucial that you test to your ad to ensure that you’re putting out the best possible version. Testing your ad helps you create more relevant ad copy. Relevant ad copy means you’ll get a higher ad position, which leads to a lower CPC. It’s an easy and efficient way to lower your Instagram advertising costs.

Instagram ads are paid content that appears in newsfeeds and stories. Instagram ads are targeted towards people most likely to be interested in your products or services. People see Instagram ads based on their demographic data, as well as their interests. These ads are meant to blend in seamlessly to the point where users barely recognize them as ads. There are two indications of content being a paid advertisement. The first sign is the word “sponsored” written under the company’s name. The second sign is the call-to-action (CTA) that appears at the bottom of the picture. These typically have phrases like “shop now” or “learn more” depending upon the campaign’s goal. When you run an Instagram ad campaign, you’ll have your choice of advertising formats. There are four main types of ads: Story ads are the newest option for advertisers to reach interested users. Considering that over 500 million Instagram accounts use stories every day, it’s a great opportunity to connect with people. People take a look at business’s Instagram stories, too. In fact, 33% of the most viewed Instagram stories are from businesses. People want to hear from businesses through the stories function, so having a paid ad wouldn’t seem out of place. These Instagram stories make full use of the screen. If someone sees your Instagram story ad, they will only see that on their screen. It helps you get your audience to focus fully on your ad. Story ads are very effective for your audience. They engage with them and check out your products. Although it’s a newer feature, it has the power to drive valuable results for your business. Photo ads are the most common ads on Instagram. These are pictures that appear in your audience’s Instagram feed. Instagram photo ads appear in a square frame or portrait frame. As mentioned previously, these ads have a CTA button at the bottom of the photo and a sponsored tag. With these ads, it’s crucial that you choose the right photo. You want your photo to fit in with Instagram’s style. Having a photo that looks too stock photo-like will stand out and could deter people from interacting with your ad campaign. To have an effective campaign, you must choose a photo that balances looking like a regular Instagram post with choosing a photo that embodies your brand image. Video ads are another option for your Instagram ad campaign. These operate similar to photos, except the content contains a video. These videos can be up to 60 seconds long. Videos are great for capturing your audience’s attention. When they scroll through their feed and get to your ad, the ad will immediately start playing. It’s a great way to catch your audience’s attention and get them interested in your ad. It’s important to note, however, that the videos automatically play without sound. This is important to think about when you create your video ad because you don’t want your audience to miss important information. If you put your most important information in the first few seconds, your audience is likely to miss it. Instagram video ads are an effective way to engage your audience and get them to check out your business. Carousel ads are a great option to get your audience to interact with your ad. These ads allow you to post multiple photos or videos in one post. It’s a great way to provide your audience with many options for your products. Let’s say you’re promoting a new fashion line. Showcasing one piece wouldn’t do justice to the line. While it does represent the new line, it doesn’t show people the variety in your clothing line. By using a carousel ad, you could use multiple photos and videos to showcase your product line. It enables you to show your audience variety, which engages more people. One outfit may spark interest in your audience over another outfit. Using carousel ads is a great way to garner engagement and interest in your ads. You’ll give your audience multiple visuals to look at and get them interested in your products or services. If you’re ready to start running Instagram ads, there are three different ways to start running ads: When you access ads in the Instagram app, you can share posts you’ve already created on Instagram. You’ll go into the app and select the post you want to promote. Once you select the post, you can launch it as an ad. Once you launch your promoted post, you can start tracking how many people see your post and interact with it. Instagram ads use the same Ad Manager tool as Facebook. If you want to run ads through this program, it’s easy and efficient. When you use Ads Manager, you can set up your campaign, make alterations to your campaign, and monitor the results. It’s a great way to run your Instagram advertising campaign. If you’re short on time or need extra help with your campaign, you have the option to use Instagram partners. Instagram partners can help you run your campaign if you don’t have time or don’t know how to run a campaign. With Instagram partners, you’re working with proven experts that are vetted by Instagram. They will help you buy ads and deliver valuable creative. It’s a great alternative for businesses that don’t have experience.
