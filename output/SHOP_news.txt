See which delivers better ad copy, images, and video. Every day, marketing teams face a crucial decision: Should they rely on Google’s built-in AI tools or invest in custom solutions for specific ad campaign tasks? I’ve watched this debate play out countless times with clients. Google continues adding more AI features for tasks like ad copy generation, headline creation, image generation, and product feed optimization. Meanwhile, specialized tools and custom solutions are thriving, and no real breakthrough for Google AI can be seen. Recent research supports this tension. Gherheș et al. (2025) found that while AI-generated content can outperform human-created alternatives in certain contexts, the quality varies significantly depending on implementation and purpose. Their study revealed that over 50% of users preferred AI-generated informative content over sensationalized approaches, suggesting that how AI is deployed matters more than the technology itself. But which approach actually delivers better results? And at what cost? As Pavlik (2024) notes in his analysis of AI in journalism, tools like ChatGPT don’t simply replace human creativity but rather present opportunities for “improving the quality and effectiveness” of creative work when properly integrated into existing workflows. A recent study by Ameet Khabra compared the performance of human-written versus AI-generated ad copy in Google Ads campaigns. Over an eight-week period with a $500 budget, human-crafted ads significantly outperformed AI-created content from Copy AI, achieving 60% more clicks, a 1.33% higher click-through rate, and a lower cost per click ($4.85 vs. $6.05). Researchers attributed human copywriters’ superior performance to their ability to understand audience emotions, employ creativity and emotional appeal, adapt to specific contexts, and leverage cultural nuances that AI still struggles to replicate. While acknowledging AI’s evolving capabilities and potential value as a supplementary tool, the study emphasizes the enduring importance of human creativity in crafting compelling advertising messages that drive engagement and conversions. Regardless of these mixed research findings, one thing is certain: AI is increasingly embedded in creative processes across marketing, and its integration is inevitable. The question isn’t whether AI will play a role in advertising creation, but rather how marketers can best leverage these tools to enhance their campaigns. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, today’s limitations may be tomorrow’s strengths. With this inevitability in mind, marketers need practical guidance on navigating the current landscape of available solutions. This article compares Google Ads integrated AI tools against third-party and custom solutions for creative and optimization tasks specifically. Google’s AI text generator aims to streamline the ad creation process by converting basic product descriptions into campaign-ready assets. The platform encourages advertisers to input unique selling propositions and key product features to generate contextually relevant ad copy. Upon testing this tool with a simulated video game business specializing in refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles and games, the performance fell notably short of expectations. The output quality was inconsistent, but more concerning were the significant compliance issues observed. In one particularly problematic instance, the system generated the phrase “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” as suggested ad text, presenting a clear trademark infringement risk and potential legal exposure for advertisers. Such critical errors highlight a fundamental limitation in Google’s native AI solution: While offering workflow convenience, it demonstrates inadequate safeguards for brand compliance and legal protection. The system also produced contextually inappropriate messaging, such as “PlayStation 5 Problems Solved,” which misaligned with sales-oriented campaign objectives by suggesting repair services or technical support rather than product offerings. Without careful human review, these problems make the tool risky to use, especially for businesses in competitive markets where mistaken identity or inaccurate representations could lead to serious legal issues and damage to your reputation. When generating longer headlines, there were much fewer results. Only three ad suggestions appeared, one of which included free shipping information for orders over $50, which was a hallucination, as this information was never disclosed in the prompt or the landing page. Creating descriptions was even worse, as there was only one ad suggestion and not even a good one from a copywriting perspective. After trying with different prompts, I was able to get at least five new descriptions out of Google AI. Still, the results were quite disappointing. The ad copy contained hallucinations like the “free shipping over 100 USD,” as well as the business name “Example Video Games,” instead of using the business name of the account or extracting it from the landing page or URL. Overall, underwhelming results, considering Google is one of the biggest companies on earth and owns the biggest online advertising platform. While Google’s AI text generator struggles with brand accuracy and contextual relevance, several general-purpose AI models offer more sophisticated ad copy creation capabilities that balance automation with quality control. Leading general AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini represent compelling alternatives for marketers seeking higher-quality ad copy generation. Unlike Google’s more constrained system, these platforms offer greater flexibility in handling nuanced prompting and brand-specific requirements. In testing with our video game business scenario, we prompted each model to create headlines for refurbished PlayStation 5 consoles. The results demonstrated significant advantages over Google’s native offering: All three models demonstrated superior context awareness compared to Google’s native tool, with each showcasing different strategic approaches to headline creation. They successfully avoided the hallucinations and brand confusion issues observed in Google’s Ad tool, while providing greater headline variety tailored to different marketing objectives. The key advantage these general AI assistants offer is their adaptability and more refined understanding of marketing language. By providing detailed prompting with brand guidelines, target audience information, and specific messaging requirements, marketers can achieve significantly better results than with Google’s more limited integrated tool. For businesses where ad copy directly impacts conversion rates, leveraging these more sophisticated AI options can yield higher-quality creative assets that better represent brand positioning and speak more effectively to customer needs. Despite Gemini’s relevant headline ideas, it struggled to adhere to the 30-character limit for some prompts on Google Ads headlines – a surprising limitation given that Gemini is Google’s own AI model and would be expected to understand Google Ads guidelines inherently – while Claude and ChatGPT consistently produced properly sized headlines without major additional editing or truncation. Image generation is another area where AI can really shine and reduce the workload. Images are a core asset in ecommerce, not only used for product images, but also for category pages, shop banners, display ads, and more. For our virtual video game business, I tried to create some images matching our PlayStation 5 asset group. The results were interesting to say. The first created image looks very similar to an Xbox. Specifically, an Xbox One S or an Xbox Series S, which is the latest model. Now, there are no logos or trademarks seen, and the form factor is a little off. Even more interesting, depending on the exact prompt, Google AI shows an error message related to branded items and content restrictions. Another image created looks a little more like a PlayStation, but not as described and advertised as a PlayStation 5, but rather an older PlayStation 4 model. Again, the content restrictions are most likely responsible for the results. While the image results are somewhat disappointing for those branded items, it is understandable that Google AI follows content restrictions and brand guidelines to avoid any legal issues, as the PlayStation is a trademark of Sony, and the Xbox is a trademark of Microsoft. It’s interesting to see that Google AI tries to work around this limitation and still creates an image, but in that specific case, the image is more or less useless, as there is little value in showcasing a non-existent video game console. A question here would be why the content restrictions and guidelines did not apply to text creation when the text asset “Welcome to the Amazon® Website” was created. To check the image creation quality, I tried a different approach for non-branded items in the dog food category. The image is good at first glance since multiple products are shown with a dog in the picture, supporting the category, but some things are off. The text in the image is still a mess for Google AI. Plus, the proportions are wrong. The dog is way too small, considering the cans of dog food displayed, which are small items. Better than video game consoles, but still not good enough to rely solely on Google AI without any backup or alternative. Using the same prompts to create images, ChatGPT delivers amazing results compared to the Google Ads integrated image creator. Visually, it was able to recreate a PlayStation video game console with a gaming controller. ChatGPT even got details right, except the brand logo, which might be due to some brand protection measures. Also, the latest Xbox model was created with in-depth details. This time, even the Xbox logo was created, maybe because ChatGPT and Microsoft have made a trademark deal of some sort? Or trademark restrictions have some loopholes. At last, the creation of the dog food image was also a success. The prompt included the brand to be named “Doug’s Best Dog Food,” which was perfectly written on the product, along with a nicely placed bowl full of pellets in front of a golden retriever. In comparison, Google AI was able to create a decent image, but upon closer look, issues with displaying words were apparent, which ChatGPT could handle perfectly. Qwen is an image generation tool based on Deepseek, which is a Chinese-based AI developer. The image from Qwen clearly had an “AI” look compared to the ChatGPT or Google AI image. However, it got the brand name “Doug’s Best Dog Food” right. With some improvements, Qwen can produce decent images, if you are okay with having a digital image look. Google AI was able to create a more real-life looking image, with the downside of not being able to display the brand name correctly. Google’s built-in video creation tool aims to make video advertising accessible to marketers without production resources. The tool covers multiple marketing objectives – from brand awareness and consideration to direct sales and app promotion – accommodating various business categories, including apps, products, and services. It offers flexibility with vertical, square, and horizontal formats in lengths ranging from quick six-second spots to 15-second and longer videos. However, the tool’s output quality reveals its limitations. Most videos are essentially slideshows, stitching together static images, logos, and text overlays rather than fluid video content. While this approach democratizes video ad creation, the results often lack the polish and engagement power of properly produced video content. For many marketers, this represents the fundamental tradeoff of Google’s native tools: accessibility and integration vs. creative limitations that might impact performance. At best, marketers get a nice-looking slideshow; speaking of a serious advertising video would be too much. The better templates are mostly for app-related videos, where at least some kind of animation is included with a finger doing some phone touch gestures. Overall, the native video creation tool serves as a backup for marketers who need a video immediately and don’t have any tools on hand. In any other case, it’s best to postpone video creation and start with a more decent tool. Canva makes much better videos than Google Ads’ built-in tools with almost the same effort. Google mostly creates basic slideshows, but Canva gives you thousands of professional templates, animations, and stock videos to use in your marketing. The simple drag-and-drop design lets you make engaging videos with smooth transitions and text effects that keep viewers engaged. Unlike Google’s static slideshows, Canva creates flowing video content that looks professionally made. If you spend just a few more minutes using Canva instead of Google’s tool, your videos will look much more professional and likely perform better with your audience. Alibaba’s Qwen is a strong competitor to Google Ads’ basic video tools, giving marketers better videos without needing special skills. While Google just makes simple slideshows, Qwen uses AI to turn your images and text into dynamic videos with smooth movements and professional transitions. The tool is great at automatically creating cohesive visual stories even from minimal input, adding motion to still images in ways that look professional. What stands out is how Qwen creates animations that actually match your product type and brand style, avoiding the one-size-fits-all look of Google’s templates. Though not as well-known as Canva in the West, Qwen’s AI approach produces polished videos that look intentionally designed rather than template-made, making it a great choice for marketers who want better videos than what Google offers. For the example of a dog food brand, Qwen delivered exceptional results. With the first prompt, Qwen created a five-second clip of golden retrievers playing around and going to a human hand to eat dog food from the hand. Not only did the video look pretty close to real life compared to the Qwen image generation “AI look,” but Qwen also did this as a free tool. No cost involved. If you compare this to the Google video creation, which is basically a PowerPoint presentation, Qwen makes a really good performance. Another great video tool is Sora from OpenAI. Since Sora is included in the $20 Premium membership, you can generate videos at almost no cost, though with some limitations on video quality and length. Still, there are a few tools out there that can generate decent AI video output for that cost. The Product Studio for Merchant Center Next is a beta image optimization tool within the Merchant Center, also accessible via the Google App within Shopify. It allows for creating product images in various scenes, as well as removing backgrounds and increasing image quality. These are two tries to display a gaming controller in a scene. Although the quality of the product image has remained reasonably good, the scenes are barely usable. The image processing prompt was “Showcase this controller in a living room, in front of a TV with neon lighting.” In practice, the desired scene was not even remotely depicted. The controller in front of notebooks or pens is out of place; the second attempt resulted in three black backgrounds and a fiery background. Unlike Google’s Product Studio, which struggles with accurate scene generation as shown in the gaming controller example, several free tools offer more reliable image optimization capabilities. Canva’s free tier includes a background removal tool that produces clean cutouts with remarkable accuracy. While scene creation is more limited in the free version, you can still place products on various pre-designed backgrounds or use their extensive template library to create more contextually appropriate product displays than what you experienced with Google’s tool. To remove backgrounds, use remove.bg, which is a specialized tool that focuses exclusively on background removal with impressive results, even for complex products like your gaming controller. The free version has size limitations but delivers professional-quality cutouts that can then be placed into scenes using other tools. For everything more complex, GIMP is a free and capable tool. This open-source image editor provides robust capabilities for both background removal and scene composition. Though it has a steeper learning curve, GIMP offers precise control over image quality enhancement and realistic product placement. Google’s native AI tools, while conveniently integrated into their advertising platform, consistently underperform compared to third-party alternatives. The evidence is clear and concerning. Google’s AI ad copy generator produced legally problematic content with brand infringement risks and hallucinated product details. Its image generation produced visually inaccurate representations. The video creation tool delivered little more than basic slideshows rather than engaging video content. Meanwhile, third-party solutions or Google’s own Gemini model used externally demonstrated superior capabilities across all creative functions: This performance gap reveals the fundamental tradeoff marketers face: convenience of integration vs. creative quality and performance. Google’s in-platform AI tools provide workflow efficiency but at the significant cost of creative limitations, brand safety concerns, and potential legal exposure. For marketers serious about campaign performance, the path forward is clear: Leverage external AI solutions for creative development, then import these higher-quality assets into Google’s advertising platform. This hybrid approach maintains the advantage of Google’s targeting and delivery mechanisms while avoiding the substantial limitations of their creative AI tools. As AI continues to evolve in marketing, successful advertisers will be those who strategically select the right tools for each specific function rather than defaulting to in-platform options for convenience alone. The evidence suggests that, for now, the marketing advantage lies decidedly with those willing to look beyond Google’s native AI for their creative development needs.

Posted on May 11, 2025 by Aayush Leave a Comment The website builder you pick today might save you headaches or create new ones tomorrow. What truly matters isn’t how easy the first page is to build but what happens when you need more from your site six months from now. In this post, we’ll compare the website builders available today and walk you through finding the right match for your needs. Along the way, we’ll see where WordPress combined with Divi stands when weighing all your options. Let’s discuss what you really need to know before making this important choice. Website builders have evolved significantly, but not all advancements truly benefit users. The features that matter most often hide behind marketing language. Understanding what makes a website builder truly valuable helps you cut through the noise. These key factors separate tools that will support your growth from those that will hinder it: Most website builders promise a world without code, but the truth lies in the details. You click buttons and drag boxes, and your website appears. That’s the dream. When you need something specific beyond templates, website builders take different approaches. Some limit you entirely, while others offer practical solutions through code snippets that extend functionality without requiring you to be a developer. Good builders balance what can be done without code against what’s possible when you need more. They offer plain English settings for complex features while providing pathways to advanced customization. The best platforms keep their code-free promise for daily tasks while giving clear options when your needs grow. They make basic functions simple enough for anyone while keeping advanced possibilities open for when you’re ready to take that next step. Website builders need to scale with your project. Some look great at first, but trap you in their basic features. Six months down the road, you’ll find yourself rebuilding from scratch. Smart builders let your site grow naturally. You start with what you need today: maybe just five pages and a contact form. Next year, when you want to add a shop, membership area, or booking system, those options slot right in. Watch out for systems that force major upgrades or platform changes when adding features. The right builder feels like adding rooms to your house, not moving to a new neighborhood. Your design stays intact while capabilities expand. Great platforms also let different parts of your site work differently when needed. Your blog, store, and main pages might need unique layouts, but should still feel like one connected website to visitors. This kind of flexibility pays off as your goals evolve and expand over time. Website builders work in two ways. Some keep you inside their world with built-in tools. Others connect to a broader range of outside services. Closed systems make things simple. Everything works together because one company runs it all. This works great until you need something they don’t have. Then you’re stuck. Open systems connect to many tools. Need a special calendar? Want a unique checkout? Open systems let you pick the right tool for each job. This matters more as your site grows. That perfect all-in-one package often feels too small when your needs change. Connected systems keep opening new doors as you learn what your site really needs. Look at how many outside services a builder works with. Can it connect to your email service? Does it work with different payment systems? The best builders bring together all parts of your online presence without forcing you into their way of doing things. Website builders should feel natural to use, not like you’re learning a new language. The best ones match how you already think about websites. Good interfaces use words that make sense. They call buttons “buttons” and not “interactive elements.” They organize tools in ways that follow your natural workflow. You shouldn’t need to hunt through five menus to find basic settings. Pay attention to how editing works. Some builders show exactly what your site will look like as you work. Others make you guess until you preview changes. The difference affects how confidently you’ll make updates. The best interfaces grow with you. They offer simple options upfront but reveal more advanced tools as you need them. This way, beginners aren’t overwhelmed, and experienced users aren’t held back. Your builder should speak your language today and still make sense tomorrow. The website builder market continues to divide into two distinct camps, each with different philosophies about what makes a good platform. These fundamental differences will help clarify why certain options might work better for specific needs. Fully hosted builders bundle everything under one roof. Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Shopify run the show behind the scenes while you shape how things look. These platforms are helpful for folks who need websites without technical responsibility. For example, a food truck can snap together a menu page before lunch service begins. You pay monthly, and they handle the boring stuff like security updates. Most people pick these platforms because: The catch? You’ll notice walls closing in as you grow. Your site lives on their territory, playing by their rules. That cool idea you just had might not work here. Many users bump into: These platforms nail it for straightforward sites that fit what they were built for. Your yoga studio, portfolio, or starter shop will feel right at home. But when your needs get specific, you’ll find yourself hunting for creative workarounds or settling for “close enough.” WordPress (.org) offers flexibility that appeals to both beginners and pros alike. This open-source platform powers everything from hobby blogs to major news sites, with a unique approach that separates your content from how you build it. Unlike locked platforms, WordPress gives you choices. Pick your host, select your tools, and build exactly what you need. It doesn’t matter if that’s a five-page local business site or a complex online store. What makes WordPress popular: Most users pair WordPress with page builders like Divi, Elementor, or Bricks Builder, which offer drag-and-drop design. These tools make creating beautiful sites straightforward for anyone. Some considerations: WordPress is suitable for businesses of all sizes. The corner bakery benefits from its simplicity while keeping options open for future growth. Meanwhile, larger operations leverage WordPress’ powerful capabilities without outgrowing the platform. You can start using WordPress right away, but there might be some technical overhead you need to learn. With thousands of articles, YouTube videos, and Reddit threads, among others, it is not that hard to get started. The WordPress ecosystem balances ease-of-use with room to expand, making it suitable for nearly any web project. Finding the right website builder requires more than comparing feature lists. The following will help you develop a systematic approach that matches your requirements with the right solution while avoiding common pitfalls that lead to regrettable choices. Website builders love to showcase their newest features, but the real question is whether those features match your skills. Before comparing platforms, take an honest look at what you can do now. The most impressive demo won’t help if you can’t recreate it when working on your actual website. Are you comfortable with basic design concepts? Do you know a bit of HTML, or do you prefer never to see code? Most people end up with tools that are either too basic or too complex. A good match meets you at your current skill level while giving you room to grow. Try listing what you’re comfortable doing and what makes you hesitate. Then find a builder that fits your abilities but offers clear paths to learn new skills. Website costs go beyond the monthly subscription fee. When choosing a builder, think about the total price tag over time. Many platforms start cheap but add costs as you grow. Need extra storage? That’s another fee. Want that cool feature? A premium plan is required. Custom domain? An annual charge. Some builders require paid add-ons for basics like contact forms or SEO tools, while others include everything in one price. Also, consider hidden costs, such as time spent learning workarounds for missing features or hiring help when you hit limitations. Look at what similar websites to yours need, then check if those features come standard or cost extra. A slightly higher upfront cost often saves money down the road when everything you need is included. Your website needs will change as your projects grow. The perfect builder for today might become limiting tomorrow. Ask yourself where your website might head in the next few years. Will you add online booking? Start selling products? Need member-only areas? What about integrating with CRM systems or email marketing platforms? Many website owners outgrow their first builder within 18 months. They either rebuild from scratch (painful) or work around increasing limitations (frustrating). Many fall into the trap of choosing based on current needs only. A portfolio site might later need an eCommerce component to sell digital products. A simple store could expand to subscription products. A local business might want to add location-based features. Look for a platform with room to expand without starting over. Check if it handles more complex features like custom post types, user accounts, or payment processing, even if you don’t need them yet. The best builders grow alongside you, with clear upgrade paths that don’t require rebuilding everything you’ve created. Good support saves websites from disaster. Yet most people only check support options after something breaks. Website builders offer vastly different help systems. Some provide 24/7 live chat with people who understand your problems. Others leave you searching through outdated forum posts at 2 AM. Test support before committing. Send a question during your trial period and see how quickly you get a helpful answer. Watch for templated responses that don’t address your specific issue. Community support matters too. Active user forums mean solutions exist for common problems. Look for recent posts and helpful replies, not ghost towns of unanswered questions. Also, check the knowledge base. Are tutorials clear and current? Do they cover advanced topics or just the basics? The depth of documentation often reveals how seriously a company takes user success. Likewise, there should be community tutorials. They indicate the possible use cases. Remember: even experts need help sometimes. The right support system turns problems into quick fixes rather than day-ruining roadblocks. Website builders increasingly offer AI features that can be helpful additions to your toolkit. The key is understanding what these tools can realistically do for you. AI assistants should excel at streamlining fairly common tasks: suggesting and creating layout options, helping with content, offering design based on your existing elements, and even refining your current content and assets. During your trial period, explore how these AI tools handle your specific needs. The best ones complement your creative vision rather than try to replace it. Look for AI features that learn from your preferences and adapt to your style over time. The most useful ones become more valuable as you use them. Even simple AI tools can be surprisingly helpful when they address specific pain points in the design process rather than attempting to do everything. With your priorities clear, it’s time to see how the leading website builders compare. This direct comparison highlights where each platform shines and falls short. Rather than general rankings, we focus on specific strengths and weaknesses that matter most when making your decision. Several WordPress page builders dominate the ecosystem, each with loyal followers. Their approaches to design, editing, and site management vary significantly. This comparison reveals which builder provides the best overall experience when building a WordPress site from scratch. Divi, created by us at Elegant Themes, is among the most used WordPress page builders thanks to its mix of adaptability and strength. With the Visual Builder and 200+ modules, you see updates right away as you work, letting you put elements exactly where needed without wondering how they’ll look. Many website projects bog down when building from zero. Divi solves this problem with its library of over 2,000 expertly crafted layouts. Want a particular section? Pick one that is close to your idea and change it to suit your needs. The Theme Builder gives you more than just page-level control. You can craft custom headers, footers, and page templates that work across your whole site, keeping your design steady without doing the same work on every page. Anyone making a new website should check out Divi Quick Sites. Just share some details about what you do, and it builds complete sites based on your input. These aren’t simple templates but well-planned layouts made for your specific needs. If you want extra help, Divi AI can create images, edit photos, And write content matching your tone. Skip the many settings adjustments: just tell it what you want, and Divi AI builds it using your site’s current design patterns. It can even generate sections and code when needed. With the Divi Pro package, you get useful extras alongside Divi AI: Divi Cloud keeps your favorite designs for later use, Divi Teams allows work with up to 4 people (with option to add more), and VIP support gives quick answers when you run into trouble. This bundle can save you up to $751 as compared to purchasing all components separately. Moreover, unlike our competitors, one license works for as many websites as you want with no content limits. Divi connects well with over 75 tools and plugins, including top SEO tools that work right in the editor. If you have questions, the 76,000-member community on Facebook offers practical tips from their own use. Plus, with our Marketplace, you won’t run out of extensions, child themes, and more created by trusted Divi experts. Divi is different from other WordPress builders because it mixes simplicity with advanced features. This combination works well for both newcomers building their first site and experts creating complex web projects. Get Divi Now Divi 5 (currently in alpha but ready for new website builds) introduces powerful new ways to build WordPress websites. Its thoughtfully designed structure helps you create sites that load quicker and perform better. Besides a ground-up redesign of the builder to eliminate shortcodes and move towards a block-based approach, Divi 5 introduces several quality-of-life improvements to the builder, such as multi-panel docking that keeps your design tools accessible but organized and canvas scaling, which shows exactly how your site looks at different screen sizes with a simple drag of the workspace edge. Design consistency becomes effortless in Divi 5. The new Option Group Presets save styles for buttons, headings, and other elements you can apply to your site. Design Variables store your brand colors, fonts, and spacing values in one central location. Need to update your brand blue? Change it once, and every instance updates automatically. Responsive design reaches new levels with customizable breakpoints, giving you control at specific screen widths beyond standard device sizes. Advanced CSS functions now work natively in Divi’s fields, use calc() for dynamic measurements, clamp() for perfectly scaling typography, and min()/max() for intelligent layouts. One of the biggest additions in Divi 5 is the ability to nest rows. You can now place rows inside other rows, letting you build complex and elegant layouts. Want a special section with its own row structure? Just add it inside an existing row. This sets the stage for Divi’s move toward flexbox layouts. Soon, you’ll have much better control over how your content behaves — from spacing between columns to how elements stack on phones. The days of fighting with CSS to align things perfectly are coming to an end. Divi 5 delivers the perfect balance between simplicity and power. You’ll create better websites faster, regardless of your experience level, while maintaining complete creative freedom. Even though it’s currently in the preliminary alpha version, you can start using it on fresh websites today, and it’s accessible to all ongoing and new clients. Nonetheless, we advise against implementing Divi 5 on an existing Divi site at this moment. Gutenberg ships with WordPress right out of the box. On its own, it gives you a basic set of tools, but with a handful of addons like Stackable, Kadence Blocks, or Spectra, you can turn it into something much more useful. These popular addons give you ready-made sections, cool layouts, and specialized blocks that make building pages less of a headache. What makes Gutenberg work well is how it stacks content pieces in a way that makes sense, similar to how you might organize sections on paper. The block editor plays nicely with WordPress core functions, keeping your site running fast without the extra code bloat you’ll find elsewhere. Getting used to Gutenberg takes some time since it doesn’t follow the usual drag-and-drop approach of other builders. But after you work with it for a bit, you’ll find making updates becomes second nature. But, Gutenberg, and naturally all of its addons, are very clunky to use, and the options aren’t as intuitive as other, more mature, thought-out website builders. As WordPress keeps improving Gutenberg each year, staying with this option means your site tools keep getting better automatically. Elementor took the WordPress world by storm with its smooth drag-and-drop approach. The free version gives you enough tools to build good-looking sites, while the Pro version unlocks theme building and advanced widgets. You can move things exactly where you want them on the page with real-time previews showing exactly what visitors will see. The spacing controls let you nudge elements into place without touching code, and the responsive options make sure your site looks good on phones too. This builder stands out for its massive widget library that handles everything from basic text to booking forms and pricing tables. The templates save tons of time – just pick one that looks close to what you want and change the parts that need tweaking. The ecosystem includes specialized add-ons from third-party developers that extend what you can build. Bricks Builder is a newer WordPress page builder that appeals to users with some tech background. The tools are arranged sensibly, but many features use terms that assume you know the basics of web design. Bricks focuses on clean code and faster loading times by cutting out extra bulk. You pick elements, adjust their settings, and see changes right away, much like other builders but with more technical options visible. Beginners might find it harder to learn at first. While anyone can use the basic tools, many of the best features need some understanding of CSS, queries, and conditions. This makes it less friendly for total newcomers. The builder includes code sections, dynamic data options, and site-wide style controls that developers and designers appreciate. There aren’t as many templates as older builders, though the collection keeps growing. People who switch to Bricks often mention the cleaner code and more logical setup as big pluses, but those without tech skills might need to look up terms more often while building. Having explored each WordPress builder’s capabilities, one question remains: which one actually performs best when building real websites? Let’s compare these tools based on what truly matters for website owners to determine which builder delivers the most value for your specific needs. Get Divi Today After looking at the key factors that matter for website success, Divi stands out as the clear winner in the WordPress builder space. While Divi does require some time to master, the investment pays off through unmatched design flexibility and value that competitors simply cannot rival. Both newcomers and seasoned professionals benefit from a tool set that adapts to their growing needs without forcing compromises. When looking for a builder that evolves alongside your skills and business objectives, Divi consistently delivers where alternatives fall short. Hosted platforms like Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Shopify compete fiercely for different market segments. Each has strengthened certain aspects of its offerings while maintaining core limitations. Let’s compare how they compare when tested with real business requirements. Wix offers both beginners and seasoned web designers a straightforward path to website creation. The platform stands out with its hands-on editor that lets you move elements anywhere on your page. You won’t need coding skills to build something that looks professional. What makes working with Wix so straightforward? Consider these aspects: Many website owners appreciate how Wix combines all these tools in one package without making things complicated. The platform works well for simple portfolio sites but has enough power for business websites with online stores too. Squarespace stands out with its visually striking templates and focus on visual impact. The platform puts design first, making it a go-to choice for photographers, artists, restaurants, and boutiques who need sites that catch the eye. Squarespace hits the sweet spot for creatives and small shops who want polish without complexity. Webflow lets you build fancy websites without coding. You get the same results as hand-coded sites but through a visual editor anyone can use. Many web designers love it. Webflow works great for people who know design basics but don’t want to mess with code. Shopify specializes in eCommerce websites. The platform focuses on selling products rather than general website features. Shopify works for various business sizes, from single-product startups to established brands with hundreds of items. After walking through each platform, let’s cut through the fluff and get practical about which builder works best for specific needs. No platform wins across all categories, but clear winners emerge when you look at what actually matters for different website types. Looking at the full picture, Wix stands out for most website owners. The platform balances ease of use with powerful features that work as your site grows. While others excel in specific areas, Wix delivers what matters daily: building what you want without constant roadblocks. With Wix matched against Divi on WordPress, we can finally see how they handle real-world challenges. This side-by-side test reveals surprising strengths and weaknesses that only become apparent when building actual sites. 🤝 Winner: Tie with Different Strengths — Wix gets beginners started faster, while Divi requires some learning but becomes more efficient for ongoing work. Both are strong options depending on your starting point and long-term plans. 🥇 Winner: Divi — Divi provides substantially more design freedom with no arbitrary limitations. The Theme Builder allows complete site-wide design control that Wix simply cannot match, especially for headers, footers, and dynamic templates. 📈 Edge: Divi — The numbers make the case here. Divi costs less over time, especially if you build more than one site. The upfront price is higher but saves money down the road. 🥇 Winner: Divi — WordPress with Divi gives you more technical freedom. You’re not locked into one company’s system, which matters if your needs change later. 🥇 Winner: Divi — Both handle everyday website needs well, but Divi scales better for growing sites. The WordPress foundation means fewer walls as your site expands. After looking at the key features, you’ll find that Divi for WordPress is usually the best choice for most website projects. Wix is easy if you’re just starting, but you’ll soon hit limits that are hard to work around. With Divi, you get a tool that’s easy for beginners but also powerful enough to handle anything you want to build later. If you spend a little time learning it, you’ll enjoy more creative options, better flexibility, and save money in the long run. If you want your website to grow with your needs, Divi isn’t just a builder. It’s a full solution. You can keep improving your site without starting over or moving to another platform. Website builders shape how your online presence grows or gets stuck. Choose wisely the first time. The right builder matches both your current skills and future plans. Consider what features truly matter, how much support you’ll need, and whether AI tools actually help your workflow. Look beyond the monthly subscription to calculate total ownership costs. Will you require paid add-ons, extra storage, or developer help? WordPress + Divi stands out by offering both simplicity and scalability. While many builders force compromises as your needs evolve, Divi grows alongside your vision, maintaining a balance of user-friendly tools and professional capabilities. Take time now to pick a foundation that adapts to you. Build your website once, then focus on what truly matters — growing your presence online. Get Divi Today Explore plans, pricing and features.
