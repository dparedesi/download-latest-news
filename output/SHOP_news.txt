Commerce is fragmenting across platforms, AI agents, and social feeds while customers expect seamless experiences everywhere. Platforms excel at discovery and impulse purchases, but websites remain the trust anchor for considered purchases and long-term relationships. Merchants who orchestrate all three channels — rather than betting everything on one — will capture more customers and keep more margin. Picture this: a frazzled parent types “Plan my kid’s birthday party under $300” into ChatGPT. Within seconds, they’ve got a theme, a supply list, and links to buy everything — cake topper, streamers, party favors, and bags — without ever typing a URL or landing on a homepage. Meanwhile, a 20-something scrolling TikTok at 11 p.m. watches a creator demo a skincare routine, taps “buy,” and has three products headed to their door before the video ends. These are hardly hypotheticals anymore. TikTok Shop hit $33.2 billion in global gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2024, with $9 billion from the U.S. alone: a 650% year-over-year explosion just 16 months after launch. The broader U.S. social commerce market has already reached $114.7 billion in 2025. And Morgan Stanley predicts that nearly half of U.S. online shoppers will be using AI shopping agents by 2030, potentially adding $115 billion to e-commerce. If you’re a merchant reading those numbers, you might feel the ground shifting beneath your carefully optimized product pages. Should you abandon your website and go all-in on social? Is your homepage about to become as relevant as a phone book? Well, here’s where things get interesting. DreamHost’s Local Business Trust Index found that shoppers are 7x more comfortable making purchases of $100 or more on a company’s website than through social media platforms. They’re also 14x more likely to spend $500+ on a website. And their average comfortable spending amount? Just $36 on social platforms, versus $177 on a website. So no, your website isn’t dead, but it might be changing jobs. Let’s unpack what’s happening and what it means for your online storefront. Two forces are reshaping how people buy things online: the explosive growth of social commerce and the emergence of AI shopping agents. Together, they’re creating a world where your next customer might discover, evaluate, and even purchase products without ever intentionally visiting your website. But there’s a persistent trust gap that keeps your owned digital presence more relevant than ever. The numbers show a fundamental shift in where commerce happens. While social commerce has been growing for years, AI shopping agents represent something newer, and potentially even more disruptive. On Black Friday 2025, AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites surged 805% year-over-year, helping drive $11.8 billion in online spending, a new record. The practical implications are significant. ChatGPT already has a Shopify integration for in-chat purchases. Amazon’s Rufus, Walmart’s Sparky, and Target’s ChatGPT integration are making AI-assisted shopping feel as natural as asking a store associate for help. Plus, AI browsers, like Perplexity’s Comet, let users drop in a grocery list and have the AI add everything to their cart automatically. Discovery, comparison, and increasingly even checkout are happening inside platforms and AI assistants — not on your homepage. But that’s only half the story. For all the excitement around social commerce and AI agents, there’s a fundamental asymmetry in where people are willing to spend serious money. When we conducted our Trust Index survey in November, our findings were striking: Social platforms are optimized for entertainment and discovery, not for detailed product information, clear return policies, and brand credibility signals that people need before making significant purchases. What does this mean for retailers? Platforms excel at getting you seen, but your site is still where serious spending and long-term trust live. When you cut through the noise, we see three shifts that will actually shape how you sell online in the next few years. Think of social commerce as window shopping on steroids, especially for Gen Z and younger millennials. The format rewards scrolling, discovery, and split-second purchase decisions. You see something interesting in a 30-second video, you tap buy, it shows up in three days —the friction between “that looks cool” and “I own it” has essentially disappeared. The platform isn’t replacing traditional e-commerce, but it is creating a new category: the ambient, entertainment-driven impulse buy. 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Use TikTok and Instagram as discovery engines and low-friction checkout points for products under $50: bundles, limited drops, trending items. This is your impulse shelf. For higher-value items, use social content strategically to nudge people back to your website, where they can explore your whole brand story, detailed product specifications, shipping policies, and authentic customer reviews.

AI shopping agents are essentially digital personal shoppers that can follow instructions, stick to budgets, compare options across multiple retailers, and even complete checkout. They’re moving from novelty to infrastructure faster than many merchants realize. The major players are already in the market: ChatGPT with Shopify integration, Amazon’s Rufus, Walmart’s Sparky, Target’s ChatGPT integration, and dedicated AI browsers like Perplexity’s Comet. These tools can create grocery lists, research products, compare prices, and automatically add items to carts. AI agents aren’t making emotional decisions or responding to flashy graphics. They’re optimizing for specific criteria. Here’s how agents choose which products to recommend: 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Make your catalog machine-readablewith special attention to your data hygiene. Fill in product attributes consistently (materials, sizing, compatibility), use descriptive, honest product titles, add structured data/schema markup, and answer common questions directly on product pages so AI has something trustworthy to quote. AI-native browsers and OS-level assistants are making commerce feel like a conversation rather than a destination. Comet lets users create a grocery list and have the AI add items to their Instacart cart automatically. OpenAI’s Atlas browser is built around the same premise: tell it what you need, and it handles the shopping. Meanwhile, retailer assistants like Rufus, Walmart’s AI tools, and Target’s ChatGPT integration are making checkout feel like one tap from anywhere. The boundary between “browsing the internet” and “shopping” is dissolving. 👉What it means for e-commerce retailers: Customers might first encounter your brand inside someone else’s interface, like an AI chat, a voice assistant, or a browser sidebar. This changes what they see first, but not what matters: In light of all of this, do you need to reframe what your website actually does? Maybe. Your site is no longer just an “online store”. Now, it’s the source of truth for everything else in your commerce ecosystem. Your website is the authoritative answer to every question an AI agent, comparison shopper, or cautious buyer might ask. Materials? Dimensions? Return window? Warranty? When an AI is deciding whether to recommend your product, it’s pulling from your product pages. When a customer is deciding whether $200 is worth it, they’re checking your site for reassurance. Social platforms and AI agents can introduce people to your brand. Your website is where they come to validate what they discovered. Customer reviews, testimonials, your origin story, your values — these live on your site. This might be the most important function of all. When someone buys through TikTok Shop or an AI agent’s recommendation, you get a transaction. When they buy through your website, you get a relationship: email addresses, purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior. This is data no platform can take away, and no algorithm change can erase. Big-ticket purchases and long-term relationships still consolidate on websites. Social and AI channels are discovery mechanisms; your site is where commitment happens, and you can map the entire customer journey. At DreamHost, we’ve been championing website ownership for over 27 years. Owning your site is how you maintain control of your brand, data, and margins while the rest of the internet experiments with new ways to shop, and while the internet becomes increasingly subscription-based, we’re advocating more than ever for the open web. So how should e-commerce merchants navigate this new landscape as it emerges? Here’s a four-step framework you can use. Before chasing new channels, make sure your foundation is solid. Make your site the strongest version of itself: fast, mobile-friendly, and clear. Add reviews. Publish detailed policies. Provide content that answers questions before shoppers ask them. Each improvement compounds your trust advantage, and helps both humans and algorithms see your store as credible. The fear of missing out on TikTok Shop or Instagram Shopping is real. But the merchants who succeed with social commerce treat it strategically. Pick one or two platforms where your audience already lives. Test product angles, creator partnerships, bundles, and price points. Let social give you rapid consumer insight, but don’t rely on it for long-term stability. Preparing your store for AI shopping agents doesn’t require technical expertise. It requires discipline and consistency. Think of it as giving AI a clean transcript of your store, so agents can understand and represent your products accurately. If you’ve been in e-commerce for more than a few years, you’ve seen platforms change their rules overnight. Algorithm updates, policy shifts, regulatory uncertainty — any single channel can become unreliable with little warning. Here’s how to protect yourself: Every few months, there’s a new platform, a new AI integration, a new commerce channel that everyone insists you need to be on immediately or risk irrelevance. Here’s a checklist for cutting through the hype. Before jumping on any new platform or tool, ask yourself: The merchants who thrive in rapidly changing environments aren’t the ones who chase every trend. They’re the ones who test intelligently, measure honestly, and know when to double down versus when to walk away. AI agents and social commerce will increasingly handle discovery and low-friction purchases. That’s not a threat — it’s a distribution opportunity. New channels mean new ways for customers to find you, new moments to capture attention, and new paths to purchase. But websites remain the trust anchor, the data source, and the place where real customer relationships live. When someone’s deciding whether to spend $200, they’re not doing it in a TikTok comment section. When they want to understand your brand, read reviews from people like them, or know exactly what they’re getting — they come to your site. Owning your site isn’t about resisting change. It’s about having a home base while you explore what’s next — keeping control of your brand, data, and margins while the rest of the internet experiments with new ways to shop. Sell anything, anywhere, anytime on the world’s biggest online store platform. John Robison John is the Director of Product (WordPress) at DreamHost.

Title: The gap between Gemini and ChatGPT is narrowing

After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into "code red" emergencies. Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October. When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday. For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop. "The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it," Furner said in the press release. In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience. AI is reshaping the discovery process even further. While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways. In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3. The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter "insane" in a viral post. The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a "code red" at his company. Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV. Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol. "AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. "To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey." Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider. OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is "an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases." It was developed alongside Stripe. Google's mission appears to be similar. In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol. In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience. He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said. Jump to
