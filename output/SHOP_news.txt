It doesn't pay to ignore online shoppers, and Wix Stores ensures that your products or services appear in front of as many potential customers as possible. The e-commerce platform combines a website builder with site creation tools that let you build a professional online shop with no coding knowledge required. You'll pay slightly more money than you would for a standard Wix site, but chances are you'll find the results are well worth it. Accordingly, Wix Stores earns our Editors' Choice award alongside Shopify for e-commerce services geared toward beginners and small businesses that want to sell digital and physical goods. Wix Stores is Wix's e-commerce arm, and you can set up an account in two ways. One method is to visit Wix.com and sign up for at least the Core hosting plan (you cannot accept payments using the entry-level Light tier). The three Wix business-centric plans—Core, Business, and Business Elite—provide e-commerce tools, too. There's also a bespoke Enterprise plan. The second method is for people who created a site using a traditional Wix website builder: the free Wix Stores add-on app. You can find the app in the Wix App Market and add it to your website with just a few clicks. Either method you choose gets you essentially the same service. Due to Wix Stores' proprietary tech, you cannot use the app with other web hosts. Wix offers more affordable plans that don't include e-commerce elements, but for the sake of this review, we'll focus on the site builder plans that offer selling options. Core ($27 per month, with discounts for annual plans) offers a free domain for a year, 50GB of storage, 50,000 products, drop-shipping, gift cards, and the ability to sell products via social channels. That's just the tip of the iceberg; Wix Stores is stacked with potential money-making features. The $39-per-month Business plan (with discounts for yearly plans) builds upon Core by including 100GB of storage, subscriptions and recurring payments, USPS shipping discounts, user reviews, and the ability to sell in online marketplaces. Business Elite ($149 per month, with discounts for long-term plans) has a loyalty program, custom reports, priority customer care, and unlimited storage. The top-tier Enterprise plan (contact Wix for a custom price quote) adds many advanced features, including enterprise-grade security and VIP-level customer support. Wix charges 2.9% and 30 cents for transaction fees across the board. Comparatively, Shopify offers three packages as part of its standard offering: Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify. They include 10 fulfillment locations, shipping discounts, and the POS Lite software system for brick-and-mortar businesses. Unlike Wix Stores, Shopify has varied transaction fees. It also includes unlimited bandwidth and storage, which is helpful for companies with deep inventories that expect heavy traffic volumes. Like PinnacleCart, Wix Stores is not only a capable and customizable site builder, it's also extremely easy to use. When you start your account, the software site creation wizard asks which kind of store you'd like to create. We created an online store, but we were presented with other site types, such as a blog or an appointment booker. From there, we used the seven-step Set Up Your Site walk-through. Using the tool, purchasing a URL, establishing shipping regions, and making the site Google-friendly by adding keywords, favicons, and other SEO-friendly elements was a breeze. The draw is the product database, which is simple to build and maintain. It lets you upload photos (from your own collection or Wix's massive stock photo library), add descriptive text, and log item counts. For existing companies, Wix Stores asks you to enter your website name, address, and phone number. The tool searches the web for your information. It can find and incorporate your social media accounts and images, and pull the content into your site editor. The design wizard lets you add a gallery, donate page, blog, chat window, or whatever is pertinent to your business. In short, Wix Stores is quite flexible. Like Squarespace, Wix doesn't let you switch templates once you've chosen one. That's a significant ding against the service, as you need to create a separate site and transfer your files to the new pages to give your online destination a fresh look. For more on how the services compare, check out Wix vs. Squarespace. Once your site is up and running, you can use the Promote tab to create social media posts to Facebook and Instagram (you can add others), and conduct basic email marketing. Wix Stores accepts payments via credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Square, and Stripe. It also accepts point-of-sale (POS) transactions. With any account above the Core tier, Wix Stores offers automated shipping and tax rates. Otherwise, you must set a standard price for both figures and manually adjust taxes and shipping. Like Shopify, Wix Stores lacks a free trial. On the upside, Wix Stores supports developer application programming interface (API), so you can create third-party integrations outside of the Wix App Market—if you know JavaScript. If you don't want to do that, the Wix App Market contains hundreds of add-ons. Wix Stores offers 24/7 phone and chat-based support when emailing is not enough. We found it easy to get someone in chat even in the morning's wee hours, and the phone support representative helped answer our questions about the different options available in each package.Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of a hosting service. If your site is down, clients or customers cannot find you or access your products or services. Wix has a 99.9% uptime rate, and you can monitor the service's uptime via the company's status page. If your goal is to create a gorgeous e-commerce site that's easily edited, Wix Stores is an excellent option. Its wide breadth of features and deep well of stock media are points in its favor, helping you create and customize a site that's uniquely yours. Whether you're an e-commerce wizard or a web-building novice, Wix Stores makes it easy to sell products or services online, earning it our Editors' Choice award alongside Shopify.
