Title: Markets climb as Trump teases UK trade breakthrough

U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with major indexes climbing. Tech led the day’s rally, and the Nasdaq closed up slightly over 1%. The S&P 500 rose 0.58% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 254 points, or 0.62%. The surge was brought on by President Trump’s announcement of a trade deal Thursday with the United Kingdom— his first since April’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs. In other White House news, Trump is also expected to roll back and replace Biden-era AI chip rules. Markets are absorbing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s latest remarks. The central bank announced Wednesday that it will hold interest rates steady, with Powell taking a wait-and-see stance. While the job market remains healthy and core inflation is easing, tariffs are introducing new economic uncertainty, Powell said. He made it clear the Fed is in no rush to shift course, emphasizing the need for more data — especially on how tariff-driven price pressures play out. Elsewhere, central banks abroad are cutting rates, but they’re not contending with the exact same inflationary wildcards. On Wednesday, Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell 7% on reports that Apple (AAPL) may integrate AI tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity into Safari, threatening Google’s dominance as the browser’s default search engine. During federal antitrust testimony, Apple executive Eddy Cue said Safari search volume had declined for the first time — signaling that users are already shifting toward AI alternatives. With Google paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year for default status, the news rattled investors and sparked fresh concerns about Alphabet’s long-term search moat. Apple shares initially fell 2% on the same news, but both companies gained on Thursday, with Alphabet up 1.9% and Apple up 0.6%, too. AB InBev (BUD) kicked off the earnings day with a solid report. The brewer posted nearly 8% EBITDA growth and stronger margins, even as volumes slipped 2.2% due to tough comps and weather. Mega-brands such as Corona — up 11% outside its home market — led the way, while no-alcohol and direct-to-consumer sales also notched meaningful gains. The company reiterated its 2025 outlook and emphasized ongoing investments in premium products and digital platforms. Shopify (SHOP) reported before the bell today. Energy majors ConocoPhillips (COP) and Cheniere Energy (LNG) also announced earnings today, alongside Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) and Brookfield (BAM), offering a look at global demand, margins, and infrastructure amid falling oil prices.

I like your website - Mostly Melbourne. Mostly. Why buy this when the Iniu P63 is 25000mAh, 100W, 400g and $80? Inu looks like it would have pouch cells versus this looks like it has cylindrical cells. Cylindrical cells can be safer. Safer but bigger, heavier and possibly more loss due to heat All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.
