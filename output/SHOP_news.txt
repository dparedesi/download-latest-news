(Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) enables businesses to build online storefronts and sell directly to consumers. Its notable clients include Skullcandy, Daily Harvest, and Carrier. Shopify’s stock has dropped 20% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is down 10%, amid a broader market downturn. Despite this, Shopify’s financial performance remains strong, with Q4 2024 revenue rising 31% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $2.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings increasing 29% y-o-y to $0.44 per diluted share. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are at their lowest since Shopify’s 2015 IPO, and the Q4 take rate improved by 12 basis points. Gross merchandise volume increased 24% to $94.5 billion. Shopify's subscription-based revenue model, driven by contract and transaction fees, creates a consistent income stream. Furthermore, its use of AI improves customer experience and helps drive retention, supporting long-term growth. Shopify’s stock seems like a good pick at around $85. Still, while there is little immediate cause for concern with SHOP stock, its high valuation makes it susceptible to negative developments. This conclusion is based on comparing Shopify’s valuation with its operational performance in recent years and its financial standing. Our analysis across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience reveals a very strong operating profile. For those seeking returns with reduced volatility, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio offers a compelling alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception.
