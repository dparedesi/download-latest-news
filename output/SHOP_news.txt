Anything under 240 hurts my eyes Less than 480hz gives me headaches anything less than 960hz makes me throwup @Sr1993e: The human eye can't see beyond 30fps /s -1 “Enjoy a 1-year warranty”, too short to enjoy. I like your website - Mostly Melbourne. Mostly. Why buy this when the Iniu P63 is 25000mAh, 100W, 400g and $80? Inu looks like it would have pouch cells versus this looks like it has cylindrical cells. Cylindrical cells can be safer. Safer but bigger, heavier and possibly more loss due to heat All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.
