Don't miss out on this fantastic deal! Grab yours today! Is this better then the anker737? Dunno, I'd rather just stick to my 90W charging on Xiaomi phone at the moment. There will always be a use case for power banks, but have to wonder if their utility will be diminished now that we're entering the age of silicon carbide batteries for devices I heard new battery tech is using nuclear? https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/nuclear-battery-betavolt-… At this point you'd need thousands of these to have even a chance to run a phone. Their output power is in the pico watt range. I assume you mean Silicon carbide lithium-ion batteries ? I'm not sure how they will diminish the need for on th go charging. This Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI offers advantages over the Anker 737, including higher total output power (212W vs 140W) and faster charging speeds (up to 120W). Fomo! grab it now:) we offer 7-day change of mind on our amazon shop Does it function like a UPS similar to the Xiaomi ZMI No.20? yes, it does Apparently the 120W maximum USB-A output requires a Xiaomi 6A Type-C fast charging cable. Is such a cable included in this package? This package include a USB-C to USB-C cable with E-marker, rated at 100W capacity. The 120W output would require a compatible Xiaomi phone and the cable came with the phone. @Mostly Melbourne: Aw. Last question - is the 100W USB A to C cable that came with the ZMI No. 20 compatible with the USB A output of this power bank? Would definitely buy if it is! Fyi, Just checked these sell for 364 chinese yuan (approx. $80 aud) on Pinduoduo app in HK. (similar to Temu). Free shipping? I think local shipping limited to HK. I had the app installed while traveling there. Bargain at aud80 ! Let me check temu now The product is an item that was previously returned, not in its original packaging, and it does not come with a one-year warranty or a seven-day no-reason return guarantee. Additionally, you need to consider the shipping cost from Hong Kong to Australia. *Slow shipping, its pretty much restricted to; A - Sea Freight B - Designated Courier Aircraft (ie. DHL) which can carry these sorts of batteries Isn't 1 year warranty default? Or are you extending it by 1 more year so it's 2yrs total? Australia customer law is above the manufacturer warranties. There is no default. You make you sell you decide all the features. I can sell something and give 1 hour warranty and free onlyfans account and one carrot cake, but I still have to follow Australian law when someone come in later with broken thing i dunno, what's that onlyfans account you mentioned? I know people will interested on that word only haha @CyberMurning: tell me more about the cake To clarify, Australian Consumer Law isn’t “above” manufacturer warranties. It is unavoidable if you are an Australian “consumer” (there are criteria, but typically, anyone who is not a business) purchasing an item from anyone conducting business in Australia. This includes manufacturers and suppliers. Relevantly, there are a set of “consumer guarantees” (and warranties) which are usually more protective than most business’ typical warranties. Some businesses (example Apple) try to account for this in their standard warranty. Example, most places in the world, Apple products come with a one year warranty. In Australia, it is one extra year by standard (two years). Some other countries have better consumer protections laws and get an even better protection through their local laws. For example, if my 2.5 year old $3,000 MacBook Pro has a serious fault, like a series of dead pixels, or a seriously degraded battery (not normal wear and tear, but perhaps down to 50% max capacity), that would be considered a serious fault and a product that costs that much shouldn’t fail within 2.5 years. Big businesses like Apple (or a supplier like JB Hi-Fi) will typically honour this and replace the item no questions asked (although they could also opt to repair or reimburse). Other businesses have the same obligations but sometimes it is like drawing water from stone. The guarantee is proportionate to the price paid. Maybe can’t expect a $400 laptop to last 3.5 years. It’s all a grey area and difficult to enforce. Definitely worthwhile being across the consumer warranties and protections, remedies etc. try looking up a brochure or leaflet on ACL or ask ChatGPT some questions, or flick through the legislation. I know but they clearly state above "Hurry! This introductory price and extended warranty are limited to the first batch, and it's first-come, first-served!" but they don't mention how long they extended it. So i was just wanting clarification on that. Thank you for your reminder. We have corrected the original text. "Warranty year" refers to one year, and we apologize for the previous incorrect statement. So based on the calculation below (thanks, ChatGPT), can i assume this is safe to be brought along for overseas travel since it's below the 100Wh travel rule? The Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI has: • Capacity: 25,000mAh • Voltage: Typically 3.63V (common for lithium-ion cells) (25000 \times 3.63) \div 1000 = 90.8Wh Or you can just click the Xiaomi website link provided by op and it'll tell you: *Suitable for air travel: This product contains five 5,000mAh battery cells with a rated capacity of 14,000mAh (5V/6A) and a battery power of 90.8Wh. According to the International Aviation Standard, power banks with less than 100Wh power are permitted on airplanes. Yes, that's correct, 90.8Wh, and it has clear labeling to ensure you can pass through security when you board the plane Just bought the Zmi hmmm… should I have waited? The ZMI QB826G is a product validated by thousands of buyers in the market. The Xiaomi product has some functional updates and different dimensions compared to the QB826G, which is why we are offering a significant discount to promote it in the market.
