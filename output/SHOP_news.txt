Justine Moore and Alex Rampell The internet’s most profitable business model has always been simple: running search ads on monetizable queries. When you search “how many protons are in a cesium atom,” Google makes no money. When you search “best tennis racket,” it prints cash. This asymmetry defines the entire search economy–some queries are pure curiosity, and others have direct purchase intent. It’s part of why Google (where people often search for products) is a $2T company and Wikipedia (where people search for knowledge or fun facts) is a non-profit. Google could lose 95% of search volume and still grow revenue –as long as it retains the valuable queries, which are largely commerce related. Has Google managed to keep these searches from moving to AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity? Maybe. In May 2025, Apple SVP Eddy Cue testified during the DOJ’s antitrust trial that Safari search volume had declined for the first time in over two decades. The result? Alphabet’s stock dropped nearly 8% in a day, wiping out over $150 billion in market cap — all from the hint that queries might be leaking to AI. But fast forward to Google’s increasing revenue (including from search!) and it’s pretty clear (squaring Eddy Cue’s comments with Google’s Q2 earnings) that Google is likely only losing low-monetizing queries, at least for now. AI is eating the low-value (at least in “cost-per-click terms”) queries first, the ones with no commercial intent that are more informational. If language models answer your cesium question, Google loses the query but not a dime. The revenue remains until AI starts replacing things like “best X for Y” commerce journeys — the ones with actual purchase intent. There’s no question this is about to happen, but not all commerce is the same. Some commerce will be eaten by AI, some will be immune to it, and some will be up for grabs by new startups. We can split purchases into five rough categories, ordered by level of consideration: There’s a sixth category here that we won’t cover in detail in this post, because the purchase behavior is idiosyncratic. This is aspirational purchases – things you dream about buying once you get that promotion, or that you spend months (or years) saving up for. Depending on your income level, these purchases could be many things: a luxury handbag, a sports car, a vacation home. Each of these journeys is likely different. But it’s possible that AI agents help a consumer pick the exact SKU they want to buy or track prices / availability. How will AI play a role? We expect that AI will impact each type of purchase – but in vastly different ways. To start, we’ll dive into how shopping behaviors were impacted by the Internet and then speculate on what they might look like in the age of AI. A bit more detail on how AI could impact each category, and early examples of products we’ve seen here: 1. Impulse buys – the nature of an impulse buy means that you won’t be doing research in advance or consulting with an expert, so there’s limited opportunity for AI agents to play a role. However, the algorithms that guide your attention will continue to improve, enabling advertisers to target you with the right product at the right time. And it will be easier for brands to create hyper-personalized marketing materials that draw you in. For example, imagine watching an IG Reel about Mothers’ Day gifts and then immediately getting an ad for a candle engraved with her name. This type of image customization is now simple (and relatively cheap) to do at scale. 2. Routine essentials – you probably already have brands and SKUs that you know and love when it comes to everyday essentials, so an AI research agent won’t be particularly helpful unless you’re adding a new product to the lineup (like if you get a dog and need to pick their food). But AI should play a role when it comes to sourcing and purchasing items. For example, if you regularly get the same laundry detergent, your AI agent could monitor and buy on your behalf if the price dips below a certain level (especially if it knows that based on your past purchase patterns, you’ll need new detergent in the next few weeks). Tools like camelcamelcamel allow you to set price watches on Amazon products and notify you if there’s a great deal. The next step of this could be agentic purchasing on your behalf, particularly across retailers. 3. Lifestyle purchases – when you’re purchasing items that you don’t buy regularly (especially if they’re a bit more spendy, like a luxury handbag), you’re likely going to want to evaluate various options to make sure you’re picking the best one. But researching and aggregating the choices, and ranking them across various criteria, is time-consuming. Imagine deputizing an AI agent to do the grunt work for you and come back with a recommendation that explains why a specific SKU is the perfect choice for you based on your past purchases, what it knows about your preferences, and even things like your body type and what colors look best with your eyes. We’re starting to see early examples of this with products like Plush, which enables you to search for women’s fashion items, but we expect to see tools here that do deeper research across more options. 4. Functional purchases – these items are important because they are typically (1) a meaningful financial investment, and (2) a product you’ll use every day, likely over several years. This means that you want to feel very confident that the product meets your needs and will hold up over time. You may feel comfortable purchasing a product that your AI research agent recommends. But you’ll likely want to have a more in-depth conversation with a subject-matter expert (an AI “consultant”) about different options, with a phone or video call that allows you to explain your needs in further detail and answer follow-up questions. Some retailers / brands offer this on their website already, but it’s limited to their SKUs. We see an opportunity for AI consultants that have deep knowledge on a product category across different brands, and that learn more context on each user and their preferences over time (for example, if it helps you buy a sofa, it can later tailor chair recommendations to things that match). 5. Life purchases – there are only a few “life purchases” you’ll make (e.g. a home, car, wedding, or college education). These are expensive and meaningful, so you’ll likely spend months – if not years – evaluating options. You’ll do your own research online, but there’s a decent chance that you’ll also speak with experts and try out the options (e.g. touring wedding venues or homes, test driving a car, visiting a college). It’s hard to imagine people fully outsourcing these decisions to AI. But it’s likely that an AI coach will guide you through the process of choosing – from researching the initial set of options to evaluating the pros & cons to negotiating terms or reviewing contracts (we already see founders sending us term sheets marked up by Claude). You may have noticed a few categories of spend that we largely aren’t included in our examples here: food, travel, and healthcare. Food and travel vary by person, so it’s hard to bucket them into one category. For one person, a nice meal at a restaurant or a weekend trip is a routine purchase that doesn’t require meaningful research. For another, it’s a splurge (and an opportunity for an AI research agent to play a role). Due to the fact that most healthcare expenses are largely out of a person’s control, it’s a bit more complicated to categorize them. We’ll leave this to another post, but suffice it to say that there’s no shortage of opportunities to direct patients to better treatments / doctors / procedures with AI. Google isn’t the only major commerce platform that could be disrupted by AI. Amazon and Shopify are also at risk – but they sit much closer to the point of purchase than Google. They monetize not just intent but action, and increasingly, repeat behavior. Amazon owns search, delivery, reorder data, and (quite importantly) reviews. It is an integrated commerce stack. While search can effectively disintermediate Amazon, Amazon itself serves as a search engine for commerce with an embedded loyalty program (Amazon Prime) boasting hundreds of millions of subscribers. Shopify powers the merchant side: hosting SKUs, facilitating checkout, and enabling direct-to-consumer brands. Through Shop Pay and the Shop App, it’s now building a consumer-side wedge too. As agents become the new interface for buying, both platforms are well-positioned — Amazon with end-to-end control, Shopify perhaps more so with distributed ownership across millions of stores and growing consumer touchpoints. It doesn’t matter if a consumer search starts with Google or ChatGPT if the destination merchant is hosted by Shopify. Google could, of course, use its considerable distribution and technical prowess (not to mention “payment credential” prowess with GooglePay) to play offense, purposefully routing more commerce searches in an AI first way, or even making a “CamelCamelCamel x AI” new purchasing app. AI agents can’t fulfill their potential in commerce without major shifts in the substrate they operate on. In particular: 1. Better data: AI’s potential is first and foremost bottlenecked by content, not compute. Most product reviews are noisy, gamed, or overly polarized. Agents need access to structured, trustworthy, real-time feedback. Let’s say you’re looking for the “best” blender. In a perfect world, your AI would order every blender, test them all for a week in your kitchen (with your home robot!), decide which one you like best, and then send the rest back. But today AI just summarizes the web, and cannot turn shilled junk into honest analysis. 2. Unified APIs: To move from recommendations to transactions, agents must be able to interface cleanly across retail platforms. This starts with agents being able to pull accurate data on products (like the most up-to-date price and what’s in stock), and extends to being able to add things to cart and eventually checking out on the user’s behalf. 3. Identity and memory: Agents that understand your preferences, past purchases, and deal thresholds (a la CamelCamelCamel) can automate routine buying and curate lifestyle decisions. This is an interesting challenge, because preferences change over time and also vary by type of purchase – for example, you might like to splurge on flights but want to buy lower-price daily essentials. Or you might frequently return cotton sweaters but never their wool counterparts. So this memory must be dynamic and multi-faceted. 4. Embedded capture: The best AI-native experiences will capture data directly in the user journey that contributes to better recommendations. Imagine an AI agent that infers information about what to recommend to you (or others) from data that’s not typically present on product description pages or reviews. This could be direct (e.g. next time you open the app, it asks you a few specific questions about your last purchase), or more passive (e.g. it looks at how long you linger on a specific item or feature and maybe even asks follow-ups if you’re hesitating). Until these foundations are in place, LLMs will remain clever summarizers — not true commercial agents.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing. Note: You can’t predict exactly what your customers will ask, and there are infinite ways they can do it. But thinking about prompts — not just keywords — will put you in a good place to be able to optimize your ecommerce pages for LLMs. Think in layers: This is how you start to think of your items like answers and solutions, not just products. Let this prompt structure inform your: LLMs can pull from all of it — so make sure you’re using the kind of language your real customers use everywhere. Even if your site is crawlable, your schema is perfect, and your feed is super optimized — LLMs still learn about your brand based on what people are saying about you elsewhere. They’re trained on massive web-scale datasets, so third-party content — like reviews, Reddit mentions, YouTube transcripts, forums, blog posts — can carry as much (or more) weight than your owned channels. If you want to show up in AI answers, your brand needs to already exist in the wider conversation. AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude all lean on third-party review sites and forums in their answers to brand and product-related queries. These are the places you’ll want to show up in order to be included in those answers: Showing up in these places is half the battle. The other component is how you show up. Ideally, you’ll want to be mentioned alongside competitors (“like Brooklinen but…”). And in the right, relevant context (“these are some of the best cooling sheets for eczema”). A lot of this is going to be completely out of your control (especially on platforms like Reddit). But good marketing practices can make it more likely that people will naturally talk about your brand in the way you want them to. Gaining LLM visibility is a byproduct of an effective multichannel marketing strategy. If you’re running a strong content program, building brand awareness, and actively participating in your category — you’re already seeding relevance. What’s new is the urgency: LLMs are already using these signals to decide which brands deserve to be recommended. Related: See our LLM Seeding Playbook for tactics, templates, and outreach strategies. In traditional SEO, visibility was deterministic: rank #1 for a keyword, get X% of clicks. That model is breaking. AI-powered discovery works differently. Your brand might appear in one version of a response, but not the next. Whether your ecommerce store is included depends on how the user phrases their prompt, how much brand recognition you have, and how often you’re referenced across the web. So, your measurement strategy needs to adapt. Start by building a prompt library — real questions your customers might ask: Here’s how it looks in Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit: For each prompt, ask: Over time, this gives you a clearer picture of how visible your brand is across different use cases. AI-driven search is already reshaping how people discover products. The shift is subtle now, but it won’t stay that way for long. What used to be a clear SEO vs. paid search strategy is now blending into a broader question: When someone asks a smart machine what to buy… will it know you exist? This guide gave you a playbook to start answering that question: It’s a lot. But the good news? If you’ve already invested in great products, strong messaging, and a multi-channel strategy, you’re not starting from scratch. Still need help nailing the fundamentals?
