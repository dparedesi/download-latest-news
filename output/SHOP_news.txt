Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily A spike in online shopping and sufficient turnouts in the malls, outlets and urban shopping districts over Black Friday weekend portend a healthy stretch ahead in the days leading to Christmas. So far, so good. After weeks of early discounting culminating on Black Friday, U.S. retailers saw enough gift shopping over the weekend to buoy hopes of meeting or beating their holiday sales goals. While traffic in stores on Black Friday and Saturday was slightly down to flat from a year ago, online traffic was robust. As consumers got into the holiday spending spirit, demand overcame inflation and cost of living concerns, at least temporarily. Purchasing on Friday and Saturday was also driven by the strong stock market, where on Friday the Dow closed at a record 44,910.65 points; less uncertainty due to the presidential election being decided, and weather conditions conducive to hitting the malls. Temperature drops on Friday and Saturday spurred sales of outerwear and winter accessories, which lagged through the fall; activewear also fared well. Retailers are generally managing inventories better, and utilizing AI more to gauge demand and generate flash sales.

Globally, Cyber Monday is seen driving $51 billion in online sales, up from $48.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, Salesforce said. The software giant also reported that during the first half of Cyber Week, retailers using GenAI in their service experience saw a 9 percent higher conversion rate compared to retailers who are not. Another software giant, Adobe, reported that on Black Friday U.S. consumers spent a $10.8 billion online, up 10.2 percent year-over-year. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., $11.3 million was spent online every minute on Black Friday, with toys, jewelry, appliances, personal care, apparel and electronics among the top-performing categories, Adobe reported. “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored toward in-store shopping,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “And with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chatbots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth moving forward.” Mastercard reported that U.S. store and online sales on Black Friday, excluding automotive sales and unadjusted for inflation, were up 3.4 percent. “Black Friday was a good indicator of how the holiday season is positively shaping up,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Our real-time insights show that consumers are comfortably in the gift-giving spirit as price reductions and deals occur across sectors, supporting budgets for holiday shopping.” Mastercard indicated that online retail sales on Black Friday increased 14.6 percent, while in-store sales were up just 0.7 percent, compared to Black Friday last year. Jewelry, electronics and apparel were cited as the top categories, with particular strength in apparel e-commerce. “Shoppers are making the most of seasonal deals and enjoying a balance of experiences spending and gifts for all loved ones,” said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard and former chairman and chief executive officer of Saks Inc. “They’re more strategic in their shopping, though, prioritizing promotions that they believe hold the greatest value — opening their wallets, but with more intentional distribution.” “Black Friday is no longer a day. It’s a season,” said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger, the Greensboro, N.C.-based operator of 39 outlet centers and one lifestyle center. “The traffic starts building in late October/early November, and Tanger has been promoting Black Friday every day in November with different brands and sales to keep things exciting. Our traffic numbers this weekend beat last year. People are shopping in large groups. The whole family is coming out and shoppers are looking for deals.” Coach, Ralph Lauren, Columbia, American Eagle, Aerie, Viori, Nike, Adidas and Gap Inc. were among the busiest outlets in Tanger centers over the weekend, Yalof said. Asked if the deals were bigger this year than last year, Yalof replied, “I think so. The discounting started earlier this year than last year and a lot of the brands in some instances have better deals than last year, and on selected items. Yeti was on sale. I’ve never seen Yeti on sale.” The consumer mindset, he said, is to “shop now and come in early” for fear that a particular product would sell out. “There’s a frenzied-ness I haven’t seen in recent years. I think it’s fueled by the shorter selling season and the weather just turning cold.” Data from major software firms indicated that traffic at stores are down slightly from last year, but Yalof said, “Outlets are a different story. I visited a couple of full-price centers also and there were plenty of cars there, but the aspirational outlet shopper is looking for deals and they are lining up in our centers.” “Everything we got from our malls is really positive,” said Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based real estate investment trust, when asked to comment on Friday’s and Saturday’s business. “We had really good crowds early. The stores offering good promotions had lines. The parking lots were full by mid-morning and stayed busy all day Friday.” Lebovitz said the Wednesday before Thanksgiving saw a stronger turnout than the same day a year ago. “People were hitting it hard given the short holiday season.” Each year there’s typically a lull in business after Cyber Monday until 10 days to two weeks before Christmas. “Because of the shorter calendar, we don’t think there will be as much of a lull this year,” Lebovitz said. Stores selling activewear, casual apparel and cosmetics, and those offering promotions and good discounts fared the best, Lebovitz said, noting that consumers have been hit by “a barrage of emails and texts” from retailers. CBL has a total of 94 malls, and outlet, lifestyle and open-air centers, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. “Things were good, not great,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. He said the weekend marked a return to shopping “normalcy” in the aftermath of COVID-19 and the subsequent spending splurge from federal assistance putting money into consumers’ pockets. Americans, Johnson said, are “shopping with a balance of wants and needs.” Johnson said transaction velocity was highest at Costco, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Inc. and Urban Outfitters. Category-wise, athleisure was a standout, with Lululemon, Viori, Alo and Free People performing well in the category, Johnson said. He also said that the promotional pace has been quite similar to last year, with discounts typically offering 30 percent off, with some up to 40 percent and select goods at the 50 percent mark. Almost all the retail promotions so far have been pre-planned. “There has not been any fire-sale pricing,” Johnson said. At Elyse Walker, which operates six Elyse Walker designer stores and two Towne specialty stores, “Black Friday was a very healthy kick-off to holiday shopping,” said Summer Holl, president. “While we ran a Black Friday weekend promo that drove motivated traffic — additional 20 percent off markdown in store and online — we had a great mix of full-price selling and appointments as well. Our Los Angeles flagship was up triple digits to Black Friday last year and we saw a 10 percent comp increase in our New York City flagship. Footwear, both sale and full price, was a top seller. Shoppers were looking for buy now, wear now deals, knits and outerwear. Full-price selling was driven by new designer deliveries from Celine, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Khaite and Altuzarra.” “I’m beyond happy,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, which operates 89 stores across the U.S. as well as a robust online business. “It was amazing.” He said the company launched its planned promotional sale a week early this year and was worried that the aggressive stance of some competitors might take a bite out of Untuckit’s business. That turned out not to be the case. “We held the same discount as we have for the past 13 years,” Riccobono said, with select items being offered at 50 and 60 percent off regular retail. “We comped up pretty significantly both in our stores and online. They’re not always in sync, but in this case, it was pretty even . . . . Everything was great last week — maybe [consumers] were just waiting for the election to end.” Bestsellers included the men’s wrinkle-free Veneto shirt program, Hemsworth flannel shirt, wrinkle-free Cadetto shirt, the Lawrence and Cord shirts, the Archer sweater flannel and the Traveler pant program. While Untuckit is primarily a men’s brand, the women’s Bella program and the Lexie Sequin shirtdress were top performers. Commenting on the business ahead, Riccobono said, “It’s held for eight days in a row so we feel like it’ll be a great holiday season.” “Our full-price retail was strong the last month and we experienced the same trend during Black Friday,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. The company’s stores and e-commerce performed similarly well. “They were neck and neck,” he said, “And we have significantly less clearance than last year. We’re pretty clean and our gross margin and maintained margin are up, so we’re feeling good.” As a result, the company moved some dollars previously spent on affiliate marketing to more traditional advertising such as billboards, television and out-of-home ads. “It’s helping us,” he said. Among the top sellers were “holiday dressing” pieces and formalwear, which were the focus in this year’s holiday campaign. Elevated sportswear in sweaters and knits also did well. Despite the compressed calendar, Ohashi expects the strong performance to continue through December. “The stores that we recently expanded or are in new markets all performed very well,” he said, pointing to the larger Rockefeller Center store in New York City, as well as the Wisconsin Avenue unit in Washington, D.C., and Newbury Street in Boston. “They all performed well,” he said. “Newbury Street, in particular, has been on fire and four out of five people there have never shopped with us before.” As a result, Ohashi said he’s “not stressed going into the first quarter in terms of inventory,” and believes 2025 will also be strong for Brooks Brothers. Rhone had a strong holiday kickoff, too. “We had record-setting days in all channels,” said CEO Nate Checketts, who hit stores this weekend in Boston while his cofounder and brother Ben hit stores in Los Angeles. He said that in addition to strength in a new menswear product called the Coldspell Commuter Pant, which features a brushed flannel lining for warmth, Rhone was pleased with the performance of its recently launched women’s collection. “We saw higher ‘mixed baskets,’ of people buying both men’s and women’s,” Checketts said. Rhone stuck to its planned promotions of 30 percent off on orders of $300 or more. “We’ve run the same promotions for the last four years and we did the same this year,” he said. “Consumers are starting to come back in a stronger way after a year of uncertainty and a post-election cycle. It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season. Bob Mitchell, co-CEO of Mitchells Stores, which operates luxury units under the Mitchells, Richards, Wilkes Bashford and Marios names on the East and West Coasts, said that despite Thanksgiving being a week later than last year, business in 2024 is very strong. “We just capped off a record, double-digit November and we’re off to a double-digit start for the holiday season,” he said. “Men’s has come on strong in the last few weeks,” particularly tailored clothing — especially sport coats — and sportswear. New spring deliveries have also started to check, he said. In women’s, “while ready-to-wear is up, we’re also seeing nice growth in handbags and jewelry, which has been the star.” Top luxury performers at Mitchells Stores were Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Canali, Akris and The Row while Fedeli and Baldessari did well in the mid-tier. Although reluctant to characterize the season as a success this early, Mitchell is upbeat. “The real numbers don’t start for us until 10 days before, so this could all be a mirage,” he said with a laugh. “But the customer is in a very good mood with how the [stock] market is performing and Bitcoin. So we expect it will be a good season.” Shopify merchants saw $5 billion in Black Friday sales this year, up 22 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. Sales peaked at $4.6 million per minute at 12:01 p.m. EST on Friday and the average cart carried $111.12 worth of goods, driven by sales of tops, cosmetics, fitness and nutrition, pants and activewear. Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants. Target stores opened at 6 a.m. on Black Friday, but shoppers in some places started lining up as early as 11:30 the night before. The big-box store sought to draw consumers with Taylor Swift exclusives, including “The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,” as well as versions of her album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on CD and vinyl. As some locations sold out of at least part of their Taylor Swift goodies by 10 a.m., Target looked to steer the traffic to other parts of the store with discounts, including 40 percent off for fleece and 50 percent off for some women’s, kids and men’s looks. At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: We uncovered 57 online clothing shops trying to scam Australians. And they’re just the tip of the iceberg

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.
