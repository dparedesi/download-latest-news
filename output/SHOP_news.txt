You’ve probably been on the customer side of the Square Online e-commerce platform many times, whether tapping your card on a Square terminal in a coffee shop or buying items from an online store. Square is just as easy to use on the business side. You can start selling products within minutes of signing up, and the service's many store customization options, handy photo editing app, unlimited storage and bandwidth, social media integrations, and robust video tutorials make it easy to recommend. However, Square Online has one weak spot compared with the competition: Its 24/7 customer support is paywalled behind its most expensive tier. Our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce, Shopify and Wix Stores, pull slightly ahead with their around-the-clock customer service across all plans. Square has three e-commerce tiers: Free, Plus, and Premium. The Free tier is good if you want to test the e-commerce waters and don't mind the inability to apply your company's brand. Free subscribers get SEO tools, and the ability to sync with Square POS terminals, sell on social media, and accept card payments. However, Free lacks Square’s robust website themes, meaning you're locked to its default aesthetic. Strangely, Free subscribers cannot set item quantity limits, so a single customer can clear your stock. Despite Square’s Free tier being fairly lightweight regarding features, it stands apart from the competition by simply existing. The cheapest tiers for Shopify and Wix start at $29 and $27, respectively, per month. Neither has a free version. Next is the Plus tier, which costs $29 per month. This plan lets you leverage Square's website design tools and themes to give your online shop a unique visual identity. In addition, you can create customer accounts, whip up QR codes for items like menus and pre-orders, or create subscriptions. Helpful analytics and statistics are available when you need a deep dive into sales data. Building upon Plus, the Premium tier costs $79 per month and offers real-time shipping rates. It's also the tier where the walled-off 24/7 customer support kicks in (more on that in a bit). Premium has unlimited storage and monthly data transfers like every other Square tier. Square charges 2.9% and 30 cents per transaction. The Premium tier drops the rate to 2.6% plus 20 cents per transaction. You can sample the Free plan using Square's 14-day trial. However, the trial isn't available with paid plans unless you do a workaround by signing up for Free and then upgrading. The trial requires you to keep a credit card on file. Once you select a tier and create login credentials, Square asks basic questions to determine how your customers receive their orders (shipping via Square, pickup, or in-house delivery). After that, Square presents its dashboard. This dashboard is sleek and easy to navigate. In a nice touch, it has a video tutorial checklist that walks you through the packing, shipping, and customization options. I appreciated that the tutorials were front and center. Plus and Premium members can build their websites using templates. Once you select one, you can customize the website for web and mobile use. You can apply different fonts and colors, add drop shadows to your buttons, and round out the corners of your windows—it all gets pretty granular. The stock template options are attractive, but it's good to know you can tailor them to your brand's specificities. The most important feature of an e-commerce platform is the ability to upload items to your stock. Square Online makes this a breeze. Clicking the Items tab takes you to your backend catalog, where you can add digital and physical items to your shop. Photo Studio by Square is a companion app for iOS devices (it lacks an Android version). It's included with your subscription and is useful for snapping product photos. You can easily photograph an item, remove the background, change the background to a preset image, and even add effects like a drop shadow. Afterward, simply add the product's price and description, and upload the data to the online store. Photo Studio and Square Online sync almost instantly. Although it's not an Adobe Photoshop replacement, the app does the job if you don't need studio-quality images. That said, a cheap lightbox and an iPhone can take you a long way. Square accepts all major credit cards, Square gift cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The e-commerce platform also accepts Square POS, a system that simplifies importing orders, items, and inventory. In addition, Square Online has an application programming interface (API), so developers can create third-party add-ons outside the Square App Marketplace. If you don't want to do that, the Square App Marketplace contains dozens of apps in 16 categories, including Accounting, Booking & Scheduling, and Loyalty & Rewards. Website uptime is one of the most important aspects of an online store. If your site is down, clients or customers cannot find you or access your products or services. Square strives for 100% guaranteed uptime, but the company acknowledges it's an impossible promise. To mitigate this, Square offers transparency by letting you know when outages occur. Subscribers can sign up for downtime alerts, and Square's hardware lets you accept payments in an offline mode. Square also has a website, isSquareUp.com, that lets you check for outages. If you’re having an issue with your online store, you need help quickly. Square Online has customer support, but you can only access its phone lines from Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT, if you have the Free or Plus plans. You can contact Square via email (the company's website says a response may take 24 to 48 hours) or web chat (which leverages a bot to answer questions outside of phone support hours). If you have the Premium tier, you can access 24/7 customer support. It's good that perk exists for those who pony up, but I'd like to see all subscribers receive this benefit. Shopify and Wix Stores have that, after all. With user-friendly features that empower you tailor your online store to your exact specifications, Square Online is an attractive service for any business. It's an especially easy sell if you're already invested in the Square ecosystem. The main drawback is limited customer service hours unless you subscribe to the Premium tier. Thanks to 24/7 customer support with every tier, Shopify and Wix Stores inch past Square to remain our Editors' Choice winners.

Title: Investors await new inflation data amid tariff concerns: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%. In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked. But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board. On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings. The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported. This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs. "The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. "This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate." Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy. On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs. Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option. In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook. "While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level," Rieder wrote. With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior. The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December. With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January. While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations. The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was "in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy." Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.
