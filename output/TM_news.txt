We recently compiled a list of the 8 Companies That Partnered With Nvidia (NVDA) This Month. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) stands against the other stocks that partnered with NVIDIA this month. Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the rampant spending on AI infrastructure. The company’s Blackwell GPUs continue to be the most talked about technology in tech circles and that has catapulted the stock close to its all-time highs. For many, the stock continues to be an expensive bet and at current levels, it is hard to pull the trigger and invest in the company's stock. If you’re in the same boat and find it hard to buy a stock at its all-time highs, you may want to consider investing in companies that work with Nvidia. Nvidia’s accelerated computing technologies are powering many companies' products, especially those related to AI and autonomy. Workers assembling a car in a modern manufacturing plant, emphasizing the company's sense of progress. Toyota has a strong history of partnerships with Nvidia. Continuing that tradition, the car maker announced a new collaboration with the semiconductor giant. The firm’s upcoming vehicles will feature automated driving powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin Supercomputer and DriveOS operating system. The Drive AGX supercomputer can process sensor data in real-time, which the DriveOS can then also process in real-time. This AI processing is expected to offer automated driving features that will take Toyota closer to achieving autonomy on roads. The plan to put Nvidia’s supercomputer in Toyota vehicles was thought of nearly 7 years ago. Since then, Nvidia has helped Toyota by offering automation through the cloud. The collaboration now moves to offering the same through an in-car system, which should massively improve the efficiency of the system. Toyota has been struggling to deal with potential tariffs, eroding margins due to labor costs, and a price war in China. Investors would hope the Nvidia partnership will help the company tackle these challenges. Overall TM ranks 4th on our list of the companies that partnered with NVIDIA this month. While we acknowledge the potential of TM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
