(NASDAQ: RKLB), a prominent player in launch services and space systems, has announced the completion of testing and integration of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc. The spacecraft is designed to support Varda's mission of pharmaceutical processing and hypersonic Earth re-entry logistics in space. The first Pioneer spacecraft for Varda was launched in June 2023, and it successfully crystallized the HIV drug Ritonavir in orbit. The resulting re-entry capsule was recovered in the Utah desert in February 2024.

The Pioneer spacecraft, constructed at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, is equipped to provide power, communications, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda's 120 kg reentry capsule. Rocket Lab's vertically integrated approach to spacecraft production utilizes in-house components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, and radios. Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, emphasized the benefits of the collaboration, stating that it enables the creation of high-value products in microgravity and their return to Earth. Will Bruey, CEO and co-founder of Varda, highlighted the partnership's role in advancing the orbital economy and the significance of each reentry as a step towards routine space operations. The Pioneer spacecraft is a configurable medium delta-V platform capable of supporting large payloads and dynamic space operations.
