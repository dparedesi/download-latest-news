October 14, 2025 14:26 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Oct. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 15th mission of the year and the first of 21 new launches for Synspective. The “Owl New World” mission launched on Electron from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 16:33 UTC on October 14 to deploy the seventh StriX satellite to a 583km low Earth orbit. The mission was the first of a series of 21 dedicated Electron launches to take place between now and the end of the decade for Synspective, a leading Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data and analytics company from Japan. It was also the seventh Electron mission completed for Synspective since launches to deploy their constellation began in December 2020. Altogether, Rocket Lab will launch 27 missions for Synspective, making Electron the primary launcher of their constellation. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “Another Electron launch for Synspective with 100% mission success, and a fantastic start to an exciting run of upcoming launches to deploy their constellation. Precise, direct access to orbit is essential to the iteration and growth of constellations already in space, and I’m proud of the Rocket Lab team for delivering this again and again for Synspective across every launch.” Synspective founder and CEO, Dr. Motoyuki Arai, said: “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at Rocket Lab for safely and successfully carrying out this mission, as well as to all the members of Synspective who made this achievement possible. Moving forward, we will continue to leverage our satellite and data analytics technologies to address global challenges, such as security, disaster management, and environmental sustainability, thereby contributing to the creation of a more resilient and sustainable future.” Electron’s unbeaten combination of reliability, rapid execution, and exceptional satellite deployment accuracy in the space industry’s commercial small-lift launch class has made it the favored rocket for constellation operators globally. Rocket Lab is expected to surpass its previous annual launch record achieved in 2024 with 16 launches, with scheduled missions for other commercial constellation operators and international space agencies in the coming weeks that are set to meet the Company’s forecast of 20+ launches in 2025.
