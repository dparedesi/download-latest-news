For those looking for a more consistent option, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio —up 91% since its inception—has regularly outperformed the S&P 500. See earnings reaction history of all stocks. Additional data on observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation and implementing the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) trended lower following the company's announcement to raise $750 million through equity dilution. This move, which increases the total number of shares, often concerns investors because it can negatively impact a company's earnings per share. The key question is the extent of the downside risk for RKLB stock. Despite its recent decline, the stock still appears overvalued. This overvaluation, combined with the stock’s history of only modest rebounds after previous drops, suggests there is considerable risk. Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for RKLB, see Buy or Sell RKLB Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it is crucial to determine if the situation deteriorates significantly, leading to an additional drop of 20-30% to the $33 level, and whether we will be able to retain the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Below is an in-depth analysis of Rocket Lab’s downturn resilience – particularly, its performance in comparison to the market during previous crises. It turns out that the stock experienced an impact that was slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) how swiftly it recovered. Below are the specifics, but before that, as a brief background: RKLB offers launch services, small orbital vehicles, and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government space and defense sectors. Overall, Rocket Lab (RKLB) stock has a history of experiencing significant declines during broader market corrections. While the company has generated investor interest through its successful rocket launches and new contracts—especially for its upcoming Neutron rocket—investors should also be mindful of the potential downside risk. Concerned that RKLB may decline further? You may want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have historically comfortably outperformed its benchmark, which comprises the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What is the reason for this?
