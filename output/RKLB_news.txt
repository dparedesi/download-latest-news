The newly delivered spacecraft, designated W-3, will be instrumental in Varda's next orbital manufacturing and hypersonic reentry mission. Earlier this month, W-2 was launched and is currently operational in orbit, carrying payloads from the Air Force Research Laboratory and NASA's Ames Research Center. W-2's mission is focused on expanding Varda's pharmaceutical processing capabilities in microgravity before reentering and landing in South Australia. Built upon Rocket Lab's Pioneer platform, W-3 integrates a range of advanced, vertically integrated spacecraft components, including propulsion systems, flight software, avionics, reaction wheels, star trackers, separation mechanisms, solar panels, radios, composite structures, and propellant tanks. The spacecraft is designed to provide critical power, communication, propulsion, and attitude control for Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule, which leverages the unique environment of microgravity to produce materials and products that are challenging or impossible to manufacture on Earth. Upon completion of its in-orbit production phase, Rocket Lab and Varda will execute a series of operations to guide the spacecraft through reentry, landing, and capsule recovery at the Koonibba Test Range in Australia, managed by Southern Launch. "Delivering W-3 while W-2 is actively operating in orbit demonstrates our team's exceptional ability to manage multiple complex missions in parallel. It really highlights the skill of our team and the strength of our integrated spacecraft technologies," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda Space Industries, added, "By increasing the cadence of manufacture, launch, and reentry, we are building the foundation for a thriving orbital economy. Our goal is to decrease the time between missions until it's commonplace for capsules to bring products made in space back to people on Earth." The W-3 mission is slated for launch no earlier than March from VSFB. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is finalizing the fourth and final spacecraft for Varda at its Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

"This launch represents a major inflection point for our global defense and intelligence customer base as BlackSky introduces very high-resolution Gen-3 capabilities to our high-frequency, low-latency monitoring constellation," said Brian O'Toole, BlackSky CEO. "As more Gen-3 satellites complete production, we expect a regular cadence of additional launches over the coming year." Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle will deploy the Gen-3 satellite, continuing the long-standing collaboration between the two companies. "Electron is a trusted and reliable constellation builder for companies like BlackSky, allowing them to be in control of how, when, and where to deploy their constellation," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "BlackSky is one of our earliest and longest-standing commercial satellite customers, and it's great to be heading back to the pad with them once again to continue to advance and expand their constellation." The ongoing deployment of Gen-3 satellites will enhance BlackSky's constellation, ensuring greater imaging capacity and operational flexibility. With these upgrades, BlackSky customers will be able to leverage automated tools for detecting, identifying, and classifying various objects of interest, including vehicles, aircraft, and vessels. These capabilities are designed to support a broad range of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations for tactical and strategic applications.

The mission, designated "IOT 4 You and Me," launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 9:43 AM NZDT on 9 February (20:43 UTC), placing the five satellites into a 647 km low Earth orbit. This launch represents Rocket Lab's first Electron mission of 2025, and the fourth dedicated mission for Kineis, bringing the total Electron launches to 59. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, commented: "That's four launches completed, and just one more to go for Kineis. We'll have their entire constellation deployed in less than a year-a remarkable achievement in itself. Many constellation operators experience longer delays for their first launches, let alone a complete constellation in operation. Once again, Electron proves to be a reliable, precise launcher, enabling our customers to customize their mission plans and timelines." Michel Sarthou, CTO of Kineis, added: "Achieving the production of 25 nanosatellites and launching them into orbit within eight months is an extraordinary accomplishment. With this fourth launch, Kineis is a step closer to providing full global IoT coverage through our constellation of 25 nanosatellites. This milestone reflects the expertise and dedication of our team and our partners like Rocket Lab. We are deeply appreciative of the support we've received since Kineis was founded." The Kineis constellation aims to enable connectivity and real-time data transmission from the most remote parts of the globe, all while consuming minimal energy and maintaining low bit-rate communication. The constellation will support a range of applications, including forest fire monitoring, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network oversight, and transportation logistics tracking. Kineis is now one launch away from completing its constellation. The date for the fifth mission in this series will be revealed in the upcoming weeks. The next Electron mission, scheduled for later in February, will be announced with customer details and the specific launch window shortly.
