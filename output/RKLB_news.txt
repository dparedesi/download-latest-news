"Gen-3 represents a transformative leap forward for space-based intelligence, combining very high-resolution imagery with high frequency monitoring," said Brian O'Toole, BlackSky CEO. "When combined with BlackSky Spectra, the Gen-3 constellation is designed to deliver data at sub-hourly, mission-relevant speeds. We look forward to the inaugural launch and introducing the advanced features of our Gen-3 satellites to our customers." The Gen-3 satellite program is specifically tailored to meet rising demand from global defense and intelligence sectors. "BlackSky has developed Gen-3 to address significant demand from key defense and intelligence customers around the world as evidenced by the significant contracted backlog we have secured for Gen-3 services," added O'Toole. "Once we commission this first satellite, we expect to move forward with a regular cadence of additional launches throughout the year as more Gen-3 satellites come off the production line." The ongoing evolution of BlackSky's constellation will provide enhanced capacity and operational flexibility. The Gen-3 satellites are equipped to perform automated detection, identification, and classification of a broad range of tactical assets, such as vehicles, aircraft, vessels, and other objects of interest. Low-latency intersatellite communication capabilities will allow users to prioritize last-minute tasking and enable high-priority operations. In addition, agile onboard attitude control systems will maximize efficiency during missions. These advancements are set to strengthen BlackSky's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for both tactical and strategic operations, reinforcing its role as a leading provider of space-based intelligence solutions.
