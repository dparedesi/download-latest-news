The MACH-TB program, overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), is a cornerstone of the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0. Its mission is to establish an affordable test bed that bridges the gap between ground-based hypersonic testing and full-scale flight tests. MACH-TB 2.0 aims to expand the nation's hypersonic flight testing capacity with a cost-effective and scalable approach. Under Task Area 1, Kratos holds the prime role in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Testing (SEIT). The company will manage subscale and full-scale systems and provide air launch services to address the growing demand for frequent hypersonic flight tests. Rocket Lab will support the Kratos-led team by offering systems engineering, assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T), as well as mission planning and launch services. Rocket Lab's involvement builds on its proven track record with the MACH-TB program. The company has conducted multiple successful hypersonic test launches using its HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) rocket. These launches took place at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, Virginia. HASTE, a suborbital variant of the Electron launch vehicle, incorporates advanced technology such as carbon fiber composite structures and 3D-printed engines. It also features a modified Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic testing and offers a larger payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Rocket Lab's Vice President of Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, stated: "We're thrilled to be part of the Kratos-led team for the next iteration of the MACH-TB program and ready to serve the U.S. Department of Defense with even more high-cadence hypersonic technology with our HASTE launch vehicle. Our demonstrated ability to date to deliver successful HASTE launches that test these new technologies is testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation alongside our government and industry partners." To date, Rocket Lab's Electron and HASTE vehicles have successfully deployed over 200 payloads from launch sites in the United States and New Zealand, highlighting the company's expertise and reliability in both orbital and suborbital missions.
