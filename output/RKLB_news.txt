ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock has garnered considerable investor interest in 2025, climbing over 150% year-to-date. Trading at about $65, this extraordinary surge reflects an increasing optimism surrounding the company’s Neutron rocket program and its growing involvement in the commercial space sector. Nevertheless, under this excitement lies a valuation dilemma: the company is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 66.5x—more than twenty times the S&P 500’s 3.2x multiple. For investors contemplating entry at these levels, the pivotal question is whether this momentum is supported by fundamentals or primarily fueled by speculation regarding future prospects. Based on traditional valuation metrics, this premium seems challenging to rationalize. We’ll explore the company’s financials in the sections that follow. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like RKLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they avoided the drastic fluctuations, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – How BBAI Stock Rises To $20? The company’s financial profile exposes stark inconsistencies: Despite its unprofitability, Rocket Lab possesses a strong balance sheet that allows them to pursue growth investments: The stock has shown moderate resilience amid market volatility. While it dropped 82.8% during the 2022 inflation crisis (more severe than the S&P 500’s 25.4% decline), it rebounded to pre-crisis levels by November 2024 and has since continued to rise. See more – Buy or Sell RKLB Stock? Our evaluation focuses on past performance and current fundamentals, which suggest RKLB is overvalued. Nonetheless, we may be mistaken in this evaluation, and investors might be inclined to accept a higher valuation multiple for the stock’s future potential, especially concerning the Neutron rocket program. The Neutron rocket signifies a strategic advancement into the medium-lift launch market, potentially positioning the company to compete more effectively with SpaceX’s Falcon 9. If this program succeeds, it could significantly enlarge Rocket Lab’s addressable market and alter its financial dynamics. The company’s solid balance sheet offers the financial endurance to realize this vision without immediate pressure for profitability. That being said, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Rocket Lab is deemed expensive when assessed against present operations—a company losing nearly 46 cents for every dollar of revenue while being valued at 66.5x sales. For investors concentrated on traditional value metrics, this introduces considerable downside risk. Nonetheless, for those who have faith in the company’s technological prowess and the transformative potential of its Neutron program, the existing valuation may signify fair compensation for engaging in the commercial space industry's growth trajectory. Ultimately, the investment decision rests on whether one is acquiring historical performance or prospective opportunities.

October 10, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has signed a direct contract for two dedicated Electron launches with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – signifying the criticality of Electron to international space agencies requiring responsive launch and dedicated access to space. Launching from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, the two Electron missions will deploy satellites for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program. The first launch, scheduled from December 2025, will deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft, a single satellite that will demonstrate eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The second launch, scheduled for 2026, is a JAXA-manifested rideshare of eight separate spacecraft that includes educational small sats, an ocean monitoring satellite, a demonstration satellite for ultra-small multispectral cameras, and a deployable antenna that can be packed tightly using origami folding techniques and unfurled to 25 times its size. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “It’s an incredible honor to be entrusted by JAXA to further their goals of innovation and development for Japan. These missions are a demonstration of Electron’s global importance - supporting the growth of Japan’s space industry with launch on a U.S. rocket from a New Zealand launch site – and we’re proud to be entrusted to deliver them. Japanese satellite operators have long turned to Electron for its reliability and responsiveness since its earliest launches - whether its constellation-building for Japan’s new wave of commercial satellite operators, or bespoke missions requiring responsive mission planning and highly-accurate payload deployment.” Rocket Lab is a launch leader for the Japanese space industry, with more than two dozen dedicated missions booked to fly on Electron through to the end of the decade. These include constellation deployment missions for satellite operators iQPS and Synspective, in addition to the multiple launches already completed this year with 100% mission success. Other successful missions for Japanese satellite operators include the “On Closer Inspection” mission on February 2024 for Astroscale-Japan for the first phase of its orbital debris removal program; and the “Running Out Of Fingers” mission launched in 2019 for Tokyo-based company ALE. Mission information about Rocket Lab’s first launch for JAXA next month will be announced shortly.
