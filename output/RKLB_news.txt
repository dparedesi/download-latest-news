With a market capitalization close to $80 billion, trailing 12-month revenue of $10 billion, $2.4 billion in operating profit, and $1.8 billion in net income, Cintas is decidedly profitable. For traders focused on events, the situation is straightforward: either position in advance of earnings based on historical likelihoods, or await the announcement and trade based on the relationship between short-term movements and medium-term results. For those looking for a more consistent option, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio —up 91% since its inception—has regularly outperformed the S&P 500. See earnings reaction history of all stocks. Additional data on observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation and implementing the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns.
