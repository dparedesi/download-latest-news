January 22, 2026 07:33 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, successfully completed its 1st launch of 2026 and its 80th Electron launch overall. The mission ‘The Cosmos Will See You Now’ lifted off today from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, at 11:52 pm NZDT (10:52 UTC). The mission successfully deployed two satellites into a 1,050 km circular Earth orbit for Open Cosmos, a first-time dedicated launch customer. This higher-altitude deployment showcased Electron’s wide payload trajectory range, maintaining its reputation as a versatile and dependable small spacecraft launch vehicle that meets diverse mission requirements. Open Cosmos, a pan-European space technology company, offers complete end-to-end satellite services, encompassing everything from design and manufacturing to in-orbit operations and solutions. Just one week after securing high-priority Ka-band spectrum, it has launched the first satellites in its new proprietary low Earth orbit (LEO) telecom constellation. This new constellation compliments the already in orbit satellites that deliver high-resolution imagery and global monitoring capabilities, supporting a wide range of applications and providing valuable metadata for diverse uses. As Open Cosmos continues to increase satellite production each year to meet growing global demand, Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle is well-equipped to support its needs. Rocket Lab Founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: "What a great way to start off the year, by welcoming a new customer and launching a mission tailored just for them. Today’s launch is a great showcase of the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: accurate constellation deployment, streamlined access to space, and the reliability of consistently delivering mission success for our customers.” The upcoming year for Rocket Lab includes a busy manifest of Electron launches for new and repeat customers across its launch sites in Virginia and New Zealand, with Rocket Lab’s next Electron launch scheduled to take place shortly from Launch Complex 1.

January 21, 2026 19:00 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced an update relating to the development of its Neutron rocket. As the Company pushes Neutron to the limits and beyond to qualify its systems and structures for launch, qualification testing of the Stage 1 tank overnight resulted in a rupture during a hydrostatic pressure trial. Testing failures are not uncommon during qualification testing. We intentionally test structures to their limits to validate structural integrity and safety margins to ensure the robust requirements for a successful launch can be comfortably met. There was no significant damage to the test structure or facilities, the next Stage 1 tank is already in production, and Neutron’s development campaign continues while the team assesses today’s test outcome.The team is reviewing the Stage 1 test data, which will determine the extent of the impact to Neutron’s launch schedule. The Company intends to provide an update on the Neutron schedule during its 2025 Q4 earnings call in February.
