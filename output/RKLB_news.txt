We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints. We can deliver MSR mission success too.” Overall RKLB ranks 6th on our list of Monday's top losers. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RKLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The MACH-TB program, overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&E)) Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), is a cornerstone of the National Hypersonic Initiative 2.0. Its mission is to establish an affordable test bed that bridges the gap between ground-based hypersonic testing and full-scale flight tests. MACH-TB 2.0 aims to expand the nation's hypersonic flight testing capacity with a cost-effective and scalable approach. Under Task Area 1, Kratos holds the prime role in Systems Engineering, Integration, and Testing (SEIT). The company will manage subscale and full-scale systems and provide air launch services to address the growing demand for frequent hypersonic flight tests. Rocket Lab will support the Kratos-led team by offering systems engineering, assembly, integration, and testing (AI&T), as well as mission planning and launch services. Rocket Lab's involvement builds on its proven track record with the MACH-TB program. The company has conducted multiple successful hypersonic test launches using its HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) rocket. These launches took place at Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 2 in Wallops, Virginia. HASTE, a suborbital variant of the Electron launch vehicle, incorporates advanced technology such as carbon fiber composite structures and 3D-printed engines. It also features a modified Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic testing and offers a larger payload capacity of up to 700 kg (1,540 lbs). Rocket Lab's Vice President of Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, stated: "We're thrilled to be part of the Kratos-led team for the next iteration of the MACH-TB program and ready to serve the U.S. Department of Defense with even more high-cadence hypersonic technology with our HASTE launch vehicle. Our demonstrated ability to date to deliver successful HASTE launches that test these new technologies is testament to our dedication in advancing hypersonic innovation for the nation alongside our government and industry partners." To date, Rocket Lab's Electron and HASTE vehicles have successfully deployed over 200 payloads from launch sites in the United States and New Zealand, highlighting the company's expertise and reliability in both orbital and suborbital missions.
