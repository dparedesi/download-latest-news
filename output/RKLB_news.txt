The mission, titled 'The Harvest Goddess Thrives,' lifted off from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 04:10 UTC on August 5. A single SAR imaging satellite, QPS-SAR-12 - nicknamed KUSHINADA-I after the Japanese harvest goddess - was deployed into a 575 km circular orbit. This was Rocket Lab's fourth iQPS mission this year and the fifth overall, reinforcing Electron's position as the primary vehicle for building out the constellation. "Every Electron launch is a demonstration of payload deployment precision for our customers - an especially critical element when scaling satellite constellations," said Rocket Lab CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Today's fifth and flawless deployment for iQPS once again underscores Electron's reliability and continues to prove that consistent tailored access to space is a reality on Electron for our customers." iQPS CEO Dr. Shunsuke Onishi added: "Building a satellite constellation requires both timely development and manufacturing, as well as highly precise launch execution. We are deeply grateful to both our team and the Rocket Lab team for their continued dedication in making this possible. As the number of satellites increases, so too does the frequency and value of the data we are able to provide. We will continue to accelerate our efforts to ensure that our satellite data can be leveraged in even more fields and applications." This mission was Rocket Lab's 11th Electron launch of the year, with four additional iQPS launches planned through the rest of 2025 and into 2026. Details of the next Electron mission are expected soon.
