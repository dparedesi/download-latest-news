December 16, 2025 18:00 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced its next Electron launch will deploy the STP-S30 mission for the U.S. Space Force’s (USSF) Space Systems Command (SSC) after accelerating the launch of the mission by several months, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s agility in meeting the Department of War’s (DoW) space access demands. The launch, named ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’, is scheduled to liftoff from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia during a launch window that opens on December 18 at 05:00 UTC/12:00 a.m. Eastern (9:00 p.m. Pacific on December 17). Led by the DoW’s Space Test Program (STP) and the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), the STP-S30 mission will deploy the first four DiskSats to space: disk-shaped spacecraft platforms developed by The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace), managed by the SSC’s System Delta 89 (SYD 89) Capability Development Branch and funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Small Spacecraft & Distributed Systems program, based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley within the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, that offer an alternative approach to small satellites. Electron will deliver these DiskSats to a 550km low Earth orbit where Aerospace will test their maneuverability, launch dispenser mechanism, and orbit-changing capabilities using electric propulsion - key features for flexible, responsive space operations. Working with RSLP, Rocket Lab was able to accelerate the ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ launch to tomorrow from its initial target of April 2026, in what will be a demonstration of Rocket Lab’s industry-leading responsive launch service. The launch is also scheduled to take place less than a month after Rocket Lab’s most recent LC-2 launch, which was the first of two missions Rocket Lab recently deployed within 48 hours from two different hemispheres. ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ will be Electron’s 20th launch of the year and 78th mission overall. ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ launch information: https://rocketlabcorp.com/missions/next-mission ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ launch window opens: Rocket Lab Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

December 13, 2025 23:19 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its first dedicated mission for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – a pivotal marker of Electron’s global importance for regular, reliable, and dedicated access to space. The “RAISE And Shine” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 14, 2025 at 03:09 UTC / 16:09 NZDT to successfully deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft: a demonstration of eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The mission was the first of two dedicated missions for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. Rocket Lab’s successful launch for JAXA reflects the growing integration of commercial companies into national space programs both domestically and internationally. As the established small launch leader in the United States, Electron is also the preferred choice for reliable small launch globally, with its second upcoming mission for JAXA scheduled for launch in Q1 2026. A dedicated Electron launch for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also planned for launch in the new year, further highlighting Electron’s international demand. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This dedicated mission delivered precision and reliability for one of the world’s most respected space agencies, and we couldn’t be prouder of supporting JAXA with the dedicated access to space needed to support the growth of Japan’s aerospace economy. We’re proud to continue delivering the responsiveness and performance that Japan’s satellite operators have come to rely on.” “RAISE And Shine” was Rocket Lab’s 19th launch of the year: an extension of the Company’s new Electron annual launch record established just last month with two back-to-back missions launched in 48 hours. Rocket Lab’s next launch of 2025 is scheduled to take place from Launch Complex 2 this month and will be announced in the coming days. “RAISE And Shine” launch images: Flight 77 | RAISE & Shine | Flickr “RAISE And Shine” launch webcast: Rocket Lab - 'RAISE and Shine' Launch for JAXA - YouTube Rocket Lab Media Contact Murielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
