Share this The 90-tonne Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machine has been custom-designed and built for Rocket Lab and is expected to save around 150,000 manufacturing hours in the Neutron rocket’s production process. Long Beach, California. August 8, 2024. – Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has begun installation of the largest automated fiber placement (AFP) machine of its kind into the Company’s Neutron rocket production line in Middle River, MD. The AFP machine will enable Rocket Lab to automate production of the largest carbon composite rocket structures in history. The custom-built 99 ton (90 tonne), 39 ft tall (12-meter) robotic machine, American-made by Electroimpact in Washington, has just completed final acceptance testing with the manufacturer and installation has begun at Rocket Lab’s Space Structures Complex in Middle River, Maryland. The new machine will automate the production of all large composite structures of the Neutron launch vehicle including the panels that make up the 91 ft (28 meter) length interstage and fairing, 22.9 ft (7 meter) diameter first stage, and the 16.4 ft (5 meter) diameter second stage tank. The autonomous machine can move up to 98 ft (30 meters) in length and lay down continuous carbon fiber composite at a rate of 328 ft (100 meters) per minute. The AFP machine also has a fully automated real-time inspection system that hunts for miniscule defects throughout the laminated carbon composite and alerts the machine operator of any issues before the machine begins laying down the next layer, providing additional assurance that these critical structures of the launch vehicle meet Rocket Lab’s high-quality standards required for reusable Neutron launches. As Neutron’s carbon composite structures move into full-scale production, this autonomous machine is expected to introduce significant time-savings of 150,000+ manufacturing hours into the production process. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “As we build the world’s largest carbon composite rocket, it makes sense that we require a world-first carbon composite fiber placement machine. We’re combining our proprietary flight-proven carbon composite technology, additive manufacturing, and autonomous robotics to design and build large-scale aerospace components at a pace that will support not only Neutron’s launch cadence, but support Electron and carbon composites structures for our spacecraft customers too. We worked closely with our excellent partners at Electroimpact to create this robot and we’re thrilled with the results. It’s an innovative machine producing a next-generation rocket from one of the birthplaces of the aerospace industry in Baltimore, and we can’t wait to see its first carbon composite printed panels come off the production line soon.” The AFP machine will also be leveraged to print smaller carbon composite Neutron structures, first stages of Rocket Lab’s Electron launch vehicle, and other flight-proven carbon composite structures for space including spacecraft structural panels and assemblies, solar panel substrates, carbon composite tanks and primary structures, and custom projects for the aerospace industry. ENDS About Neutron Neutron is the new medium-lift reusable launch vehicle by Rocket Lab. Capable of carrying up to 13,000 kg to low Earth orbit, Neutron is designed to deliver constellations of satellites to space at once, important national security missions, and human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. Neutron will be the world’s first medium-lift carbon composite rocket, building off of Rocket Lab’s proprietary and flight-proven techniques utilized across 50+ launches of its Electron carbon composite small orbital launch vehicle. Powering Neutron is Rocket Lab’s new 3D printed reusable rocket engine Archimedes, an oxygen-rich staged combustion engine using liquid oxygen and methane propellants that is designed for rapid reusability, deep throttle ability for multiple engine burns in space, and for propulsive landings when returning to the launch site. Neutron will launch and land at its own dedicated launch and test range within Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, Virginia, starting in 2025.

TOP TECH PICKS: Nvidia And Other Chip Stocks Rise On Analyst Comments The stock market rally sits on a six-week win streak, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 ending last week at fresh highs. Market leadership is broad, both in terms of sectors and temperament. Amid that strength, investors are crowding into stocks with subpar fundamentals, driving many of the more speculative names sharply higher this month. The market is in what IBD refers to as a power trend: a set of technical factors combined into conditions that are most ideal for trend traders. This opens the door for investors to invest in some more speculative names, but only with a limited portion of their portfolio. Even then, investors must understand that such stocks come with greater risks. They tend to be highly volatile and at risk of making huge moves — either up or down. A power trend usually ends with a major index's 21-day exponential moving average crossing back below its 50-moving average, according to IBD trading principles. Nuclear energy technology development companies, along with bitcoin stocks and a few space plays have skyrocketed in the stock market this month. Other more speculative plays that have surged are Trump Media & Technology (DJT), Carvana (CVNA) and Upstart (UPST). The Donald Trump-backed DJT had skyrocketed 114% in October, advancing 17% last week. Carvana stock had jumped 13% in October and gained more than 50% since hitting a recent low of 124.39 on Sept. 10. Meanwhile, Upstart, the AI cloud-based lending platform, had rallied 30% this month. Similar to Carvana, Upstart hit a recent low of 31.92 on Sept. 1o and has gained 62% since then. It should be noted that many of the speculative stocks surging in October appear on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets site. Website ApeWisdom shows Carvana, DJT, Oklo (OKLO), NuScale Power (SMR), AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) were among the trending stocks on r/WallStreetBets through the weekend. Heading into Wednesday's market open, Oklo — the nuclear power startup backed by OpenAI head Sam Altman — has surged more than 157% in October as major hyperscalers have decided to double down on the nuclear renaissance driven by data centers and artificial intelligence. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) both recently inked nuclear deals, sending nuclear-related stocks higher. Oklo stock sank 4.3% during premarket trade on Wednesday after dropping 6.7% to 20.82 on Tuesday. The stock jumped 22.4% in Monday's action. Shares ended last week up 99%, including a 40.5% surge on Wednesday. The stock cleared an early entry last Tuesday. The Altman-backed developer small modular reactors, or SMRs, has soared around 230% since Microsoft (MSFT) and Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a two-decade deal on Sept. 20. This Sam Altman Startup Has Exploded 125% This Month As Nuclear Stocks Heat Up Cathie Wood and her ARK Invest sold 378,589 shares of Oklo on Monday for $8.45 million, based on the stock's closing price. Prior to Monday, ARK Invest built a position of more than 1 million shares of Oklo since mid-July. Peter Thiel is also a major investor in Oklo. Fellow SMR-focused company Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE) declined 14% Tuesday. NNE advanced 34.2% Monday, adding to an 8.8% gain from Friday. The shares leapt 37.8% last Wednesday. Meanwhile, NuScale Power also dropped 6% Tuesday. The stock advanced 4.2% to 18.98 Monday. SMR shares also soared 40% last Wednesday. SMR shares have jumped 54% in October. Space-based telecommunications provider AST SpaceMobile rebounded above a key moving average on Oct. 16. ASTS stock has gained 6.6% this month but has rocketed more than 360% higher on the year on the strength of a 274% advance in May. Meanwhile, Long Beach, Calif.-based Rocket Lab USA provides aerospace launching services and produces components for small to medium-sized spacecraft and satellites, with the goal of making space launches more accessible and affordable. The company on Oct. 7 announced it was selected by NASA to complete a study for retrieving rock samples from Mars and returning them to Earth. Rocket Lab is working on a mission concept, which it says will be delivered at a "fraction" of the current projected program cost and conclude several years earlier than the current expected return date in 2040. SpaceX Rival Rockets Past Buy Point, But Beware Of Reentry Rocket Lab stock is up more than 14% during stock market action in October, after surging 55% in September. RKLB is up about 100% in 2024. Among publicly traded bitcoin miners, Bit Digital (BTBT), Hive Digital (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) have advanced between 13% and 28% in October. Bitcoin Miners Forge Lucrative AI Deals.
