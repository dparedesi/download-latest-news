Get ready for a four-day trading week—if you trade bonds. With several key economic reports expected to be delayed by the government shutdown, investors will this week focus largely on corporate earnings reports. And some will get a short break: Bond markets, banks and government offices will close Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, though stock markets will remain open. Earnings from Walt Disney, CoreWeave, Sony, Cisco, and Applied Materials highlight this week’s corporate calendar. The small business optimism survey for October comes as market watchers are paying attention to how economic pressures are impacting small firms. The monthly federal budget report from the Treasury Department is expected to show how much revenue is coming from tariffs. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Earnings from artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave on Monday will likely keep investors' focus on the technology that has helped drive markets higher over the past few years. After going public earlier this year, CoreWeave shares have more than doubled. Deals with chipmaker Nvidia and social media giant Meta are driving optimism in the firm's business. Nuclear power provider Oklo's report on Tuesday is expected to show growth tied to the electricity needs for AI data centers. Network infrastructure provider Cisco's report on Wednesday comes after it nearly doubled its AI sales target in the prior quarter. On Thursday, Applied Materials is due to report as the chipmaking equipment supplier faces restrictions on its sales to China. Walt Disney’s report on Thursday follows the company’s recent launch of its ESPN sports app and plans to purchase the NFL network. Other noteworthy earnings this week include stablecoin provider Circle Internet Group, FanDuel-parent Flutter Entertainment, satellite launch firm Rocket Lab, and sneaker maker On Holdings. But there's more on tap than earnings, and that includes Tuesday, when chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is set to hold an analyst day at which CEO Lisa Su is expected to offer more details on the company’s artificial intelligence roadmap.
