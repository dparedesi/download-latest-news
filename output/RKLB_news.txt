The mission will take place at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, where an Electron rocket will deploy eight satellites into a 550 km orbit. This rapid-response mission is scheduled for deployment within just four months of the contract signing, aligning with the time-sensitive requirements of OroraTech's wildfire monitoring objectives. The short turnaround time underscores Rocket Lab's capacity for responsive launches tailored to urgent satellite deployment needs. OroraTech's satellite constellation features thermal infrared cameras capable of providing continuous, global wildfire monitoring. The upcoming mission will add OTC-P1 satellites to their current network, enhancing the ability to support first responders, government agencies, and industry partners in protecting forests, communities, and infrastructure. OroraTech plans to expand its network to a total of 100 satellites by 2028. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, highlighted the advantages of launching on the Electron rocket: "This launch is a showcase of all the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: control over schedule, agility and ability to meet tight deadlines and mission requirements, and the reliability of launching on the world's most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Knowing that time is of the essence to get these satellites in space, we're proud to be rising to the challenge and supporting the OroraTech mission to better monitor for and protect against these devastating natural disasters globally." This mission is part of Rocket Lab's busy 2025 schedule, which includes multi-launch contracts with Synspective, Kineis, and BlackSky. Additional plans involve a responsive space mission for the U.S. Space Force that will deliver a spacecraft on just 24 hours' notice, as well as the inaugural launch of Rocket Lab's medium-lift reusable rocket, Neutron.

"Gen-3 represents a transformative leap forward for space-based intelligence, combining very high-resolution imagery with high frequency monitoring," said Brian O'Toole, BlackSky CEO. "When combined with BlackSky Spectra, the Gen-3 constellation is designed to deliver data at sub-hourly, mission-relevant speeds. We look forward to the inaugural launch and introducing the advanced features of our Gen-3 satellites to our customers." The Gen-3 satellite program is specifically tailored to meet rising demand from global defense and intelligence sectors. "BlackSky has developed Gen-3 to address significant demand from key defense and intelligence customers around the world as evidenced by the significant contracted backlog we have secured for Gen-3 services," added O'Toole. "Once we commission this first satellite, we expect to move forward with a regular cadence of additional launches throughout the year as more Gen-3 satellites come off the production line." The ongoing evolution of BlackSky's constellation will provide enhanced capacity and operational flexibility. The Gen-3 satellites are equipped to perform automated detection, identification, and classification of a broad range of tactical assets, such as vehicles, aircraft, vessels, and other objects of interest. Low-latency intersatellite communication capabilities will allow users to prioritize last-minute tasking and enable high-priority operations. In addition, agile onboard attitude control systems will maximize efficiency during missions. These advancements are set to strengthen BlackSky's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for both tactical and strategic operations, reinforcing its role as a leading provider of space-based intelligence solutions.
