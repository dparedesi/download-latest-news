December 13, 2025 23:19 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its first dedicated mission for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – a pivotal marker of Electron’s global importance for regular, reliable, and dedicated access to space. The “RAISE And Shine” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 14, 2025 at 03:09 UTC / 16:09 NZDT to successfully deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft: a demonstration of eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The mission was the first of two dedicated missions for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. Rocket Lab’s successful launch for JAXA reflects the growing integration of commercial companies into national space programs both domestically and internationally. As the established small launch leader in the United States, Electron is also the preferred choice for reliable small launch globally, with its second upcoming mission for JAXA scheduled for launch in Q1 2026. A dedicated Electron launch for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also planned for launch in the new year, further highlighting Electron’s international demand. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This dedicated mission delivered precision and reliability for one of the world’s most respected space agencies, and we couldn’t be prouder of supporting JAXA with the dedicated access to space needed to support the growth of Japan’s aerospace economy. We’re proud to continue delivering the responsiveness and performance that Japan’s satellite operators have come to rely on.” “RAISE And Shine” was Rocket Lab’s 19th launch of the year: an extension of the Company’s new Electron annual launch record established just last month with two back-to-back missions launched in 48 hours. Rocket Lab’s next launch of 2025 is scheduled to take place from Launch Complex 2 this month and will be announced in the coming days. “RAISE And Shine” launch images: Flight 77 | RAISE & Shine | Flickr “RAISE And Shine” launch webcast: Rocket Lab - 'RAISE and Shine' Launch for JAXA - YouTube Rocket Lab Media Contact Murielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
