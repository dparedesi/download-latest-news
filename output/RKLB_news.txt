Investing After rocketing nearly $10 higher on Monday, shares of Micron Technology are up another $2.10 this morning. Sending You to Google News in 3 © RomanR / Shutterstock.com With gold rebounding about $55 this morning, mining stocks, like Newmont Corp. (NYSE: NEM), are up about $1.85. All after the overbought stock lost nearly $6 of value yesterday, with gold’s 4.5% pullback. Shares of SSR Mining (NASDAQ: SSRM) are up about 50 cents on the rebound. Even shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) are up about 80 cents on the news. Despite yesterday’s pullback in gold, we have to remember that growing geopolitical tension, economic uncertainty, expectations of further interest rate cuts, a weak dollar, and strong interest from central banks could send gold prices screaming even higher. In fact, as we noted just yesterday, Bank of America is targeting $5,000 by 2026. JPMorgan is targeting $5,055. HSBC analysts are targeting $5,000 by early 2026, too. Shares of Rocket Lab Corp. (NASDAQ: RKLB) are up about $2 a share in premarket. While the stock took a breather after a substantial run from $40.88 to nearly $80 a share, it’s seeing further upside. Helping, analysts at Needham recently raised their price target on RKLH to $90 from $63, with a buy rating. All after the U.S. Space Development Agency awarded RKLB a prime contract to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, as noted in a press release. “Under the $816 million contract, Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.

December 29, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – The counter-unmanned aircraft system market is projected to reach $20.31 billion by 2030, growing from $6.64 billion in 2025 at a 25.1% compound annual growth rate, driven by accelerating threats from hostile drones across military and critical infrastructure domains[1]. The Space Development Agency awarded $3.5 billion in contracts this month for 72 missile tracking satellites designed to detect hypersonic threats from low Earth orbit, signaling the Pentagon's pivot toward integrated deterrence architectures that prioritize space-based sensing and autonomous response systems[2]. This convergence of orbital surveillance and tactical edge protection drives the investment thesis for VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV), and BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI). The military unmanned systems market is projected to reach $76.05 billion by 2035 from $28.02 billion in 2025, reflecting a 10.5% annual growth rate fueled by Department of Defense mandates for multi-domain autonomous platforms[3]. The AI in defense sector is expected to surge from $12.55 billion in 2024 to $178.14 billion by 2034 at a 30.38% compound annual growth rate[4], as battlefield commanders demand machine-speed decision frameworks capable of countering hypersonic missiles, drone swarms, and contested space environments. VisionWave Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: VWAV) recently completed the acquisition of Solar Drone Ltd., an autonomous robotics company and subsidiary of BladeRanger, marking the defense technology developer's first acquisition since its July 2025 public listing. The transaction closed through a Share Purchase Agreement involving 1,800,000 shares of common stock, positioning VisionWave to address defense applications alongside the solar operations and maintenance robotics market. “The completion of the Solar Drone acquisition marks an important inflection point for VisionWave,” said Douglas Davis, Executive Chairman of VisionWave. “This is not a standalone asset, but a platform capability that strengthens our autonomous robotics roadmap across defense, security, and critical infrastructure. We believe Solar Drone may accelerate our ability to deploy intelligent, mission-ready systems at scale.” The acquisition provides VisionWave with access to autonomous systems designed for critical infrastructure monitoring across more than 165 GW of installed U.S. utility-scale solar capacity and over 260 GW in Europe. Solar Drone completed a 100-day Proof of Concept with DB InfraGO AG through DB mindbox, with DB InfraGO AG recommending advancement to discussions with Sky Operations, DB Services, and DB Energie departments. The company's autonomous robotics capabilities complement VisionWave's development of Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms and counter-drone systems designed for defense and security applications. The integration of Solar Drone's technologies supports VisionWave's strategy to deliver autonomous solutions across multiple operational domains. VisionWave initiated the patent application process for a planned series of patents covering key technologies underlying Argus, the company's space-enabled, AI-driven counter-unmanned aircraft system developed in collaboration with BladeRanger. The intellectual property strategy targets Argus's core architecture including the SkyWeave high-frequency communications backbone, space and ground-based drone detection methods, and end-to-end decision frameworks for detection, classification, tracking, and engagement. Additional filings are expected to address HF-enabled sensor fusion, multi-layer control logic, and secure encryption mechanisms optimized for contested environments. VisionWave announced a non-binding letter of intent with Evie Autonomous Limited to explore a £500,000 Proof-of-Concept program integrating autonomous vehicle technology into VisionWave's Unmanned Ground Vehicle platforms. The POC program targets advanced navigation and multi-sensor fusion capabilities for the Varan UGV platform unveiled in November 2025, with discussions anticipated to continue into 2026 pending definitive agreements. The partnership discussions align with VisionWave's expansion of its London-based UGV research and development engineering team. VisionWave's acquisition strategy and technology development initiatives position the company to address defense, security, and commercial markets through a multi-domain autonomy approach spanning counter-UAS systems, autonomous ground vehicles, and industrial robotics applications.
