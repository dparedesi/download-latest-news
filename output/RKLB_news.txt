(iQPS), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 21 at 7:36 p.m. (06:36 UTC) to deploy the QPS-SAR-15 to space for iQPS. The spacecraft will join the company’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation providing near-real time imagery across twelve different orbits for iQPS’ global customers. Rocket Lab first launched for iQPS in 2023 and has gone on to deploy seven satellites to the iQPS constellation, making Electron the primary launcher for iQPS. A further five launches on Electron for iQPS are planned from 2026. Today’s mission has set a new annual launch record for Electron: 21 launches in one year with 100% mission success. The record cements Electron as both America’s preeminent small launch provider and the world’s most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Congratulations to iQPS on this latest successful mission for their constellation, and to the Rocket Lab team on a fantastic record-setting year of Electron launches. Electron makes frequent and reliable launch look easy as it outpaces all other American small-lift orbital rockets, year after year. In 2026, we’re expanding Electron’s global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security. Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions go to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry, and we’re looking forward to another year of continued execution in 2026.” ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission was Rocket Lab’s 79th overall Electron mission and final scheduled launch for 2025. The next Electron launch is slated to take place in early Q1 2026. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch images: F79 | The Wisdom God Guides ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch broadcast: Rocket Lab - ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ Launch Rocket Lab Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

December 19, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced it has been awarded a landmark prime contract by the U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 (TRKT3) program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The award is Rocket Lab’s largest single contract to date and underscores its growing reputation as a trusted prime in national security space. Under the $816 million contract, Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems. The award includes a $806 million base contract plus up to $10.45 million in options. Each satellite will feature Rocket Lab’s next-generation Phoenix infrared sensor payload, a wide field-of-view (WFOV) solution designed to meet the evolving missile defense needs of national security space. To ensure mission resilience, the satellites will be equipped with Rocket Lab’s advanced StarLite space protection sensors, designed to safeguard the constellation against directed energy threats. Notably, StarLite sensors have also been adopted by other prime contractors developing TRKT3 satellites, further expanding Rocket Lab’s role in the program and unlocking additional contract value beyond its own satellite production. In addition to the $816M prime contract award value, as a leading merchant supplier into the other TRKT3 prime contractors, there are additional subsystem opportunities that could take the total capture value to approximately $1 billion for supplying items such as payloads, solar solutions, attitude determination and control components, software, and other solutions from our broad portfolio of capabilities. Disrupting Traditional Defense Primes with Vertical IntegrationRocket Lab’s satellites will be built on its proven Lightning platform, leveraging the Company’s vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities to deliver an unmatched combination of speed, cost efficiency, and quality. All major components – from solar arrays, reaction wheels and star trackers to propulsion systems, avionics, payloads, and launch dispensers – are designed and produced in-house. This end-to-end approach enables Rocket Lab to rapidly scale production while maintaining control over cost and schedule, a critical advantage in meeting the urgent demands of national security missions. “The Tranche 3 Tracking Layer constellation is part of the U.S. Space Force’s strategy to counter rapidly evolving global threats, ensuring the nation’s defense capabilities remain ahead of adversaries. Rocket Lab is honored to play a role in enabling this,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “Demand for resilient, scalable, and affordable space systems continues to grow, and this award demonstrates that Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in delivering solutions that meet the needs of national security. As the only commercial provider producing both spacecraft and payloads in-house for the SDA Tracking Layer, Rocket Lab is delivering a truly disruptive solution that combines speed, resilience, and affordability. This contract underscores that Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated approach isn’t just a competitive advantage – we’re enabling a fundamental shift in how national security space programs are executed.” Building on Momentum: $1.3 Billion in SDA Contracts AwardedThis contract builds on Rocket Lab’s existing $515 million award to deliver 18 satellites for SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program, which provides secure, low-latency communications across the PWSA. The more than $1.3 billion in contract value now awarded to Rocket Lab by SDA demonstrates strong confidence in Rocket Lab’s ability to execute on large-scale, high-stakes national security programs. Rocket Lab’s growing role as a prime contractor for the U.S. Space Force highlights its emergence as a formidable competitor to legacy aerospace primes. By combining technology, vertical integration, and a proven track record of delivering results, Rocket Lab is redefining what’s possible in national security space. + Rocket Lab Media Contactmedia@rocketlabusa.com + About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads, and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
