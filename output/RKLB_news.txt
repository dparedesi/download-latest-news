We recently published a list of 10 Unstoppable Growth Stocks To Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against other unstoppable growth stocks to buy according to Reddit. Tech stocks in the US saw a decline amid DeepSeek AI concerns shortly after the market rose post Trump’s $500 billion AI investment announcement in project Stargate. The OpenAI rival is said to follow an open-source model and celebrates similar efficiency at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI. The launch of the Chinese startup has shaken the stock market in the US and to discuss the aftermath of such Sarah Kreps, Director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance on January 27, 2025. Kreps suggested that this small startup is seen to perform in the same way these “pioneers” in the United States do. She added that the launch puts “enormous pressure” on firms in the United States and expects companies in the US to put more effort into delivering customer value to their AI investments moving forward, suggesting that competition can be “good” for these companies. Similarly, on January 27, Matt Calkins, Founder and CEO of Appian (APPN), appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the implications of DeepSeek on the US market. Calkins suggested that the AI war between the two countries is going to be an asymmetric war for US and China, and any other countries planning to get involved. He also added that the things “that make China strong” differ from the elements that make the USA strong, therefore, companies in either country do not need to strive to match each other. Calkins also believes that the DeepSeek announcement is a “wake-up call” for companies in the United States and expects more surprises to come from the rapidly changing industry. He strongly emphasized the need for a framework on a state level that protects the rights and privacy of Americans for this situation to work out and position the US for success. However, he reiterated the need to first understand the dynamics of the AI industry, the value of these AI models, and the source of data before comprehensive frameworks are established. Overall, the AI, and technology market as a whole, is extremely disruptive and subject to rapid changes, making such surprises a part of the bigger picture.

The mission will take place at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, where an Electron rocket will deploy eight satellites into a 550 km orbit. This rapid-response mission is scheduled for deployment within just four months of the contract signing, aligning with the time-sensitive requirements of OroraTech's wildfire monitoring objectives. The short turnaround time underscores Rocket Lab's capacity for responsive launches tailored to urgent satellite deployment needs. OroraTech's satellite constellation features thermal infrared cameras capable of providing continuous, global wildfire monitoring. The upcoming mission will add OTC-P1 satellites to their current network, enhancing the ability to support first responders, government agencies, and industry partners in protecting forests, communities, and infrastructure. OroraTech plans to expand its network to a total of 100 satellites by 2028. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, highlighted the advantages of launching on the Electron rocket: "This launch is a showcase of all the benefits of flying dedicated on Electron: control over schedule, agility and ability to meet tight deadlines and mission requirements, and the reliability of launching on the world's most frequently launched small orbital rocket. Knowing that time is of the essence to get these satellites in space, we're proud to be rising to the challenge and supporting the OroraTech mission to better monitor for and protect against these devastating natural disasters globally." This mission is part of Rocket Lab's busy 2025 schedule, which includes multi-launch contracts with Synspective, Kineis, and BlackSky. Additional plans involve a responsive space mission for the U.S. Space Force that will deliver a spacecraft on just 24 hours' notice, as well as the inaugural launch of Rocket Lab's medium-lift reusable rocket, Neutron.
