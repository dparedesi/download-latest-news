Title: RKLB Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) has shown exceptional growth in 2025, with its stock climbing nearly 90% year-to-date. This surge has been driven by the company’s recent successful rocket launches and its ability to secure major new contracts, particularly related to its upcoming Neutron rocket program. But what could drive another sharp rally from current levels to targets above $85? The following analysis explores the main factors that could fuel such significant upside over the next three years. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – UNH Stock To $600? Rocket Lab’s revenue outlook points to substantial expansion. With last-twelve-month revenues of $504 million, the company could more than double its revenue base to around $1.2 billion by 2027. This growth is supported by several drivers: Rocket Lab’s valuation multiple highlights its trajectory. Trading at nearly 50 times trailing revenues, RKLB reflects the premium placed on high-growth space companies. Yet, multiple compression suggests strong upside: If revenues double in three years while the stock price holds steady, the revenue multiple would fall to 25x. Given the company’s growth and positioning, a more realistic scenario is a multiple near 35x by 2027. At that multiple applied to expected 2027 revenues above $1.2 billion, the implied share price is about $85—nearly 80% higher than today. This reflects Rocket Lab’s growth story and the valuation premium typically afforded to leading space firms. Several catalysts could accelerate Rocket Lab’s trajectory: Potential challenges could slow this trajectory: This analysis outlines an upside case for Rocket Lab based on its growth and positioning. While a move to $85+ offers attractive potential, investors must weigh these gains against real risks. The 2022 correction, when RKLB lost 83% of its value, underscored the volatility inherent in space investments. This bullish case depends on successful execution in Neutron development, contract wins, and global expansion. Investors should size positions carefully, recognizing both the large upside and the risks tied to this high-growth sector. As always, investing in just one or a few stocks carries risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a diversified collection of 30 stocks that has consistently beaten the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? Because HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with less risk, offering smoother performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. This reinforces the value of diversification, particularly when considering high-growth but volatile names like RKLB.
