[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Time Published: 2025-03-19T13:19:16Z
Full Content:
The mission, titled "Finding Hot Wildfires Near You," is slated for liftoff during a window beginning March 27th UTC from Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. Remarkably, this launch was arranged just four months following the signing of the contract, underscoring Rocket Lab's capability to meet tight deadlines for time-sensitive satellite missions. Electron will carry eight satellites from OroraTech's Constellation Phase 1 to a 550km orbit. These spacecraft are part of OroraTech's broader initiative to deliver near-real-time thermal imaging data, enhancing wildfire detection efforts on a global scale. The satellites' thermal infrared cameras, coupled with AI-powered analytics, are designed to support rapid decision-making for first responders, government agencies, and other stakeholders in managing wildfires and related hazards. This capability is expected to bolster the protection of communities, ecosystems, and vital infrastructure. This launch will mark Rocket Lab's fifth mission of 2025 and its 63rd Electron launch overall. Upon completion, Electron will have successfully deployed 224 satellites into orbit, further demonstrating its reliability and consistency in the small satellite launch market.

Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: Rocket Lab boosts Varda's space manufacturing with third successful orbital mission

This deployment follows closely on the heels of Varda's W-2 mission, which concluded with a successful reentry and landing just 15 days prior. Like its predecessor, the W-3 mission is powered by Rocket Lab's advanced Pioneer spacecraft platform. Pioneer provides critical support to Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule in orbit, supplying power, communication links, propulsion, and attitude control throughout the mission. The capsule enables Varda to conduct pharmaceutical production in microgravity, a unique environment that cannot be replicated on Earth and is particularly advantageous for certain drug development processes. The Pioneer spacecraft incorporates Rocket Lab's comprehensive suite of in-house designed components and subsystems. These include propulsion units, flight control software, avionics, star trackers, reaction wheels, separation mechanisms, solar arrays, communication systems, composite structures, and propellant tanks. Upon completion of the manufacturing operations in orbit, Rocket Lab manages the deorbit process, executing maneuvers to guide the capsule back toward Earth. The mission plan concludes with reentry and landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, which is managed by Southern Launch. This marks Rocket Lab's third successful mission for Varda; the inaugural W-1 mission ended with a landing in Utah in February 2024, while W-2 concluded with a touchdown in South Australia on February 27, 2025. "The W-1 mission was the first in-space manufacturing mission to happen outside of the International Space Station. Now, just over a year later, we have a third mission on orbit after bringing another one safely back home. We're immensely proud to have supported our mission partner Varda to usher in a new era of rapid, reliable, and innovative commercial in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry capability," said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab Founder and CEO. "It's remarkable that we have been able to launch our third mission in such rapid succession after the reentry of our second. High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

The mission, named "The Lightning God Reigns," lifted off from Launch Complex 1 at Mahia, New Zealand, on March 15, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. NZDT (00:00 UTC). The Electron rocket delivered iQPS' QPS-SAR-9 satellite into a circular orbit 575 kilometers above Earth. This launch follows a December 2023 mission in which Rocket Lab deployed another SAR satellite for iQPS, supporting the development of its radar imaging satellite network. This successful deployment is the first of eight planned launches for iQPS under one of Rocket Lab's largest launch contracts. The agreement includes five more missions in 2025 and two in 2026, all contributing to iQPS' vision of a 36-satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. The system is designed to deliver high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night Earth observation capabilities worldwide. Rocket Lab's next mission for iQPS is targeted for no earlier than May 2025. The company's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the significance of Electron's role in enabling constellation missions: "Congratulations to the Rocket Lab and iQPS teams on yet another successful mission together. Every Electron launch in 2025 so far has been to expand a satellite constellation and with this latest mission success, you can see why. Electron provides our customers with total flexibility and control over their schedule, orbit, and other critical mission elements to create their constellation exactly as they need it. We're looking forward to continuing our constellation build out for iQPS this year and next." Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, highlighted the collaboration's efficiency: "I sincerely appreciate the dedication and hard work of the teams at iQPS and Rocket Lab in making this launch mission a success, and I am truly impressed by the short timeline from QPS-SAR-9's departure from Fukuoka, Japan, through its journey via Mahia Peninsula, to its successful deployment into LEO. As we prepare for the launch of seven more QPS-SARs between this year and next year, I am reassured by the reliability and efficiency of Electron in executing missions like this one." Rocket Lab is set to launch its next mission from Launch Complex 1 in just three days, with liftoff scheduled for March 18, 2025 NZDT.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.
