Following a successful Preliminary Design Review in late 2024, the CDR signifies readiness for Rocket Lab to begin building the full constellation of 18 satellites. These satellites are part of the SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a resilient and low-latency communication network in low Earth orbit (LEO) designed to ensure real-time connectivity for U.S. and allied forces. "The Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture is reshaping how the U.S. secures space for the joint force, and Rocket Lab is proud to be a contributor," said Brad Clevenger, President of Rocket Lab National Security. "With proven platforms and in-house production across key systems, we're building the backbone of resilient on-orbit capability for the warfighter. Our successful completion of CDR further demonstrates our ability to deliver trusted technology at the speed and scale needed to support national security space." The spacecraft are built on Rocket Lab's Lightning platform, optimized for the power and data throughput required by national security missions in LEO. As a vertically integrated manufacturer, Rocket Lab produces major subsystems in-house, including solar panels, star trackers, radios, avionics, and launch dispensers. This approach ensures tight control over quality, cost, and delivery timelines.
