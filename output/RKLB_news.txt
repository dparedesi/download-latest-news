ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company’s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock’s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
