We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints. We can deliver MSR mission success too.” Overall RKLB ranks 6th on our list of Monday's top losers. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
