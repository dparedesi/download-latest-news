ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab’s stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) trended lower following the company's announcement to raise $750 million through equity dilution. This move, which increases the total number of shares, often concerns investors because it can negatively impact a company's earnings per share. The key question is the extent of the downside risk for RKLB stock. Despite its recent decline, the stock still appears overvalued. This overvaluation, combined with the stock’s history of only modest rebounds after previous drops, suggests there is considerable risk. Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals are solid – for RKLB, see Buy or Sell RKLB Stock – we are cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it is crucial to determine if the situation deteriorates significantly, leading to an additional drop of 20-30% to the $33 level, and whether we will be able to retain the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Below is an in-depth analysis of Rocket Lab’s downturn resilience – particularly, its performance in comparison to the market during previous crises. It turns out that the stock experienced an impact that was slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent to which the stock fell and (b) how swiftly it recovered. Below are the specifics, but before that, as a brief background: RKLB offers launch services, small orbital vehicles, and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government space and defense sectors. Overall, Rocket Lab (RKLB) stock has a history of experiencing significant declines during broader market corrections. While the company has generated investor interest through its successful rocket launches and new contracts—especially for its upcoming Neutron rocket—investors should also be mindful of the potential downside risk.
