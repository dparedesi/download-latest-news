Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

March 14, 2025 12:55 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 28, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ROCKET LAB INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 28, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Rocket Lab Plans to Acquire Mynaric to Strengthen Space Communications Portfolio
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Plans_to_Acquire_Mynaric_to_Strengthen_Space_Communications_Portfolio_999.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:48:42Z

By integrating Mynaric's optical communications expertise, Rocket Lab aims to reinforce its position as a vertically integrated space company. The transaction is expected to bolster Rocket Lab's launch and satellite manufacturing capabilities while expanding its component supply chain. Rocket Lab may finance this and other potential acquisitions through equity offerings. Enhancing Optical Communications for Satellite Constellations The demand for cost-effective and scalable laser communication solutions has outpaced supply, presenting a challenge for satellite constellation operators. Rocket Lab has previously demonstrated its ability to scale satellite components to meet industry demand, and it plans to apply the same approach to Mynaric's optical terminals, ensuring wider availability and affordability. With an estimated acquisition cost of $75 million-significantly lower than the more than $300 million invested in Mynaric to date-Rocket Lab would establish a European base in Munich, Germany, integrating a workforce of over 300 engineers and specialists. This expansion would enhance Rocket Lab's European market presence and growth opportunities across its product and service lines. The acquisition would grant Rocket Lab access to advanced production assets, intellectual property, product inventory, and existing customer commitments for satellite-to-satellite optical connectivity solutions. This aligns with Rocket Lab's strategy to deepen vertical integration for manufacturing and future high-value satellite missions. Strengthening SDA and Government Contracts Mynaric has already played a critical role as a subcontractor to Rocket Lab, supplying CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals for Rocket Lab's $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA). This contract involves building 18 satellites for the SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric also supplies technology for other SDA projects, serving a shared customer base that includes commercial constellation operators, defense contractors, and government agencies. By acquiring Mynaric, Rocket Lab intends to scale production efficiency and enhance manufacturing capabilities, ensuring customers receive reliable and timely delivery of optical terminals for SDA and other missions. A Strategic Step in Rocket Lab's Space Vision Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck commented, "We have been very clear about this strategic direction for several years now - Rocket Lab is pursuing every part of the space value chain. We launch our own rockets, we build satellites in constellation volumes, and now we're closing in on the final step and most valuable part of the space economy - operating our own constellations to provide data and services from space using our newly announced Flatellite spacecraft. Mynaric has paved the way in developing laser technology. Their team and technologies will make a compelling addition to our satellite component portfolio and we look forward to making the technology available at scale for our own constellations and those of our customers." The acquisition remains subject to the completion of Mynaric's StaRUG restructuring and subsequent execution of a definitive agreement. Rocket Lab's initial purchase price is expected to be $75 million, payable in cash or Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional earn-out provision of up to $75 million based on future revenue targets. The final purchase price may be adjusted based on further investment by lenders in Mynaric before the deal closes. The agreement includes an exclusive negotiation period between Rocket Lab and the lenders, customary due diligence, and regulatory approval requirements. Mynaric is not currently a party to the term sheet, and Rocket Lab will not acquire any of its outstanding equity interests unless the restructuring eliminates them as planned.

This expansion would enhance Rocket Lab's European market presence and growth opportunities across its product and service lines. The acquisition would grant Rocket Lab access to advanced production assets, intellectual property, product inventory, and existing customer commitments for satellite-to-satellite optical connectivity solutions. This aligns with Rocket Lab's strategy to deepen vertical integration for manufacturing and future high-value satellite missions. Strengthening SDA and Government Contracts Mynaric has already played a critical role as a subcontractor to Rocket Lab, supplying CONDOR Mk3 optical communication terminals for Rocket Lab's $515 million prime contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA). This contract involves building 18 satellites for the SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer-Beta. Mynaric also supplies technology for other SDA projects, serving a shared customer base that includes commercial constellation operators, defense contractors, and government agencies. By acquiring Mynaric, Rocket Lab intends to scale production efficiency and enhance manufacturing capabilities, ensuring customers receive reliable and timely delivery of optical terminals for SDA and other missions. A Strategic Step in Rocket Lab's Space Vision Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck commented, "We have been very clear about this strategic direction for several years now - Rocket Lab is pursuing every part of the space value chain. We launch our own rockets, we build satellites in constellation volumes, and now we're closing in on the final step and most valuable part of the space economy - operating our own constellations to provide data and services from space using our newly announced Flatellite spacecraft. Mynaric has paved the way in developing laser technology. Their team and technologies will make a compelling addition to our satellite component portfolio and we look forward to making the technology available at scale for our own constellations and those of our customers." The acquisition remains subject to the completion of Mynaric's StaRUG restructuring and subsequent execution of a definitive agreement. Rocket Lab's initial purchase price is expected to be $75 million, payable in cash or Rocket Lab common stock, with an additional earn-out provision of up to $75 million based on future revenue targets. The final purchase price may be adjusted based on further investment by lenders in Mynaric before the deal closes. The agreement includes an exclusive negotiation period between Rocket Lab and the lenders, customary due diligence, and regulatory approval requirements. Mynaric is not currently a party to the term sheet, and Rocket Lab will not acquire any of its outstanding equity interests unless the restructuring eliminates them as planned.

Title: Rocket Lab to twice in three Days, set to complete Kineis IoT constellation
URL: https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Rocket_Lab_Sets_Record_with_Two_Launches_in_Three_Days_Completes_Kineis_IoT_Constellation_999.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:48:42Z
Full Content:
The upcoming Electron mission for iQPS is planned for no earlier than March 15th NZDT. This will be swiftly followed by another Electron launch for Kineis, a global Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity provider, during a launch window opening on March 18th NZDT. The "High Five" mission represents the final launch in a five-mission contract with Kineis. Through this agreement, Rocket Lab has deployed a complete constellation of 25 IoT satellites in under a year. Previous launches took place in June, September, and November 2024, as well as February 2025. The "High Five" mission will mark Rocket Lab's 62nd Electron launch overall and its fourth launch of 2025. Sir Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, highlighted the significance of this achievement: "Deploying an entire constellation to precise orbits on the customers' timeline in under a year demonstrates the advantages of dedicated Electron launches. Accomplishing this alongside another launch from the same site just days earlier underscores Electron's position as a leader in satellite deployment. We are honored to work with Kineis again to rapidly bring their IoT constellation online." Kineis Chief Technology Officer, Michel Sarthou, praised the collaboration: "This fifth launch with Rocket Lab marks a defining moment for Kineis: the completion of our constellation deployment in under a year. I applaud the dedication and expertise of the Kineis team, Rocket Lab, and all our partners in successfully overcoming this tremendous challenge together."

Title: Defiance Launches RKLX and HIMZ: 2X Leveraged ETFs for Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers

March 13, 2025 01:00 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs introduces RKLX and HIMZ, two 2X leveraged single-stock ETFs designed to provide amplified exposure to Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) and Hims & Hers Health Inc. (NYSE: HIMS). These ETFs offer traders a way to seek enhanced returns on Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers without requiring a margin account. “RKLX and HIMZ offer compelling opportunities for investors seeking amplified exposure to Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers, two companies driving innovation in their respective industries,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. “With increasing demand for satellite technology and digital healthcare solutions, Rocket Lab and Hims & Hers continue to play key roles in shaping the future of space exploration and telehealth.” For more information, visit DefianceETFs.com These Funds are not intended to be used by, and are not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Funds pursue a daily leveraged investment objective, making them riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage, as they magnify the performance of their respective underlying securities. These Funds are not suitable for all investors. They are designed for knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, recognize the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to frequently monitor their portfolios. Over periods longer than a single day, the Funds may lose value even if their underlying securities increase in performance, and they will lose value if the underlying securities remain flat. An investor could lose the full principal value of their investment within a single day. An investment in RKLX is not an investment in Rocket Lab USA, Inc. An investment in HIMZ is not an investment in Hims & Hers Health Inc. About Defiance ETFs Founded in 2018, Defiance is at the forefront of ETF innovation. Defiance is a leading ETF issuer specializing in thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs. Our first-mover leveraged single-stock ETFs empower investors to take amplified positions in high-growth companies, providing precise leverage exposure without the need to open a margin account. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds’ may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. RKLB and HIMS Risks: The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of HIMS. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of HIMS even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. RKLB and HIMS are not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and are not involved with this offering in any way and have no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. Trading Risk. The trading price of the fund may be subject to volatility and could experience wide fluctuations due to various factors. Short sellers may also play a significant role in trading RKLB and HIMS potentially affecting the supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. Public perception and external factors beyond the company’s control may influence RKLB’s and HIMS’s stock price disproportionately. Performance Risk. RKLB and HIMS may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of RKLB and HIMS to decline. RKLB Aerospace & Defense Industry Risks. Companies in the aerospace and defense industry are subject to risks stemming from their reliance on government budgets and spending priorities, which can fluctuate due to political and economic pressures. The aerospace and defense industry is also affected by geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and regulatory changes that can impact market access and operational efficiency. Aerospace and defense companies typically rely on complex supply chains for specialized components and materials. Additionally, technological advancements are critical for maintaining competitiveness in this sector, but the high cost and uncertain outcomes of research and development efforts may pose financial risks. Companies in this industry face heightened cybersecurity risks due to the sensitive nature of their technologies, and breaches can lead to operational disruptions, reputational damage, and regulatory scrutiny. RKLB Business Risks. RKLB has experienced rapid growth, with its employee base and operations expanding substantially in recent years, placing considerable demands on its management, operational infrastructure, and financial resources. Continued growth is dependent on RKLB’s ability to scale its revenue, improve operational efficiencies, and maintain profitability while effectively managing its increasingly complex organizational structure. Additionally, interruptions from information technology failures, cybersecurity breaches, or other infrastructure issues could disrupt operations. RKLB’s ability to comply with applicable regulations and adapt to changes in the industry also presents ongoing risks. HIMS Healthcare Providers & Services Industry Risks. The healthcare providers and services industry can be significantly affected by changing economic conditions, evolving patient demographics, and fluctuations in demand for healthcare services. Changes in healthcare regulations and policies, including those related to insurance coverage and reimbursement, can materially impact the industry. Additionally, the industry faces risks related to litigation, operational disruptions, and evolving technologies that may alter traditional service delivery models. HIMS Business Risks. HIMS operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from established healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceutical companies, and technology firms, which may affect its competitive position. Additionally, the success of HIMS is heavily reliant on its brand reputation, relationships with healthcare providers and medical groups, and compliance with complex healthcare and pharmacy regulations. Security breaches, data loss, legal proceedings, or regulatory changes could harm its operations and reputation. RKLX and HIMZ Fund Risks Leverage Risk. The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Security will be magnified. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Daily rebalancing of the Fund’s holdings pursuant to its daily investment objective causes a much greater number of portfolio transactions when compared to most ETFs. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Markets for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural disasters, epidemics/pandemics, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the United States. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, leverage, imperfect daily correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from two times (200%) the Underlying Security’s performance, before the Fund’s management fee and other expenses. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades.

March 11, 2025 20:21 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Rocket Lab USA class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/RKLB or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).
