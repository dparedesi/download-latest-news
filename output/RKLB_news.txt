November 18, 2025 13:12 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it successfully launched a suborbital mission with its HASTE launch vehicle for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) - advancing national interests in safeguarding the homeland through the testing of advanced technologies for missile defense. The launch on HASTE – Rocket Lab’s commercial launch vehicle for regular and reliable hypersonic test flights – took place from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, at 13:00 UTC/08:00 a.m. ET on November 18, 2025. Led by MDA, the mission deployed a government-provided primary payload developed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and multiple secondary payloads by federal and industry partners, which tested key technologies for missile defense applications. The mission was contracted to Rocket Lab through the DIU’s Hypersonic and High-Cadence Airborne Testing Capabilities (HyCAT) program, an initiative supporting test and evaluation of new and emerging hypersonic technologies through low cost, responsive and long endurance flight testing. The mission launched within 14 months of contract signing, demonstrating streamlined operational benefits for government customers through Rocket Lab’s commercial speed, innovation, and efficiency. The mission also exemplified the cost and schedule savings that commercial liquid launch vehicles can bring to the MDA test community for developmental testing, non-traditional targets testing, and risk-reduction payload testing activities. Rocket Lab’s Vice President Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, says: “HASTE is an important platform for accelerating hypersonic technology readiness for the nation, and we’re proud to be delivering this mission for DIU and MDA.” LtCol Nicholas Estep, Director of DIU’s Emerging Technology Portfolio, says: “Accessing the commercial and non-traditional ecosystem is a key enabler to accelerating progress in the hypersonics community of interest, particularly for closing mission timelines and driving towards mass and affordability. Working with MDA to demonstrate commercially-focused sub-orbital launch services is a great example of that axiom.” The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth launch of its HASTE rocket since the launch vehicle’s debut in 2023. A suborbital variant of Electron - the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket - HASTE includes much of the same innovative technology as Electron, including carbon fiber composite structures and 3D printed rocket engines, but has a modified upper Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic technology tests and a larger payload capacity. HASTE can deploy technologies at speeds of more than 7.5km per second to test air-breathing, glide, and ballistic payloads, as well as technologies to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from space. Combined, the HASTE and Electron launch vehicles have deployed 200+ payloads for government and commercial customers to date.

November 18, 2025 08:44 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs proudly announces the launch of the Defiance Daily Target 2X Short RKLB ETF (Ticker: RKLZ), expanding its family of single-stock leveraged ETFs designed for sophisticated traders seeking tactical exposure to high-growth innovation companies. RKLZ seeks to deliver -200% of the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB), offering investors an instrument to express short-term bearish views on a leading player in the space launch and aerospace manufacturing industry. Investment Objective The Fund seeks daily inverse investment results, before fees and expenses, of -2 times (-200%) the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB). The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period other than a single trading day. Underlying Stock: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. As one of the leading providers of small satellite launch services, Rocket Lab develops and operates its Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, as well as the Photon spacecraft platform. The company’s mission is to open access to space to improve life on Earth, supporting a wide range of applications across defense, research, and commercial communications sectors. An investment in RKLZ is not an investment in Rocket Lab Corporation The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged inverse (–2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund pursues daily leveraged inverse investment objectives, which means it is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage. The Fund magnifies the inverse performance of the Underlying Security and is designed strictly for short-term use. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund’s performance will be the result of compounded daily returns, which is very likely to differ from –200% of the return of RKLB over the same period. It is possible investors could lose their entire principal within a single trading day. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the Fund may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single issuer or sector may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee the Fund’s strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of their investment. RKLB Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s inverse investment strategy, the Fund enters into swap contracts and options contracts based on the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (“RKLB”) common stock (the “Underlying Security”). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of the Underlying Security, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect -2X exposure to changes in the share price of the Underlying Security, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Underlying Security’s share price increases. If the share price of the Underlying Security increases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: Indirect Investment in RKLB Risk. Rocket Lab Corporation is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates, and is not involved with this offering in any way. RKLB has no obligation to consider the Fund or its shareholders in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Fund shares. RKLB Good Performance Risk. The market value of Rocket Lab Corporation may increase if the company achieves or exceeds its business goals, expands its partnerships with government or commercial clients, or benefits from favorable policy, funding, or market sentiment toward the aerospace and satellite sectors. Innovations in propulsion and launch vehicle technology, successful missions, or heightened investor enthusiasm could further contribute to stock price appreciation, adversely impacting the Fund’s inverse exposure. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific factors may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than diversified investments. The Fund focuses on a single equity security and may fluctuate sharply compared to the broader market. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will result from each day’s returns compounded over time, likely differing from -200% of the Underlying Security’s performance before fees and expenses. Compounding effects are magnified during volatile markets and extended holding periods. Daily Correlation/Tracking Risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of inverse correlation to RKLB’s share performance. Market disruptions or high volatility may cause the Fund’s exposure to exceed or fall short of its target -200% objective. Leverage Risk. The Fund will seek -2X inverse exposure through financial instruments such as swaps and options, which can amplify both gains and losses. Leverage increases volatility, and losses may exceed the Underlying Security’s gains on any given day. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk that counterparties to its derivative positions may default, experience insolvency, or fail to perform obligations. The Fund may be unable to recover its investment or experience delays in recovery. Derivatives and Options Risk. The Fund’s investments in swaps and options involve heightened risks including market volatility, imperfect correlation with underlying securities, and liquidity or valuation challenges. Option contracts, in particular, are influenced by actual and anticipated volatility and can rapidly change in value. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, their value will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Rising rates typically cause declines in fixed income prices, particularly for longer-duration instruments. Other factors such as credit, extension, and prepayment risks may also negatively affect the Fund’s NAV. Rebalancing Risk. If the Fund cannot rebalance its portfolio or rebalances incorrectly, its exposure may deviate materially from its -2X investment objective, increasing risk and reducing performance accuracy. Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of assets in a single issuer or small number of issuers, resulting in greater potential loss. Liquidity Risk. Derivative positions or certain underlying securities may become illiquid during periods of market stress, impeding the Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. New Fund Risk. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history, which may increase uncertainty in achieving its investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage commissions may apply.

November 13, 2025 23:57 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Nov. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced its two Explorer-class spacecraft for NASA and the University of California Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory have been successfully launched, beginning their journey to Mars to study the Red Planet’s magnetosphere. NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission was launched by Blue Origin on November 13, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 03:55 p.m. EST. Rocket Lab has successfully established contact with the spacecraft and they are generating power. Now in orbit, the spacecraft will undergo commissioning by Rocket Lab’s spacecraft operations team in the coming days, beginning with early checkouts including orientation stabilization and solar array deployment, followed by commissioning of flight computers, multiple antenna, guidance and navigation sensors and actuators, and the propulsion system leading up to the mission’s first maneuvers. Rocket Lab’s Explorer-class spacecraft platform is a high delta-V, interplanetary member of its advanced satellite family. From contract award to launch, ESCAPADE moved from design to spacecraft completion in just three and a half years – an aggressive timeline for a Mars mission. This was made possible by the Company’s vertically integrated supply chain, which brings the production of solar arrays, reaction wheels, propellant tanks, star trackers, radios, avionics, flight software, and more entirely in-house. “Mars missions have historically been measured in decades and come with price tags in the billions or hundreds of millions. With this mission we’re bringing Mars closer, proving real interplanetary science can be done faster and more cost-effectively to unlock the solar system,” said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. “ESCAPADE is a major first, not just for Rocket Lab, but for commercial interplanetary science. It’s the result of bold goals from NASA and UC Berkeley, enabled by our end-to-end spacecraft capabilities. We’re proud to play a part in this mission and even prouder to know they’re continuing our legacy at the Red Planet.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: "As PI, I'm very grateful to have a top-notch joint ops team at UC Berkeley and Rocket Lab taking care of the twin spacecraft out there in space. I'm both elated and relieved to see NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft healthy post-launch and looking forward to the next chapter of their journey to help us understand Mars' dynamic space weather environment." Now in orbit, a complex and extended journey begins for Blue and Gold, with trajectory design led by Advanced Space LLC. The alignment between Earth and Mars does not currently allow ESCAPADE to use a traditional direct-to-Mars transfer. Instead, ESCAPADE will launch into a “loiter” (or “Earth-proximity”) orbit that loops around Earth’s Lagrange point 2 (about a million miles from Earth, opposite the Sun) until the next planetary alignment window. Once the planets have reached the ideal alignment in fall 2026, the ESCAPADE spacecraft will use an Earth gravity assist to begin the journey to Mars. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab and UC Berkeley spacecraft operators will command the spacecraft to conduct deep-space maneuvers, known as trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs). The TCMs will boost the spacecraft’s energy to reach Mars and provide navigation control to target their unique orbit insertion corridors. The spacecraft are scheduled to arrive at Mars in September 2027. The spacecraft will begin to transition to their first science formation in 2028. ESCAPADE will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips ions from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.
