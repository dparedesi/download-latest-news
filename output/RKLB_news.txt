The mission, designated "IOT 4 You and Me," launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand at 9:43 AM NZDT on 9 February (20:43 UTC), placing the five satellites into a 647 km low Earth orbit. This launch represents Rocket Lab's first Electron mission of 2025, and the fourth dedicated mission for Kineis, bringing the total Electron launches to 59. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, commented: "That's four launches completed, and just one more to go for Kineis. We'll have their entire constellation deployed in less than a year-a remarkable achievement in itself. Many constellation operators experience longer delays for their first launches, let alone a complete constellation in operation. Once again, Electron proves to be a reliable, precise launcher, enabling our customers to customize their mission plans and timelines." Michel Sarthou, CTO of Kineis, added: "Achieving the production of 25 nanosatellites and launching them into orbit within eight months is an extraordinary accomplishment. With this fourth launch, Kineis is a step closer to providing full global IoT coverage through our constellation of 25 nanosatellites. This milestone reflects the expertise and dedication of our team and our partners like Rocket Lab. We are deeply appreciative of the support we've received since Kineis was founded." The Kineis constellation aims to enable connectivity and real-time data transmission from the most remote parts of the globe, all while consuming minimal energy and maintaining low bit-rate communication. The constellation will support a range of applications, including forest fire monitoring, water resource management, infrastructure and energy network oversight, and transportation logistics tracking. Kineis is now one launch away from completing its constellation. The date for the fifth mission in this series will be revealed in the upcoming weeks. The next Electron mission, scheduled for later in February, will be announced with customer details and the specific launch window shortly.
