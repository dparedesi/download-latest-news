This mission, titled "The Lightning God Reigns," is set to lift off from Rocket Lab's private launch facility, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, in New Zealand. The launch window opens on March 10 UTC.

The Blue Ghost 1 lander's performance was bolstered by Rocket Lab's advanced software, which provides critical functions such as commanding, telemetry processing, autonomous sequencing, attitude determination, guidance, navigation, control, and fault protection. These capabilities ensured mission success across all operational phases, from launch to lunar touchdown. Rocket Lab's Mission Operations Center in Littleton, Colorado, operated as a remote and backup control hub for Firefly's primary operations base in Texas. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab's spacecraft operations team collaborated closely with Firefly's Blue Ghost operations team in both Colorado and Texas. Their responsibilities included orbit determination, maneuver planning, command generation, and continuous monitoring of the lander's guidance, navigation, and control systems to ensure a smooth journey and landing. In addition to software support, Rocket Lab contributed three high-efficiency solar power assemblies, mounted on the lander's sides and top deck. These systems provided a total of 400 W of power, sustaining operations for the mission's 1,470-hour duration. "Congratulations to the Firefly team for the successful landing of the Blue Ghost 1 mission, a remarkable accomplishment achieved by few," said Kyle Andringa, Rocket Lab's Senior Director Space Systems Software. "Rocket Lab is honored to support this mission with our flight-proven space software and state-of-the-art components." Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, aimed at advancing lunar exploration and scientific research by delivering cutting-edge instruments and technology demonstrations to the Moon.

Rocket Lab is an aerospace company that provides launch services and space systems solutions for the space and defense industries. The Rocket Lab class action lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, the defendants made false or misleading statements and failed to disclose that Rocket Lab’s three planned barge landing tests faced significant delays. A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.
